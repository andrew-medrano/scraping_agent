The hydrogel does not degrade in water and is consistent in production and mechanical properties for specific applications. The solution is a series of hydrogel compositions that are responsive to temperature, applied pressure (shear thinning) and chemical crosslinking. Because of these properties, the hydrogel compositions can be uniformly embedded with a loading agent, extrusion (\u201c3D\u201d) printed, and crosslinked. The resulting crosslinked hydrogel structures do not chemically or physically degrade in water under ambient conditions and can therefore be used in various chemical processes involving the loading agent. Existing batch processes lead to various inefficiencies. Existing hydrogel production is time intensive, inconsistent, and yields poor mechanical properties, limiting the adoption of the technology. This hydrogel-based technology would enable continuous processes instead of batch processes, eliminating many inefficiencies. This is enabled by the hydrogel structures that do not degrade in water. The fabrication methods can allow for consistent and rapid production coupled with a very broad range of mechanical properties, allowing for the mechanical properties to be tuned for each specific application.",

    "ip_description": "This technology offers a power system stabilizer architecture to improve the control and interactions in bulk system dynamics. It utilizes a real-time estimates of the center-of-inertia speed and create a flexible set of trade-offs between transient and small-signal response. The delicate balance between synchronizing and damping torque components in a synchronous machine creates a conflicting set of stability-oriented exciter performance requirements. Power system stabilizers (PSS) have long played a critical role in satisfying these requirements; however, changes in bulk system dynamics pose challenges to existing control strategies. As inverter-coupled variable generation displaces synchronous machines, electric grids lose inertia and traditional sources of voltage support and oscillation damping. Correspondingly, the rapid growth of power electronic loads has the potential to make the system load stiffer with respect to changes in voltage. In parallel with these changes, wide-area measurement systems (WAMS) have transformed power system monitoring. The deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) has made it possible to implement control strategies that act on information transmitted over long geographic distances in nearly real time. The solution is a new PSS architecture that can be viewed as a generalization of the standard Delta-omega (speed deviation) stabilizer. This control strategy stems from a time-varying linearization of the equations of motion for a synchronous machine. It utilizes a real-time estimate of the center-of-inertia speed derived from a set of wide-area measurements. Using this technique, it is possible to almost wash out steady-state changes completely in rotor speed from the control error. Consequently, it creates a flexible set of trade-offs between transient and small-signal response. Basing the control error not only on local information but also on changes in the system operating point can improve frequency response and rotor angle stability, particularly in stressed systems. Existing power system stabilizers have challenges when dealing with changes in bulk system dynamics. In comparison to traditional approaches, this strategy offers improved control over interactions between the PSS and automatic voltage regulator (AVR).",

    "ip_description": "This technology utilizes a microfluidic perfusion device and tumor tissue from cancer patients to predict a drug response at the time of diagnosis. This approach will guide the individual care for patients. Drug prediction in cancer patients is often inaccurate. This is due to the heterogeneity of tumors and the difficulty associated with re-constructing a model for a given tumor. Therapy choice is often guided by population-based averages that do not reflect differences between tumors or between patients with a specific type of tumor. One approach to address this issue is DNA sequencing for personalized chemotherapy. DNA sequencing is utilized to capture key genetic mutations and to identify the drugs that specifically target these mutations. This genetic approach, however, does not account for the tumor microenvironment. In addition, tumor slice cultures have been used as a model for drug prediction. Tumor slices, however, may only be produced from large tumors and only after surgical extraction. This invention provides a simple, predictive test of tumor chemosensitivity that is applied directly to tumor material or to any other tissue whose chemosensitivity or response to chemical, pharmacologic or biological perturbation needs to be assessed for diagnosis, therapeutic decision-making or as a guide to potential treatment-associated toxicity. This invention is based on a microfluidic platform that uses tumor material taken at the time of tissue sampling for histopathologic diagnosis. Tumor tissue in the form of a core biopsy or slice is placed in a laminar-flow microfluidic perfusion device. This is used to establish a histopathologic diagnosis for drug prediction, and permits a large number of drugs or reagents to be tested on the sample tissue core or slice. Population-based averages do not reflect differences between patients, and DNA sequencing does not account for the tumor microenvironment. Tumor slice cultures have been used as a model for drug prediction, but they can only be produced from large tumors after surgical extraction. The benefits and advantages of this invention is a more accurate prediction of drug responses and tumor chemosensitivity that can be applied directly to tumor biopsy material at the time of diagnosis. Thus, the apparatus and methods may help guide the choice of initial therapy in individual cancer patients.",

This development could be used for high-throughput and autonomous microfluidics, soft-robotics, point-of-care diagnostics, implantable microdevices, tissue engineering and organ-on-a-chip systems. Microfluidics has had a great impact in a broad range of areas, from biological analysis and basic cell biology to chemical synthesis or optics. Microfluidic systems are usually built by replica-molding and bonding in elastomers, such as PDMS or thermoplastics, such as PMMA or polystyrene. These polymers owe their success to four key properties: biocompatibility, transparency, low cost, and being copyright-free. PDMS, in addition, is also elastomeric\u2014a property that is key for producing fluidic automation components\u2014and gas-permeable\u2014a key factor for allowing O2 and CO2 exchange in cell culture applications. Although applications are not lacking and PDMS molding is able to produce micron-resolution features, PDMS mold fabrication requires a lengthy manual procedure. Furthermore, complex devices need to be fabricated by layering, which severely restricts the possible 3D geometries. In order to be cost-effective, molded devices have to be produced in large numbers, require large initial capital investments, and they cannot be customized in short time frames. An alternative rapid plastic fabrication method allowing for more complex geometries and multi-height structures that are not limited to layers is micromilling; however, micromilling still requires assembly and bonding to produce closed channels, and the milling tool cannot cut arbitrary shapes. Stereolithography 3D printing has recently attracted attention for custom-fabricated complex microfluidic systems for research and development due to its automated 3D fabrication, rapidly decreasing costs, and improving resolution. However, available Stereolithography resins do not have all the favorable physicochemical properties of the above-named polymers. A need exists to improve Stereolithography 3D-printing methods to provide PDMS SL 3D-printed structures. The solution is a new formulation of a PDMS-acrylate resin for 3D-printing elastomeric structures at high resolution using UV based stereolithography. When printed, this elastomeric PDMS is optically transparent and can be made with mechanical properties similar to thermally cured PDMS, which has been extensively used for a wide variety of applications. This enables printing of enclosed microchannels with sub-millimeter resolution with assembly-free fabrication of microfluidic devices. This could be used for high-throughput and autonomous microfluidics, soft-robotics, point-of-care diagnostics, implantable microdevices, tissue engineering and organ-on-a-chip systems. Existing microfluidic systems require large production and a large initial investment, while being limited in 3D geometries. Existing stereolithography resins do not have the desired physicochemical properties of thermally cured PDMS. This system allows for the custom fabrication of complex microfluidic systems for research and development due to its automated 3D fabrication, rapidly decreasing costs, and improving resolution, while also having the desired physiochemical properties of biocompatibility, transparency, elasticity, and gas permeability.",

This system can prevent tooth and gum disease before it occurs and produce proper patient care. Biofilm formation is a major problem in oral healthcare, food processing environments and on surgical instruments in a medical environment. Oral biofilms may be a medium that enables tooth decay or the tooth decay process of acidification and enamel demineralization. It is known that pH measurements can indicate the risk of biofilm formation and thus tooth decay in patients. However, technologies for examining and measuring this oral biofilm in early disease stages do not exist, leading to biofilm formation and growth. The solution is a system and method for accurate optical pH sensing of biofilms. The pH level is measured using multiple wavelengths emitted by a fluorescent substance (fluorescein). This device emits an excitation light, which collects emitted light and processes the data. This can be done in normal lighting conditions at a dentist\u2019s clinic. Existing solutions rely on treating the cavities once they form, instead of preventing them before they occur.

    "ip_description": "Application of acoustic fields while making a battery electrode can rapidly transform a random slurry of battery materials into organized structures, regardless of what those exact materials may be. This change boosts both how much energy the battery can store and how fast it can charge, sidestepping a fundamental tradeoff in conventional battery manufacturing.\n\nIn conventional battery manufacturing, there is a built-in tradeoff between the energy an electrode can hold and the power it can deliver. A thicker electrode can contain more active material to hold energy, but this results in a longer path the lithium must travel during charging or discharging, significantly hindering high power performance. This fundamental tradeoff is due to the random distribution of active material in conventional manufacturing processes.\n\nTo decouple power and energy, active material can instead be patterned into a 3-dimensional structure. 3D-structured electrodes have previously been shown to increase both power and energy by over 10%. However, the current methods used to research these electrodes are not scalable due to slow speeds, material-specific requirements, or quality issues.\n\nThe technology uses acoustic waves to rapidly organize the active material in an electrode, from a random structure to regular patterns. The acoustic waves can be varied for different spacings or combined with other acoustic waves for two dimensional patterns. As a result of this structure in place of randomness, the difficulty lithium faces moving through the material is greatly reduced. A battery built on such a technology would be able to both provide more power, while carrying more energy.\n\nIn other approaches to 3D-structuring, drawbacks have included high costs, long processing times and specific requirements on what battery materials can be used. Acoustic patterning, on the other hand, happens in seconds regardless of what the material is made out of. The relative ease of applying an acoustic field coupled with the short processing time and lack of material requirements makes this process significantly more scalable than its competitors.\n\nA battery built on this technology could reap the benefits of 3D-structuring without the typical costs of other methods. Unlike today's batteries relying on conventional manufacturing, the energy storage and power delivery capability can both be improved instead of being inversely linked.",

    "ip_description": "This technology offers an active control of stationary vortices for aerodynamic structures to reduce CO2 emissions. This system enables skin friction reduction, a reduced drag, and an increased thermodynamic efficiency in engine use cases.\n\nFuel is the largest direct operating cost for airlines. Furthermore, the emissions of CO2 are a growing environmental concern, and the water vapor emissions at high altitude may also play a role in the Earth's radiation budget and climate. If the aerodynamic drag of an aircraft is reduced, the engine thrust and, consequently, emissions can also be reduced. A significant component of the total drag is friction on the outer layer of the aircraft. On large aircraft, the boundary layers between the aircraft and the passing air are almost completely turbulent (rough air flow), having relatively large skin friction coefficients. Decreasing the coefficient by transitioning to smooth air flow (laminar flow) at the boundary layer could decrease drag. In many other devices, a relatively high heat transfer coefficient in turbulent boundary layers limits the performance of the device. For example, heat transfer to the turbine blades can limit efficiency of modern aircraft turbine engines, because the turbine blades overheat in operation. As another example, rocket nozzles must be cooled to prevent melting. The cooling mechanism adds weight, complexity, and failure modes to these rocket engines. Consequently, in many applications it is desirable to delay the turbulent flow by maintaining the laminar flow at the wall as long as possible.\n\nThe solution is a system for active control of stationary vortices for aerodynamic structures. In many cases, transition from a laminar flow to a turbulent flow is accompanied with vortex formation and movement close to a solid wall. Controlling these vortices can enable the preservation of laminar air flow. Active control of vortices over a solid surface is done by sensing locations of vortices with printed skin sensors and maintaining the vortices in their fixed spanwise positions with respect to the solid surface by actuation of printed skin actuators. This active control of stationary vortices will enable skin friction reduction.\n\nExternal structures on airplanes are engineered to reduce drag, but these structures eventually lead to turbulent air flow. With some conventional technologies in engines, excess diluent air must be added into the hot combustor gasses to prevent melting of the blades. As a result, the peak cycle temperature of these turbines is reduced, thus lowering their thermodynamic efficiency and fuel economy. This system eliminates these inefficiencies by controlling the stational vortices, which enables skin friction reduction, reducing drag, and increasing thermodynamic efficiency in engine use cases.",

    "ip_description": "Innovations in medical imaging techniques more and more medical information to be gathered from a single biopsy sample, but pathologist review of such large datasets becomes prohibitively time intensive. This technology provides an AI-driven method for the triage of a 3D pathology dataset for review by a doctor, with areas of concern elevated to the doctor\u2019s attention for review in order to detect disease faster and more accurately. As the information available to pathologists from biopsy specimens increases, the importance of identifying the most important data for pathologist review becomes paramount for timely analysis of each sample. In an example case, prevention of esophageal cancer requires the review of endoscopic screening biopsies for tumors. Through the use of open-top light-sheet microscopy, a 3D visualization of the biopsy specimen can be non-destructively generated from a sample. This greatly improves the amount of information available as compared to conventional slide-based histology, typically consisting of 4 to 16 2D images (~1% of the total sample). Slide-based histology also results in the destruction of the sample, precluding any additional analysis of areas not selected for review. This increase in information should increase the likelihood that cancer can be detected. However, there is an unmet need in the processing of this type of 3D dataset to identify the most important information for pathologists to review, as the human analysis of the entire 3D dataset for every biopsy is impractical. The technology is a two-step data driven method for the triage of a 3D pathology dataset into a manageable number of 2D image sections as would be given in conventional histology, while maintaining the advantages of increased data available from modern methods such as the OTLS platform. The first step is the creation of a 3D heatmap of the biopsy sample, indicating the likelihood of disease at every point across the sample. This could be done through the aggregation of predictions generated by a deep learning model trained on pathologist annotations. The second step is the identification of 2-dimensional sections with the greatest probability of containing disease tissue, using the 3D heatmap as data for a method such as a classification algorithm. The final output is a set of 2D medical images for pathologist review with the highest likelihood of containing the tumor or other disease markers, reducing pathologist workload while increasing the diagnostic sensitivity. This technology is built on the OTLS platform for analysis of biopsy samples, making the input data for the technology higher quality than the data collected via conventional slide histology. This allows for non-destructive collection of entire 3D pathology datasets, as opposed to limited cross-sectional images from slide mounted samples. The two-step method for analyzing the resulting information-dense 3D dataset both increases the diagnostic sensitivity of screenings such as the crucial endoscopic screening for EAC prevention and reduces the workload on pathologists to the analysis of only the most important 2D sections. This triage of 3D data into 2D sections also outputs data in a format familiar to pathologists: a set of 2D images that can be false-colored to appear like conventional slide-histography samples. This minimizes the retraining of pathologists needed for clinical adoption of the method and retains a paradigm that keeps the pathologist 'in the loop'.",

This system can accommodate varying air densities and be mechanically tuned between the thruster\u2019s anode and cathodes. Since the launch of the first commercial communication satellite in 1962, satellites have changed the landscape of telecommunications and remote sensing/monitoring, becoming progressively specialized in numerous applications. Even with tremendous technological advancement over the years, typical satellites still have some significant challenges. The main drawbacks are found in cost, including the expense of launching them into orbit, repairing/maintaining them while in operation, and developing payloads that can withstand the harshness of space. To overcome some of these limitations, recent work has produced \u201catmospheric satellites.\u201d These aircraft typically have wings and fly at twice the height of commercial airliners, and they can maintain flight for years by using solar energy. These crafts have the benefit of being closer to the ground, ensuring less susceptibility to signal degradation, and can be slow-moving to operate in one local area, unlike low-orbiting satellites that move much too quickly across the sky. In spite of the promise from atmospheric satellites, there is much development necessary to perfect this platform. One significant consideration is the variability of pressure in the atmosphere; depending on the operational altitude, the density of air changes affecting the vehicle\u2019s efficiency. In this innovation, a novel design for air-breathing plasma thrusters proposes adaptable electrode spacing to ensure thruster efficiency over a range of atmospheric pressures, while achieving unprecedented thrust. This innovation proposes a platform for indefinite space flight using high-altitude air-breathing plasma thrusters, which does not require on-board propellant. Solar power backed by energy storing batteries will drive the craft\u2019s thrusters. The system expects to operate between 40,000 and 90,000 feet, with a stable flight altitude between 60,000 and 80,000 feet. Through thin-air superheating, the thruster will produce a weakly ionized plasma to achieve a pioneering thrust level. At the center of this technology is a unique variable electrode spacing system that allows its adaptability to a wide range of air pressures. A series of gear bars and an inner gear (driven by a servo motor) adjust the relative spacing between 12 copper cathode bars configured radially around a central anode. This adaptable spacing can accommodate varying air densities in the main discharge section of the thruster. Current solutions suffer from variability of pressure in the atmosphere; depending on the operational altitude, the density of air changes affecting the vehicle\u2019s efficiency. The innovation describes an air-breathing plasma thruster that boasts a wide atmospheric operation range due to its novel variable electrode spacing.

    "ip_description": "This technology is a novel method to design protein scaffolds to bind and neutralize amyloid-forming proteins, offering a potential therapeutic intervention for diseases associated with amyloid fibrils. Amyloid fibrils, self-associated segments of proteins, are implicated in many diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and type 2 diabetes. These proteins contain segments that are intrinsically disordered, making it difficult to generate binders or inhibitors targeting these regions due to its conformational flexibility. Current therapeutic strategies often fail to effectively target these amyloid-forming proteins, leaving a significant unmet need in the treatment of these conditions. The technology involves the use of de novo designed protein scaffolds that contain deep peptide binding clefts. These clefts bind to segments of amyloid-forming proteins, effectively neutralizing them. The technology has been successfully applied to segments of several amyloid-forming proteins, including Transthyretin, Tau, Serum amyloid A1, and A\u03b242. The A\u03b2 binders, in particular, have been shown to block the assembly of A\u03b2 fibrils as effectively as the most potent clinically tested antibodies to date.

    "ip_description": "The technology is a robust control system that enables users to readily distinguish between DNA and its expressed RNA template in bacteria. The innovation consists of an E. coli plasmid that expresses a bacterial antibiotic resistance gene into which a self-splicing intron has been inserted. After transcription, the intron is rapidly and autocatalytically excised from the mRNA, such that the mature mRNA does not contain it. Primers can be designed to flank the self-splicing intron in a configuration that is unable to amplify the DNA target due to its prohibitively large size, but which is able to amplify the RNA template after it has undergone successful splicing, thus achieving specificity for RNA only. Alternatively, primers can be designed to target the intron to specifically identify the presence of DNA, since the self-splicing intron will not be present in the expressed RNA template. The competitive advantage of this technology lies in its ability to differentiate between RNA and DNA during clinical testing. This innovation can greatly improve the accuracy of diagnostic tests and is applicable in a wide range of laboratory-based and point-of-care tests clinical molecular diagnostic tests. As the global diagnostic testing market size is valued at $179.9 billion in 2022 with an expected CAGR of 8.6%, there is a significant opportunity for this technology to advance the field of diagnostic and point-of-care testing.",

    "ip_description": "This technology uses a low voltage and modern bulk- complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor design that are highly programmable and allow experimentation with waveforms and simulation patterns for topologies. Rapid advances in understanding brain function, neural connectivity and neural plasticity are providing opportunities to develop systems to aid the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. Electrical neural stimulators are being used alongside neural recording systems to enable bidirectional interactions with the nervous system and realize new neuroprostheses and rehabilitation methods. In delivering electrical stimuli to neural tissue, biphasic, current-regulated pulses are typically applied between two electrodes using specialized electronics, with the resulting electrode-tissue-interface having a complex electrical impedance (ZE). This requires high headroom voltage and invariant impedance. Current complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS) designs are on silicon, allowing for integration on a single silicon die. While compact, these will be limited by the headroom voltage. A neural stimulator architecture is described which can drive biphasic, constant-current waveforms through a wide range of electrode impedances with approximately \u00b111V compliance, while using a low-voltage, modern bulk-CMOS technology. These are highly programmable; these developed electronics can safely apply current signals synthesized via standard low power integrated current DAC topologies to the electrode/interface (which may sit at a high voltage). Therefore, these electronics empower researchers and clinicians, allowing them to experiment with numerous waveforms and stimulation patterns. Extending CMOS stimulator voltage compliance past individual device limits has been previously investigated. However, voltages exceeding VDD can be created at the driver output, potentially causing device failure, junction breakdowns, and unregulated current through ZE. While ZE should \u201cself-discharge\u201d if given time, it is impractical to have the system design and simulation pattern determined by an empirically found decay rate which could change over time. This system will avoid device failure and allow the clinician to experiment with numerous waveforms and stimulation patterns.",

    "ip_description": "The technology offers innovative antibody compositions that target the FimH adhesin of uropathogenic E. coli, preventing bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections globally, often caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). These infections can lead to severe complications, especially in recurrent cases. Traditional antibiotic treatments are increasingly ineffective due to rising antibiotic resistance, necessitating alternative therapeutic strategies. The technology involves monoclonal antibodies that target the mannose-binding FimH adhesin of UPEC. These antibodies exhibit parasteric inhibition, binding within the FimH binding pocket and displacing mannose non-competitively. This mechanism effectively blocks bacterial adhesion to the bladder epithelium, dissolves biofilms, and prevents infection. The antibodies have shown efficacy in preclinical models, protecting mice from urinary bladder infections. Non-Competitive Inhibition: Unlike traditional inhibitors, these antibodies bind adjacent to the ligand in the binding pocket, providing a unique and effective inhibition mechanism. Biofilm Disruption: The antibodies not only prevent adhesion but also dissolve existing biofilms, addressing both prevention and treatment. Antibiotic Resistance Mitigation: By offering a non-antibiotic approach, this technology helps combat the growing issue of antibiotic resistance. Broad Applicability: The antibodies can be used against various enterobacteria, including Klebsiella species, expanding their potential use beyond UPEC.",

The computing device implements self-learning deep recurrent neural networks as the two artificial networks.\n\nThe human brain is one of the world's most powerful autonomous computers, but nevertheless remains a fragile organ that can be difficult to train and repair. The parallel functions of and similarities between the brain and typical silicon computers have prompted considerable interest in the field of brain-computer interfaces. Brain-computer interfaces may be able to address some of the limitations of the human brain as well as bolster the understanding of an organ with many functions and operations that remain to be understood. Specifically, the computational capabilities of biological neural networks and silicon computers are complementary. For example, human brains commonly transfer information with computers through normal sensory and motor channels. However, transferring information through direct recording of neural activity and electrical stimulation of brain sites is much more challenging.\n\nThe solution is a system for restoring or enhancing neural function by inducing new neural connections in the nervous system of a subject. This consists of a stimulating component coupled to a computing device. The stimulating component is implanted within or worn externally by a subject and is configured to receive a stimulation pattern and stimulate the first region of the nervous system based on the received stimulation pattern to induce a behavioral output from the subject. This behavioral output could be a motor function, a sensory function, a memory function, or another function that is intended to be restored or enhanced. The computing device implements self-learning deep recurrent neural networks as the two artificial networks. The first artificial network receives inputs associated with the nervous system, generates the stimulation pattern based on the received inputs, and outputs the stimulation pattern to the stimulating component. The second artificial network receives the stimulation pattern and predicts the behavioral output from the subject. The computing device can further generate an error signal based on the induced behavioral output and the predicted behavioral output and adjust parameters of the first artificial network based on the error signal.\n\nRecent advances in interface technologies, computing systems, and the understanding of the human brain have sparked new investigations into the potential of brain-computer interfaces that directly record and/or stimulate the brain. These remain investigational and can have inconsistencies with the expected output and the induced output. This system can adjust parameters based on an error signal, allowing for alignment of the expected and induced behavioral output.",

It runs full-length videos through a software where the outputs are edited via a computational model with biological tissue and surgical tool recognition. Surgical videos are commonly used for trainee education, academic publications, and conference presentations. Condensing surgical videos to include only informative scenes can be a largely manual, tedious, and lengthy process. Current automated techniques for condensing surgical videos generally do not provide quality results, as informative scenes are omitted and non-informative scenes are included too often. Video editing remains a manual and time intensive process. The solution is a semi-automated method for video editing surgical videos that includes key scenes that accurately summarizes the surgery. Full-length videos are run through the software, which outputs an edited surgical video that retains key scenes and eliminates non-informative scenes. This is done via a computational model, where images of a source image stream as valid images or invalid images based on whether the images include biological tissue or a surgical tool; and generating a condensed image stream that includes the valid images. Another method includes classifying input images as valid images or invalid images using a clustering algorithm that classifies each of the input images into either a first group or a second group and using labels that indicate whether the input images include a surgical tool. The method also includes training a computational model to identify the valid images based on whether the valid images include biological tissue or a surgical tool, or whether the valid images have at least a threshold level of clarity. Current automated techniques for condensing surgical videos can result in the elimination of informative scenes, or the inclusion of non-informative scenes.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Osteoporosis affects millions of the aging United States population, yet screening for it is below recommended rates. By using pre-existing data to opportunistically search for fractures in vertebral bodies that could indicate osteoporosis, many more cases could be found. This approach uses deep learning technology to search for spinal osteoporotic compression fractures within commonly taken radiograph images acquired for other purposes.\n\nSpinal Osteoporotic Compression Fractures (OCFs) are a significant health concern, often leading to severe pain and a decreased quality of life. One in three individuals living in developed countries will incur one over the course of their life, increasing the risk for subsequent fractures. Screening for osteoporosis, which affects around 9% of individuals over 50 in the United States, occurs nowhere near as frequently as recommended. Screening by detecting OCFs can improve over current screening approaches using bone mineral density which have known limitations. Early detection of these fractures is crucial for effective treatment, but current methods can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation.\n\nThe solution is to use existing data in the form of common imaging of the chest, spine, or abdominal images to opportunistically screen for OCFs. The approach uses a pair of deep learning classifiers that can identify spinal OCFs on radiographs. The first classifier automatically finds the vertebral bodies that are of interest to search, narrowing the given data down to the most relevant piece. The second classifier then determines whether the vertebral body is fractured. Using these two classifiers, the patient is given an overall classification that considers all of the data collected to inform doctors. These classifiers can analyze thousands of vertebral bodies and accurately label them as normal or fractured, providing a fast and efficient method for OCF detection.\n\nEfficiency: These classifiers can analyze a large number of vertebral bodies quickly, making them suitable for large-scale screenings.\n\nAccuracy: Both classifiers have demonstrated high positive predictive values (PPV) and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), indicating their accuracy in identifying OCFs.\n\nAdaptability: The classifiers can be adapted to different criteria systems, providing flexibility in their application.\n\nPotential for Automation: As a critical component of future automated opportunistic screening tools, these classifiers could significantly streamline the process of OCF detection.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Platoons of autonomous vehicles controlled by a centralized adaptive cruise control are vulnerable to disruptions in communications between cars, and unreliable sensing information of the vehicles around them. By building methods to simulate a centralized command during communication loss, and to establish safety margins based on still-reliable sensor information during a sensor failure, a platoon of vehicles can guarantee safety in even emergency situations while suffering communication and sensor loss.\n\nPlatoons of constantly spaced autonomous vehicles promise increases in fuel efficiency, closer inter-car spacing, and improved traffic efficiency over human drivers. With a centralized control method in charge of all platoon vehicles, the single-file line can remain stable even if a single vehicle is forced to swerve or stop. This has the potential to revolutionize the trucking industry, where one human driver can lead an entire platoon of vehicles. However, this scheme is vulnerable to disruptions in communications, and is heavily reliant on accurate sensor information.\n\nIf centralized communication fails, errors in car position grow over time as cars become only aware of their neighbors through on-car sensors. If the data from those sensors is inaccurate, which can happen from extreme lighting, inclement weather, or even intentional attacks, the errors from the decentralized control scheme can lead to serious safety concerns and vehicle collisions.\n\nThere is therefore an unmet need of improving the method of handling communication delays in autonomous vehicle platoons and equipping that method to guarantee safety in a worst-case combination of loss of centralized communication and unreliable sensor data.\n\nThis technology combines the centralized control algorithm of a platoon with a decentralized method in each individual car based on past data. This type of delayed self-reinforcement (DSR) control mimics an ideal centralized command, based on sensor data. When communication is delayed or lost, this mimicked centralized command is followed in place of a decentralized computation based on only the vehicle's neighbors. This leads to improved performance with large delays or loss of communication.\n\nFor disruptions in sensor data, an occlusion-aware algorithm detects the disruption in the sensor. All other available sensors are then used to fill in the gaps. For instance, in the case of a malfunctioning long-range sensor, the short range sensor's inability to detect the car in front shows that the next car is far enough to be out of range of the short range sensor. This type of \"negative\" information can be used to generate a safety limit for the speed of the car, guaranteeing safety even with the disruption of both communications and sensing.\n\nThe DSR-based control scheme decreases the error in vehicle position by 80% compared with a method based only off of detecting nearest neighbors. In addition, in the case of disruption, the DSR-based method decreases the time it takes for the cars to reach consensus again is decreased by 95%.\n\nThe implementation of occlusion-aware algorithms to establish safety margins for vehicles experiencing sensing issues successfully guarantees safety in high-fidelity simulations, even in a worst-case combination of communications loss and an emergency braking. This approach is capable of working even for long disruptions in sensor reliability.\n\nTogether, these technologies increase the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicle platoons by building robustness against two vulnerable points of centralized control.",

    "ip_description": "The solution is a serine protease inhibitor, bikunin, that plays a role in controlling the early immune response to IAV. Bikunin has a single chondroitin sulfate (CS) side chain with one or two heavy chains (HCs) covalently attached to the CS chain. When bikunin and TNF alpha-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6) interact, the HCs are transferred to hyaluronan (HA) to form an extracellular matrix that promotes tissue inflammation. Furthermore, the sulfation of the CS side chains may control TSG-6 activity and the transfer of HCs to an HA matrix. As a result, the structure of bikunin CS side chains is important in blocking tissue inflammation. The design of a bikunin biomimetic will be anti-inflammatory and antiviral since bikunin is a serine protease inhibitor which blocks influenza virus infectivity. The competitive advantage of this technology lies in its ability to provide both anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects in treating IAV infection. This solution could decrease the morbidity and mortality of lung infections by decreasing viral replication and thus reducing lung inflammation and injury. It could also be used for other diseases involving tissue inflammation and injury.

An elastic tube holds the specimen while automatically rotating for the specimen for imaging and reduces the processing of distorted images.\n\nSmall samples of human tissue are often required for a definitive disease diagnosis and prognosis. Needle biopsy specimens from tissue are less invasive and costly than surgically removed tissue samples. Often these needle biopsy tissues are removed from the body in a vital or living state, although chemically-and mechanically fragile. The processing steps often require chemical fixation using alcohol or formalin to halt unwanted chemical changes and prevent mechanical damage. To provide optical contrast in imaging the cells and tissue, stains are applied to highlight different structures, immediate and rapid processing of such specimens can provide valuable information, such as whether the needle was sampled from the tumor and provided an adequate amount of material to make a diagnosis and chemical analysis. The current methods of handling needle biopsy-specimens are a series of manual steps that adhere the cells or thin sections of the tissue onto glass slides for observing the fixed and stained specimen on an optical microscope. This method takes from several hours to several days and is destructive to the cells and tissue. If the needle did not adequately sample the targeted region, such as a tumor, then the patient will need to return to repeat the needle biopsy procedure for a more diagnostic sample, which adds cost, more suffering, and risk of sampling error. Furthermore, the conventional view of the cells and tissue is two-dimensional (2D), and depth information is lost.\n\nThe solution is a device that enables microscopic imaging around the circumferential surface of a biological specimen sampled from tissue by axially stretching an elastic tube that is holding the specimen, thereby temporarily retaining the specimen so that it may be rotated and imaged with precision.

The stent is placed inside and between the two organs that need to be surgically connected to each other, and the barbs on the exterior of the stent will secure the stent to the interior of the intestine and prevent migration of the tube.

If the RADT is negative, a standard culture is performed. However, this approach has its drawbacks. The throat swab can be uncomfortable, especially for young children, making at-home sample collection challenging. Even in a clinical setting, uncooperative children struggling against the unpleasant sensation can negatively impact the quality of the sample. A promising alternative is the detection of GAS pharyngitis through saliva samples; however, the collection of such samples has room to be optimized. Intuitive collection of high-quality saliva samples would both shorten the time required to diagnose strep throat and allow for at-home sample collection to take place. The collected samples can be used with RADT or sent back to the laboratories for qPCR analysis. CandyCollect is a saliva sampling device, inspired by the familiar shape of a lollipop, that can capture high-quality saliva samples. Its intuitive design is such that even young children can use it effectively to collect a sample. The device's open fluidic channels allow the captured bacteria to permeate into the device\u2019s channels, ensuring a robust sample collection. Importantly, this design prevents the tongue from scraping off the captured bacteria during the collection process, thereby preserving the integrity of the sample. The device incorporates a flavored candy, which serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it makes the sampling process more appealing, especially to children. Secondly, the candy is engineered to dissolve over a specific period, thereby providing a built-in timer for the sampling process. Once the flavor dissipates, it signals the end of the sampling period. Intuitive Design: The lollipop-inspired form of CandyCollect makes it instinctively usable, even by young children. This user-friendly design ensures better compliance during sample collection, leading to more reliable results. Built-in Sampling Timer: The flavored candy on the device dissolves over a specific period, providing a built-in timer for the sampling process. This feature informs the user when the sampling process is complete, making the device more intuitive to use. Capability for Mass Production: The design of the device is within the capability of common manufacturing techniques such as injection molding, potentially driving down the price per unit and allowing for easier access to strep throat testing. At-Home Collection: The CandyCollect\u2019s design allows for convenient at-home sample collection. Users can easily collect samples with CandyCollect device and use RADT for rapid test results or ship them back to a lab for PCR analysis, making the process more accessible and flexible.",

    "ip_number": "BDP 8910",
    "published_date": "2018-09-18",
    "ip_description": "CapHarvester aims to replace cumbersome battery power for IoT devices by harnessing the energy from stray electric fields surrounding AC power lines in a home. It avoids the need for an ohmic connection to ground through a capacitive coupling-generated ground reference, allowing for diverse application and placement with minimal safety hazards.\n\nAlong with the proliferation of IoT devices grows the increasing challenge of powering them. Small scale devices such as these face a fundamental trade-off between the range at which they communicate, and the power they have available. In addition, the cost of constantly replacing batteries and the tedious task of tracking their discharge becomes a cumbersome burden, especially when devices are not within easy reach. Given the relatively low power requirements for IoT devices, it is advantageous to explore other potential sources of power commonly available in a home.\n\nPower lines running on alternating current can radiate such energy in the form of electric fields. However, existing efforts to use this leaking energy face several challenges. Some require a connection to an earth ground, making installation difficult and restricting potential applications. Others require the power line to be actively powering a device, restricting the time it can supply power. There is a clear need for an energy harvesting device that can more effectively capture this type of energy.\n\nCapHarvester is a stick-on energy harvester that harnesses the stray electric fields generated around household power lines (110V/230V), without the need to be directly wired to a ground. This is achieved through the use of a capacitive coupling to ground, in place of a direct ohmic connection. These harvesters can be clamped on to any power line regardless of bundling or insulation and can harvest continuously regardless of whether an active load is drawing energy or not.\n\nEase of Use: CapHarvester is a stick-on device needing no modification or connection to ground. This increases both the versatility of application, and the safety of installing and maintaining IoT devices.\n\nVersatility: CapHarvester has been demonstrated in powering 3 real-world applications: Detecting the appliance state by monitoring the power line to the appliance, measuring ambient temperature and building a zone by zone temperature map, and measuring environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity for indoor farming applications.\n\nEnvironmental Impact: By eliminating the need for battery replacements, CapHarvester contributes to reducing electronic waste, making it a more environmentally friendly choice for powering IoT devices.",

Effective drug delivery to specific sites of inflammation or injury remains a significant challenge in medical treatment. Traditional methods often rely on the circulatory system, which can be inefficient, especially in areas with low vascular density or permeability. This inefficiency can lead to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes and increased side effects. In addition, targeting immune cell populations, such as myeloid cells, has recently emerged as a powerful technique in cancer therapy. Myeloid cells, including monocytes and macrophages, play a major role in tumor growth. As a result, there is an opportunity to develop targeted myeloid cell therapies for cancer. The technology involves the development of DNA aptamers that specifically bind to CD36, a receptor protein on the surface of a variety of immune and non-immune cells including monocytes and macrophages. These CD36-binding aptamers can be conjugated with therapeutic agents and delivered directly to the target cells. By leveraging the natural recruitment of monocytes and macrophages to sites of inflammation, injury, or tumor environments, this approach ensures that the therapeutic agents are delivered precisely where they are needed, enhancing efficacy and reducing systemic side effects. Targeted Delivery: Aptamers specifically bind to CD36, ensuring precise delivery of therapeutic agents to the desired site. Enhanced Efficacy: By focusing on the natural recruitment process of immune cells, the technology improves the concentration of drugs at the site of injury or inflammation.

The aptamer can also be used to detect soluble CD62L, a potential diagnostic marker for various diseases. Isolating specific T cell populations is crucial for various medical and research applications, including immunotherapy, disease diagnostics, and fundamental immunological studies. Traditional methods, such as antibody-based cell sorting, can be costly, time-consuming, and sometimes lack the specificity required for effective T cell isolation. The development of aptamers demonstrates a promising alternative to traditional methods by providing a more stable and cost-effective solution for isolating specific T cell populations. This technology introduces an aptamer that specifically binds to the CD62L (L-Selectin) marker on T cells. Aptamers are short, single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules that can fold into unique three-dimensional shapes, allowing them to bind selectively to target molecules. By targeting CD62L, which is expressed on na\u00efve and central memory T cells, this aptamer enables the efficient and specific isolation of these T cell subsets. The process involves binding the aptamer to CD62L, separating the bound T cells, and then recovering the T cells by disrupting the aptamer-CD62L interaction. Specificity: The aptamer provides high specificity for CD62L, ensuring precise isolation of target T cell populations. Cost-Effective: Aptamers can be synthesized chemically, offering a more cost-effective alternative to antibody-based methods.

    "ip_description": "The solution is a novel micro puncture balloon catheter system that makes the Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure safer, easier, and more accessible. Decompensated cirrhosis is a life-threatening complication of advanced liver disease and caused more than 1.48 million deaths globally in 2019 and 56,585 deaths in the US in 2021. A fatal complication in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis is acute variceal bleeding (AVB), one of the major causes of death in patients with cirrhosis. The most effective life-saving procedure to stop AVB is a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), an artificial shunt created between the hepatic vein and the portal vein. The TIPS procedure involves an intrahepatic puncture, which remains one of the most challenging procedures and is associated with high risks of complications in up to 20% of cases even in the hands of experienced Interventional Radiologists. As a result, there is a need to develop alternative methods for TIPS creation with lower technical failure rates and complications. The solution is a medical device that incorporates a more pliable fine needle tip that is less likely to inadvertently puncture non-target tissue than the currently used devices, and in-plane intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and fiber optical borescope for visualization of the area where the shunt is needed. The competitive advantage of this technology lies in its ability to significantly decrease the procedure time, the number of medical staff, consumption of x-ray contrast agent, and prevent the prolonged hospital stay due to complications which will accordingly lower the overall medical cost. The fine needle makes the procedure much less invasive, reduces the high incidence rate of major complications, and significantly lowers the technical challenges of the blind puncture in TIPS procedure, ultimately increasing the availability of TIPS treatment.",

This computational architecture can be beneficial with costly and time-consuming experiments. A high-precision additive manufacturing process, powder bed fusion has enabled unmatched agile manufacturing of a wide range of products from engine components to medical implants. Additive manufacturing has enabled unprecedented fabrication of complex parts from polymeric and metallic powder materials. However, broader adoption of the technology remains challenged by insufficient reliability and in-process variations. These variations are induced by, for example, uncertain laser-material interactions, environmental vibrations, powder recycling, imperfect interactions of mechanical components, and complex thermal histories of materials. Although finite element models and feedback controls have been identified key for predicting and engineering part qualities in powder bed fusion, existing results in each realm are developed in separate computational architectures due to their different time scales, meaning it can take hours or days to simulate the sintering of even a few layers with powder bed fusion. The solution is a first instance closed-loop simulation framework by integrating high-fidelity finite element modeling with feedback controls originally developed for general mechatronics systems. By utilizing the output signals (e.g., melt pool width) retrieved from the finite element model to directly update the control signals (e.g., laser power) sent to the model, the proposed closed-loop framework enables testing the limits of advanced controls in powder bed fusion and surveying the parameter space fully to generate more predictable part qualities. Along the course of formulating the framework, the finite element analysis is verified by comparing its results with experimental and analytical solutions, and then used to understand the melt-pool evolution induced by the in-layer thermomechanical interactions. Current research employs finite element modeling and feedback controls to understand the energy deposition mechanisms and to regulate the in-process variations in powder bed fusion and other additive manufacturing technologies, however this analysis is time consuming. The benefits of this technology are the ability to quickly survey the parameter space fully to generate more predictable part qualities, and quickly design controllers and update parameters for novel materials and printer settings.

In particular, middle-aged and older adults provide a substantial portion of this care in the US. Chronic conditions like cancer, diabetes, or heart disease are among the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, with the responsibility of managing the condition falling onto the patient or family with occasional visits to a provider. This can lead to caregiver burnout commonly characterized by symptoms of fatigue, stress, and disturbances in sleep. In our digital age, there\u2019s a growing demand for online platforms to bridge the gap between family caregivers and providers. However, current platforms fall short. They often lack integrated patient information, leading to repetitive questions and increased burden on both caregivers and providers. Furthermore, they aren\u2019t equipped to handle the emotional toll on caregivers.

The suction attachment will address the concerns of tubes collapsing under vacuum. Attaching suction to irregular surfaces is difficult. Small suction devices can conform to local patches but getting suction to them is difficult since suction tubing collapses more easily. This means having a rigid section separate from the suction surface that reduces the ability of the gripper to conform to surfaces. Soft robots allow for easily conforming to surfaces, but soft vacuum lines can collapse. The solution is to convert softer and smaller possible pressure sources into vacuums near the point where suction is needed. Two or more venturi pump expansion chambers are placed in an elastomeric structure and supplied with high velocity fluid, such as air. The expansion chamber of the venturi pump is connected directly to the exterior of an object to be grasped or can be piped to a separate part of the elastomeric structure that acts as a suction cup. This uses distributed Venturi Pumps to convert positive flow into suction near consumption allowing use of higher flows and smaller features than pumping vacuum. It is easier to pump high speed positive pressure through small tubes than vacuum since a vacuum causes the smaller tubes to collapse, remediating the needs for high stiffness tubes. The Venturi pumps are integrated into a deformable structure allowing them to conform to the surface.

    "ip_description": "This technology involves the design of constitutively active cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) mutants that stimulate a robust immune response without the need for DNA binding. The innate immune system relies on pattern recognition receptors like cGAS to detect intracellular pathogens, DNA damage, and tumorigenesis. However, the activation of cGAS typically requires binding to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which can limit its effectiveness in certain therapeutic applications. The cGAS-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway regulates the innate and adaptive immune responses and elicits type I interferon immunity against viral infections. As a result, it is a promising therapeutic target for cancers and infectious diseases. Current small-molecule STING agonists, which aim to activate the cGAS-STING pathway, often suffer from low efficacy or adverse reactions. Researchers have developed constitutively active cGAS (CA-cGAS) mutants that do not require dsDNA binding to activate. These mutants were created using a combination of two-state computational design and informatics-guided design. The CA-cGAS mutants exhibit interferon-stimulating activity comparable to dsDNA-stimulated wild-type cGAS. X-ray crystallography confirmed the DNA-independent adoption of the active conformation. Additionally, in vivo studies demonstrated that expressing CA-cGAS in tumor cells led to STING-dependent tumor regression, highlighting its therapeutic potential. DNA-Independent Activation: CA-cGAS mutants do not require dsDNA for activation, making them more versatile in various therapeutic contexts. Enhanced Immune Response: These mutants stimulate a robust interferon response, which is crucial for effective immune activation. Therapeutic Potential: In vivo studies show that CA-cGAS can induce tumor regression, indicating its potential as a cancer therapy.

Protein design is a critical aspect of synthetic biology, with applications ranging from drug development to environmental solutions.

Traditional methods require the specification of the fold or secondary structure of the scaffold, which can be complex and time-consuming. The technology leverages deep learning to scaffold functional sites in proteins without needing to pre-specify the fold or secondary structure of the scaffold. It uses two approaches: \u201cconstrained hallucination\u201d and \u201cinpainting\u201d. Constrained hallucination optimizes sequences such that their predicted structures contain the desired functional site. Inpainting starts from the functional site and fills in additional sequence and structure to create a viable protein scaffold in a single forward pass through a specifically trained network. These methods have been used to design candidate immunogens, receptor traps, metalloproteins, enzymes, and protein-binding proteins. The technology offers a more efficient approach to protein design by eliminating the need to pre-specify the fold or secondary structure of the scaffold.

    "ip_description": "The solution is an automated foot process width estimation software that uses deep learning to automatically calculate the average podocyte foot process width and reduce the time it takes to assess kidney disease progression. Podocyte injury plays a key role in many kidney diseases and are often characterized by increased podocyte foot process width (FPW). Although FPW is an important measure of podocyte injury, there is currently no consensus method to measure podocyte FPW. The current gold standard, unbiased stereology, is time-consuming and not widely available. Other methods, such as measuring FPW using tools like Photoshop, takes technicians hours to quantify podocyte injury in kidney tissue. As a result, there is a need to streamline and automate the process of taking FPW measurements. The solution is an automated FPW estimation software that uses deep learning to automatically calculate the average FPW. The software takes in images and labels the glomerular basement membrane to the filtration slit, an intercellular junction that connects adjacent foot processes, using a custom-made machine learning algorithm called ForkNET. Through traditional computer vision techniques, the filtration slits are mapped to their respective membranes and the distance between them is measured to quantify the FPW. The competitive advantage of this technology lies in its ability to quickly measure and quantify podocyte FPW from medical images of kidney tissue in an automated fashion. This deep learning technology will significantly reduce the time it takes to assess kidney disease progression. It is also accessible through a cloud-based application, making this technology widely available for research and clinical applications.

Many devices such as vacuum grippers, Gecko adhesive grippers and electrostatic adhesion grippers need contact with a flat area. However, this makes attaching to irregular surfaces difficult. Curved surfaces can be viewed as locally flat in a small enough area. Having a surface that would conform in small patches or areas to an object would aid in grasping an irregularly shaped object. Such a device would allow a wide variety of adhesion-based methods to work more efficiently by having the gripper conform to the object. The solution is a novel gripper for irregular surfaces. The solution places adhesion surfaces at the end of a two-dimensional surface connected to self-balancing mechanisms. These mechanisms can be combinations of 1D or 2D self-balancing and self-similar structures. By placing adhesion surfaces at the end of a fractal structure of balancing units, the system can have high adhesion to complex surfaces. Many adhesion devices benefit from having highly aligned contact areas with an object. These adhesion surfaces can be suction cups, gecko adhesion material, or electrostatics. The main element of the structure is a 2D initial surface that can take loadings from the contact with the object to change its configuration and self-balance the forces across one or more dimensions to maximize contact area normal to the surface. These structures need not be perfectly fractal or as they may have parameters that vary across interaction of the scale of the mechanism, such as the orientation, aspect ratio or scaled spacing between components. Current gripper solutions suffer from the inability to maintain attachment with irregular surfaces. This system will enable attachment to irregular surfaces.",

Demineralization indicators can be quantified using laser-induced autofluorescence which is a reliable, safe, and low-cost alternative to the current inconsistent X-ray and visual inspections. Optical imaging is used for early detection of this enamel decay process, allowing for intervention before a cavity is formed. Laser-induced autofluorescence (AF) from multiple excitation wavelengths is induced in enamel. The relative intensities of the AF emission when the enamel changes from healthy to demineralized. This can be quantified and serve as an indicator of early-stage enamel demineralization. This can be used in conjunction with a scanning fiber endoscope to provide a reliable, safe and low-cost means for identifying dental caries or decays. A cavity can be seen on X-ray and often by eye by a dentist. X-ray and visual inspection often lack the sensitivity to detect lesions at an early enough stage where remineralization is possible. In addition, repetitive monitoring of suspected demineralization by X-ray imaging may be not safe to use for children. Other detection means such as using ultrasound technologies may lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity and are bulky and expensive. This technology is a reliable, non-invasive, and cost-effective means for identifying areas at risk of forming a cavity.

This method allows for improved navigational accuracy using thin, circumferential blades supported by a hollow sheath and actuated by a helical plunger. The solution is a novel biopsy tool design that overcomes the drawbacks associated with the current methods for the bile duct biopsy procedure. The biopsy tool consists of thin, circumferential blades supported by a hollow sheath and actuated by a helical plunger. Once a constriction or suspicious region is located, the tool is deployed to form a cutting annulus capable of uniformly collecting tissue samples around the circumference of the duct. It is actuated by pulling a metal braided cable sleeve to contact the plunger and compress and twist the tool along its axis. This causes the blades to buckle laterally, which deploys them outward and presses them into the ductal tissue. The deployed tool is pulled by both the cable sleeve and support sheath to cut the constricted ductal tissue section. After cutting, the cable sleeve is released to allow the elastic blades to close and trap tissue within them. Once the procedure is completed, the biopsy tool is retracted into an optional sheath for tissue analysis by a pathologist. The most common biopsy method in the bile duct is brush sampling of cells for cytology. However, the sensitivity of standard biliary brushings has historically been low, around 30%-60%. It has been suggested that the low sensitivity of brush cytology is mainly due to inadequate cellular sampling. With this solution, epithelial to deeper submucosal tissues can be obtained for proper tissue diagnosis, as well as a sufficient amount of sample to perform an accurate analysis.

Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry is a widespread tool for the characterization of protein stability and mapping protein interactions and is becoming more widely used for biotherapeutic development. One of the major drawbacks to this method is the high day-to-day variation of results leading to low reproducibility. Currently available internal exchange reporters designed to reduce variation between runs are limited in that they only function within a narrow temporal window and can exhibit complex solution dependent exchange behavior. The solution is a collection of highly stable internal exchange reporter (IER) compounds that exhibit predictable exchange behavior under a wide range of reaction conditions.

The competitive advantage of this innovation lies in its potential to significantly improve the reproducibility of Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange studies. Unlike currently available internal exchange reporters, these compounds exhibit predictable exchange behavior across various conditions and can be modified to exchange over a broader temporal window, leading to greater reproducibility and more accurate results.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "When brain cell DNA is damaged by disease, the cell's attempts to repair the DNA can dry up crucial resources needed to maintain the cell's energy, eventually leading to cell death. This technology aims to replenish these resources by using cost-effective, highly customizable nanopeptoids to deliver building blocks for the needed resources and achieve the first effective method for targeted energy regeneration in the brain. This both aids the repair of DNA and helps to prevent cell death.\n\nOver 20% of the oxygen we breathe is used in the brain to produce energy for cells to use. When that process is impaired by DNA damage from neurological diseases, brain cells suffer from the lack of energy and eventually die. The root cause can be traced back to a depletion of NAD+, a vital chemical in the processes of both energy production and DNA repair.\n\nNormally, NAD+ is used inside cells in a cycle converting oxygen into useable energy. However, when a disease damages the DNA inside a cell, the cell responds by producing a different molecule acting as a \"first responder\" to repair DNA. This process uses up NAD+, resulting in the lack of energy production, and eventually leads to cell death.\n\nReplenishing NAD+ levels within a cell in case of DNA damage is challenging; it cannot be directly passed into a cell, and its production from precursors such as NAM is still not well understood. While nanomaterial-based drug delivery platforms have shown great promise, designing and manufacturing nanoparticles to carry NAD+ or NAM into damaged cells has not yet been demonstrated. There is therefore an unmet need in the targeted restoration of cell energy inside the brain.\n\nIn order to replenish energy specifically to cells suffering from DNA damage, this technology uses nanoscale peptoids as a platform to deliver NAD+ or NAM. Peptoids are a highly customizable class of molecules, capable of being manipulated into various shapes and sizes, and have been used to reach hard-to-target organs such as the brain.\n\nThe use of this therapy would prevent the root cause of this form of cell death, and aid in repairing damaged DNA. In addition, this technology aims to provide fundamental understanding into targeted drug delivery to injured brain cells, and treatment of energy depletion-induced cell death.\n\nPeptoid nanoparticles are both more economical and more effective as a drug delivery platform for this use case than other nanomaterials studied in literature. They are easy to manufacture and customize, with a variety of shapes and molecular structures that can be tuned to various drug molecules. In the present study, the stability of peptoids in a nanotube shape helps to prevent premature release of the intended drug.\n\nThe direct impact of the technology aims at underserved patient populations, namely victims of neonatal and pediatric brain disease. In addition, fundamental research has the potential to go beyond the brain. Through understanding nanopeptoid delivery of NAD+ precursors and the subsequent role of those precursors in restoring energy levels within a cell, this can be extended to other energy depletion conditions such as COVID-19.",

Suture anchors are critical in attaching soft tissues to boney structures in various joints during orthopedic surgeries. However, the installation process of suture anchors often requires the use of drill guides, which can lead to increased trauma to healthy tissues due to the need to repeatedly replace the guide via the same small portal. This problem is particularly concerning for patients with fragile bones or osteoporosis and can result in extended surgical time and compromised surgical outcomes. The innovative solution is a specially engineered orthopedic drill guide designed to minimize tissue trauma during suture anchor installation. The guide and drill feature a reduced diameter, and the sharp obturator used for insertion is cannulated, allowing it to be placed over a Nitinol flexible guide wire. This technology reduces the disruption of surrounding healthy tissue and offers potential benefits in terms of improved surgical outcomes and decreased surgical time. The competitive advantage of this innovative orthopedic drill guide lies in its ability to address the unmet need for a less invasive suture anchor installation process.

This aspect is particularly important for patient populations prone to fragile bones or osteoporosis, as well as surgeries where reduced surgical time is crucial. By minimizing tissue trauma, it can lead to overall cost savings through improved surgical outcomes and shortened surgical time.

This device allows for a more efficient operation of digital load to perform quicker computations than the existing digital systems with a first control loop and second control loop operating independently.\n\nSome synchronous digital systems have a first control loop and a second control loop that operate independently. The first control loop can control a supply voltage such that the supply voltage tracks a reference voltage. The supply voltage typically powers a digital load such as a microprocessor. The second control loop controls a clock signal such that a frequency of the clock signal tracks a frequency of a reference clock signal. The clock signal is typically provided to the digital load for timing purposes. At times, the supply voltage can undesirably drift from the reference voltage. For example, a decreased supply voltage can cause the digital load to require more time to perform a given computation. Meanwhile, the clock signal frequency is typically unaffected by this change in the supply voltage. If the supply voltage decreases enough, timing errors can occur.\n\nImproved circuits with methods for regulating a clock signal and a supply voltage are needed. This is achieved with an all-digital unified clock and power architecture that combines switched-capacitor-based voltage control and clock frequency regulation into a single loop to significantly reduce required guardbands.\n\nCorrectly operating digital SoC domains at their target frequencies require the addition of supply voltage guardbands to account for supply droop events and temperature variation. These guardbands degrade processor energy efficiency, especially in low-voltage sensor and IoT applications due to increased delay sensitivity to temperature and supply voltage variation.

    "ip_number": "BDP 8476",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The innovation is a library preparation technique that produces an error-corrected nucleic acid library for sequencing. Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) revolutionized the field of genomics and personalized medicine and has been used to scalably identify disease-relevant mutations. However, existing sequencing technologies are limited in application by a relatively high error rate, making it difficult to identify low-prevalence mutations. Duplex sequencing uses degenerate unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to label library fragments, followed by redundant sequencing of each fragment at high depth to produce an error-corrected consensus. Since UMI-mediated approaches require an excessive number of sequencing reads in order to identify mutations, they are limited in scalability and cost-prohibitive for many applications. Thus there is a need for fast, inexpensive, and accurate sequencing approaches that leverage the power of NGS. The solution is a library preparation technique that produces an error-corrected nucleic acid library for sequencing. The method is developed for the Omniome sequencer but is generalizable to other high fidelity next generation sequencers. Linked duplex sequencing is a novel experimental framework wherein two strands of DNA are covalently joined from an initial template fragment by a linker adapter. The resulting duplex provides a single molecule template for sequencing, such that error correction of the duplex can be performed comparing the two linked strands and only variation observed in both are accepted as true mutations. A UMI can be optionally incorporated when interrogating molecules mapping to the same genomic location or to allow more robust elimination of PCR duplicates from randomly sheared DNA. The competitive advantage of this technology lies in its ability to provide increased NGS read fidelity so that it does not require excessive read depth. The strategy presented here has the advantages of scalability, cost-effectiveness, ease of use, efficiency, and sensitivity. Due to its higher accuracy and lower error rates, this method can be used to detect low-prevalence mutations, thus greatly advancing sequencing capabilities in the genomics field. As the global DNA sequencing market size is valued at $8.9 billion in 2022 with an expected CAGR of 20.7%, there is a significant opportunity for this technology to advance the field of sequencing technologies.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a teleoperated bladder scanning robot to perform cystoscopies in rural settings. This system is a soft balloon-like tube pressurized and placed into the urethra to allow endoscope travel to the bladder opening. Bladder cancer requires ongoing screenings in order to identify recurrence in time for effective removal. These bladder scans, called cystoscopies, are performed by trained urologists in hospitals using rigid or flexible endoscopes inserted into the urethra. Multiple scopes may be used in order to ensure total screening coverage of the inside of the bladder. This insertion and movement within the bladder is often painful and uncomfortable, which, in addition to other factors, can lead to patients going further between cystoscopy procedures or stopping them altogether. This presents significant risk to the patient, as bladder cancer can be specifically aggressive if not caught early. Regionalization of bladder cancer care has steadily increased over the past few decades, resulting in the majority of bladder cancer care occurring in urban centers. Even though a cystoscopy is a procedure that all urologists can perform outside of specialty centers, the changing demographics of urologic practices has made access to this procedure difficult for patients living in rural areas. Therefore, an improved system and methods of use that enable the use of a teleoperated robot to perform cystoscopies in rural settings may be desirable. The solution is a bladder scanning robot that can be teleoperated by remote experts and set up by nurses. A soft balloon-like tube is pressurized and allowed to evert (roll from the inside) into the urethra in order to act as a protective sheath for a flexible endoscope to gently travel through. The endoscope can provide feedback about the tube insertion as it everts along the urethra without sliding or the endoscope can be inserted after the tube has reached the opening of the bladder. Once inside the bladder, the flexible endoscope is controlled by the doctor or autonomously to inspect the inside 3D surface of the bladder. Other associated technologies may be attached to or inserted through the endoscope to provide interventional capabilities in order to further diagnose or treat abnormalities found in the initial scan. Any of these functions could be performed manually, autonomously, or via teleoperation. Existing solutions cause discomfort and are regionalized in urban centers, making access to care difficult for all. Performing cystoscopies in rural clinics will minimize the travel burden on patients, lower travel reimbursements for single-payer health systems, and free up clinical space and resources at urban hospitals.",

    "ip_description": "Polymers and composites are crucial materials for automotive and aerospace manufacturing but require new methods to weld them to other materials. Through the use of RF heating, energy can be efficiently targeted to heat up the desired weld. The technology uses a closed-loop system with high automation, controlling the heating power through onboard sensor data for consistent welds.\n\nRadio frequency (RF) heating uses high-frequency RF waves to heat carbon materials such as graphite, while leaving all others untouched. The technology coats RF-sensitive graphitic susceptors along the desired weld, which heat up to high temperature upon application of an RF field. This allows the heating energy to be targeted only where it is wanted, and then to safely dissipate into the surrounding material.\n\nThe technology takes this concept further and incorporates a closed-loop approach to controlling the RF system during welding. The materials are held together with an applied pressure and monitored by a thermal camera. Feedback from the pressure and temperature sensors are used to control the RF heating system, resulting in consistent welds every time. This approach allows the system to be flexible to working with different materials, while maintaining a high degree of automation.\n\nThis technology takes the recent advancement of RF heating of carbon materials and applies it to a much-needed area in advanced manufacturing. RF heating is an energy-efficient welding method for various polymers and composites, requiring no oven and leaving no artifacts as would be seen in other welding methods. The method was demonstrated to weld samples at a power of only 50 Watts in 2 minutes. This energy efficiency is thanks to the improved penetration depth and selectivity of RF waves, as opposed to commonly used microwaves. Finally, the closed-loop control scheme allows the entire process to be highly automated, and thus scalable for manufacturing purposes.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The manipulation of quantum properties of electrons to store information has been used for decades, and its continued study is key to the development of new fields such as spintronics and quantum computing. The discovery of strain-induced properties of stacked CrSBr layers promises advances in both unparalleled control of key material properties, as well as energy efficiency, in the development of new information storage components.\n\nMagnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are one of the most important computer components that rely on the quantum properties of electrons. They are made up of two magnetic materials, separated by an insulator through which electrons tunnel between. The magnetization of the materials can either be parallel (P) or anti-parallel (AP), which acts as a switch to control the flow of electrons passing through. MTJs are not only used in today's computers as magnetic random-access memory but are a crucial technology in spintronics, a key field in the development of quantum computing.\n\nSwitching between P and AP states (1 and 0 states, as a conventional bit) requires input energy equal to the energy difference between the states. A large energy difference as seen in thick MTJs results in a conventional bit; the stored state is stable and will not change unless actively switched by a new input. A small energy difference however, as seen in thin MTJs, results in a system varying between P and AP states. This \"probabilistic\" bit (p-bit) is of great interest in developing fields such as neuromorphic computing.\n\nConventionally, this energy difference is fixed by the thickness of the materials. In addition, this transition from P to AP states requires the application of large currents or magnetic fields. There is still an unmet need for energy efficient MTJs beyond these standard mechanics, as well as MTJs that can act as either a conventional or probabilistic bit.\n\nThe technology applies strain to stacked layers of CrSBr on a flexible substrate to change the magnetization state without applied current or magnetic field. Without any strain, the CrSBr layers exhibit an AP state, disallowing electron flow. However, when strained, this AP state transitions to a parallel P state, functioning as a conventional bit by controlling only strain. This lack of magnetic field or current application makes this bit much more energy efficient to use.\n\nApplied strain can also be used to set the MTJ to work as either a conventional bit or a probabilistic bit. At an intermediate level of strain, the energy difference between the P and AP states is pulled closer together so that the states swap randomly back and forth, functioning as a probabilistic bit. This technology realizes a truly programmable bit, whose operation can be made to be conventional or probabilistic, all while relying only on applied strain.\n\nThe two major advantages of this technology are its energy efficiency, and the unprecedented level of control over the magnetic states. The energy efficiency comes from the fact that little to no current is needed to apply the strain. At the same time, the piezoelectric system that applies the strain is capable of incredible levels of precision resulting in fine control over the resulting states. This opens the door to operation of the MTJ as either a conventional or probabilistic bit, with the capability of being extended to creating quantum bits by attaching superconducting leads. The material itself also offers useful properties, such as being able to operate at relatively high temperatures up to 150 K and remain stable when exposed to air.",

    "ip_description": "This technology offers innovative polypeptides that bind with high affinity to influenza hemagglutinin, offering potential applications in treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of influenza. Influenza remains a significant global health challenge, causing seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. Current vaccines and treatments often struggle with the virus\u2019s rapid mutation, leading to reduced efficacy. As a result, there is a need for general or quickly adaptable solutions to protect against newly emerging influenza viruses. Influenza\u2019s main surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), is an attractive therapeutic target. While broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting HA have been developed, they are typically administered through the intravenous route and fail to effectively protect against contemporary strains of influenza. The technology involves designed polypeptides that specifically bind with high affinity to the HA protein on the surface of the influenza virus. By targeting the HA protein, which plays a crucial role in the virus\u2019s ability to infect host cells, these protein binders can neutralize a broad range of influenza strains. These polypeptides are engineered to target the conserved receptor binding site, thereby neutralizing the virus and preventing it from entering host cells. Further, the mucosal delivery of these protein binders results in the most effective therapeutic protection against contemporary strains of influenza. This approach can potentially overcome the limitations of current vaccines and treatments, providing a more robust defense against influenza. High Affinity and Selectivity: The designed protein binders exhibit strong binding to the influenza HA, ensuring effective neutralization. Broad Spectrum Neutralization: By targeting conserved regions of the hemagglutinin, this innovation provides broad protection against various influenza strains. Effective Mucosal Delivery: This technology could be developed as an easy to administer inhaler and marketed as a novel therapeutic against influenza. Ease of Production: The small size and stability of these proteins simplify their production and administration compared to traditional monoclonal antibodies.

Hydrated vanadium pentoxide is a promising cathode for aqueous zinc ion batteries because of the high specific capacity as high as 400 mAh/g. However, it suffers from structural degradation and self-discharge. Currently, alkali and alkaline cations are introduced into the interplanar of vanadium pentoxide to expand the lattice spacing to enhance the reaction kinetics and improve the rate capability and cycling stability. A conductive component like graphene is also used to enhance electrical conductivity.

The system gains its mechanical properties by wrapping a repeated geometric tiling to create a hollow cylinder. The solution is a hollow, extendable, and flexible driveshaft. This structure gains its mechanical properties by wrapping a repeated geometric tiling to create a hollow cylinder. A series of compliant linkages make a single unit cell with specifically constrained multi-degree of freedom (DOF) movement with the Watt\u2019s mechanism making up the base unit cell. Tiling this unit cell around a cylinder creates a structure with low resistance to extension and a high resistance to torsion.

    "ip_description": "This technology offers a method to process intact core biopsies or large tissue biospecimens for 3D imaging. A microfluidic device flows formalin fluid in an enclosed chamber to completely fix the tissue and allow high throughput processing at a faster rate. To determine a diagnosis for various diseases, pathologists typically obtain biopsies from patients, which are first processed in large-scale pathology laboratories and then assessed after specimens are observed in two-dimensions (2D) through a microscope using white light. Thinly sectioned 2D core biopsies, which are chunks of biological tissue, contain the most information that best represents the in vivo condition of a disease state. However, 2D slides are inherently distorted and disorienting when observed by pathologists, hence significant tissue architectural information is lost. Three-dimensional (3D) imaging aids pathologists by providing an even more complete picture of the disease state, which promotes rapid on site evaluation and enhances diagnostic accuracy. However, manual handling of bulk biological tissue samples required for 3D imaging is difficult due to tissue viscoelasticity. Consequently, fixing, staining, and optical clearing of such biological tissue samples is inherently time intensive. These factors have been raised by clinicians as major limitations for the rapid processing and throughput of intact, 3D biological tissue samples to be used for diagnosis and study. Therefore, a fluidic device and methods of use for processing such 3D biological tissue samples for pathology may be desirable. In order to process intact core biopsies, or large tissue biospecimens for 3D imaging, a microfluidic device was developed to accept tissue cores directly procured from the patient via coring needles. A key procedure prior to the deposition of the core biopsy into the device is the attachment of a formalin-filled syringe to the coring needle. In this fashion, the fixative is continuously diffusing into the tissue while the coring needle's contents are gently positioned into the initial stage of the microfluidic device using formalin fluid flow. If tissue is incompletely fixed, specimens are exposed to microwave (or other radiation), or mechanical sonication, to encourage diffusion of fixative while the tissue remains within an enclosed chamber. A one-way septum provides a sealed interface between the microfluidics device and the coring needle, and thus prevents backflow, or leakage. This all promotes human-free handling of the core biopsy; by preventing exposure to the human environment, tissue cores can also be processed without fixation. Through this method, diagnostic versatility is expanded since biomarkers for various diseases may be employed with molecular specificity. Existing 2D approaches provide a distorted image that takes a significant amount of time to prepare. Existing 3D approaches are limited by the current lack of rapid processing and throughput. This method provides high throughput and processing of 3D tissues samples, which can provide more data at a faster rate than existing solutions.",

The incorporation of affordable and naturally sourced tannic acid (TA) in hydrogels can tune the swelling behavior and mechanical properties for 3D printing.\n\nA major barrier to the advancement of tissue engineering and bioprinting is the lack of available materials designed for these fields. Hydrogels, the most used class of materials for these fields, are limited due to their complex preparation and their poor range of mechanical properties. Therefore, the development of facile strategies to tune the mechanical properties of hydrogels to fit a given application is of utmost importance.\n\nAffordable and naturally sourced tannic acid (TA) can be used to tune the swelling behavior and mechanical properties of 3D printed methacrylated bovine serum albumin (MA-BSA) hydrogels. Depending on the concentration of TA in solution and the post-print processing conditions, the degree of swelling can be tuned to as low as 13% up to 245%. Under the same processing conditions, the compressive strength of fully hydrated constructs was demonstrated to be as low as 0.8 MPa and as high as 104 MPa. Additionally, the hydrogels showed a similarly broad range in toughness, possibly enabling suturability.\n\nExisting hydrogel production is time intensive, inconsistent, and yields poor mechanical properties, limiting the adoption of the technology. This simple technology can allow for consistent and rapid production coupled with a very broad range of mechanical properties, allowing one to tailor the mechanical properties for each specific application. The competitive advantage is rapid hydrogel production that yields consistent and tunable mechanical properties with suitability to a variety of applications.",

    "ip_description": "HemoLens is a non-contact optical screening method for the detection of fecal occult blood in stool samples. The presence of fecal occult blood can be a sign of a number of serious conditions, from colorectal cancer to inflammatory bowel diseases and chronic anemia. Through advanced data collection and processing algorithms, HemoLens uses nothing but a smartphone and external LED to achieve sensitivities comparable to some laboratory methods, showing promise for broadening the availability of these crucial screenings.\n\nColorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, making early screening and detection of crucial importance. This can be done through a colonoscopy for best results; however, the high cost and invasive nature of the procedure leads to nearly 50% of patients referred to colonoscopy screenings failing to follow through. Lab-based screenings are done through the detection of fecal occult blood in stool samples, through tests such as fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) and guaiac testing for fecal occult blood (gFOBT). Fecal occult blood presence found through these screenings can not only help detect colorectal cancers but are also associated with other serious conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases and chronic anemia.\n\nWhile more accessible than a colonoscopy, these laboratory methods still present issues. Patients must physically collect, package, and transport stool samples to labs for testing. Each step of this detracts from the number of patients following through. Therefore, if these requirements could be circumvented through an at-home, non-contact and accessible method for fecal occult blood screening, significant progress could be made in getting screening for millions worldwide who would benefit from it.\n\nHemoLens is a non-contact optical method for detecting occult blood in stool samples, consisting of a smartphone and an external LED light to achieve detection rates comparable to gFOBT laboratory testing. Its algorithm is the heart of the innovation, using spectral imaging to correct for various background conditions to arrive at a quantitative result. Depending on the reflectance characteristics measured, the algorithm determines a \"blood score\" which is mapped to the content of fecal occult blood within the sample. This screening test can be done without handling the sample or sending it to a laboratory and can therefore be conducted as often as every bowel movement of a particular patient.\n\nHemoLens offers greater convenience, availability, and frequency of use along with quantitative detection comparable to some laboratory studies. HemoLens offers results 100 times more sensitive than can be detected visually, on par with the sensitivity of the gFOBT laboratory method. While HemoLens is not meant to replace very high sensitivity methods such as colonoscopies or FIT testing, the ease of use and non-contact nature of the screening can only serve to help get screening to more patients who need it.\n\nHemoLens, unlike other optical approaches to detecting fecal occult blood, has a unique advanced algorithm for data collection and processing. Through proprietary spectral imaging methods, the device is capable of estimating quantitative measures of fecal occult blood instead of qualitative estimations offered by other methods.\n\nCustomer discovery has shown substantial interest in HemoLens. Screening patients prefer it to colonoscopies, and patients routinely monitoring their own health (especially colon cancer survivors) would prefer it due to screening frequency possible with this tool. Health professionals also see opportunity as an adjunct test to colonoscopies or between annual FIT tests particularly among more anxious patients, and among patients averse to invasive colonoscopies or physically manipulating their stool. These above advantages put HemoLens in an excellent position to increase screening rates worldwide, combatting some of the leading causes of death.",

Custom nozzles extrude and cure the hydrogel during the printing process and shows potential in in vitro models. Tubular structures are abundant in nature where they function broadly as conduits for the bulk transport of fluids. These tubular structures include the airways and blood vessels of vertebrates. Fabrication of perfusable structures using biofunctional materials and compatible manufacturing processes is of great interest in the areas of bioengineering and regenerative medicine. While tubes are geometrically simple, their fabrication from soft materials is an existing challenge in the field. Existing approaches exhibit limited utility when it comes to the fabrication of tubes with small luminal diameters. Improved methods for fabricating polymeric tubes and associated biomimetics are needed. The solution is a novel process for fabricating coaxial fibers and hollow tubes with hydrogel compositions. This is enabled by the development of custom nozzles for extrusion-based printing, which is coupled with hydrogel inks which can be modified to tune the physical and chemical properties of the corresponding hydrogel. The nozzle assembly extrudes a hydrogel solution, which is cured during the extrusion process, forming hollow tubes or filaments. The hydrogel tubes have potential for use as artificial blood vessels, in vitro lung models, or other applications related to cell culturing or tissue engineering. Common existing strategies involve casting or rolling a synthetic or natural polymeric material around a mandrel, wherein the diameter of the mandrel determines the tube's luminal diameter. Mandrel-based approaches can yield tubes with properties comparable to those of human blood vessels. However, the utility of these approaches is limited when it comes to the fabrication of tubes with small luminal diameters (<0.5 mm). 3D printing will allow for tunable and consistent hydrogel tubes that exhibit biomimetic properties.

This system can quickly gather data, process its quality and stability, and automatically generate alarms. Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) has demonstrated a wide range of competitive advantages over conventional manufacturing methods in terms of customizable parts with intricate internal features, complex external geometries, and a broad range of materials. The process has also shown the potential of producing parts with lighter weights and reduced components. Despite such capabilities and countless emerging applications, limited reliability and reproducibility are hindering broader adoption of this manufacturing technology. LPBF is sensitive to disturbances and input process parameters such as laser powers, laser scan paths, and scan speeds. Unpredictable process variations can result in various part defects, including porosity, balling, high surface roughness, thermal cracking, geometric error, microstructural inhomogeneities, impurities, etc. The same part can come out differently from different machines or even from the same machine on another day. As a result, tremendous human efforts are involved in the loop to inspect the parts to find defects and assure quality after the printing, especially in such industries as medical devices and aviation. This solution is in-situ imaging and data analytics for coaxial monitoring of LPDF. This is an efficient data processing framework for the coaxial process monitoring module with a visual camera.

Specifically, this invention eliminates various noises in the raw data, isolates the area that interacts with the power source from the unmolten powder bed, and extracts important features that reflect the evolution of the melting pool, laser-material interaction characteristics, and potential process imperfections in LPBF. Despite emerging research and development efforts related to these topics, state-of-the-art results are still far from the maturity reached in other manufacturing applications.

    "ip_name": "Input Driven Self-Clocked Dynamic Comparator",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "This technology offers a method to reduce the switching power for a dynamic comparator. It uses an input driven self-clocking mechanism instead of a constant clock that can consume less dynamic power and run faster. Ultra-low power sensor networks have been a topic of prevailing research over the last few years. These networks can be used in a wide range of applications \u2013 biomedical, security, autonomous navigation and Time of Flight Imaging. All these applications require highly power efficient Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to digitize the sensed signals. A key building block in virtually all converter architectures and mixed-signal electronics is a comparator, which contributes the majority of the energy consumption. For example, 50-60 % of the energy consumption in a Successive approximation register (SAR) ADC comes from the comparator. With technology scaling, this problem becomes more acute because the low voltage operation imposes stringent requirements on the quantization noise of the comparator. The most common comparator architecture used in converters is the StrongARM latch, owing to their strong positive feedback required for fast decisions, zero static power consumption, and full swing outputs. The power consumed by the latch arises primarily from the charging and discharging of the capacitances. Several methods have been proposed to reduce this switching power. Most of these techniques attempt to reduce the signal swings across the nodes. The solution is a novel way to reduce the switching power for a dynamic comparator by using an input driven self-clocking mechanism. A dynamic comparator is operated using an external clock. Because of the switching states of the clock, there is continuous charging and discharging of the capacitance irrespective of the voltage difference at the input (VIN \u2013 VREF). But if the clock is enabled when the voltage difference is less than a certain voltage (|VIN-VREF|<\u0394v) and disabled otherwise, the switching activity can be reduced, as shown in. This method accomplishes this using a pre-amplifier stage and a feedback loop around the comparator which causes it to oscillate. The oscillation stops when VIN>VREF on the rising edge and VIN. Traditional analog-to-digital converters are difficult to operate at such high sampling speeds because of their high-power consumption. The main contribution to the power consumption comes from the comparator which does not scale in the same order with supply voltage and technology as for the other digital blocks. In addition to their high dynamic power dissipation, it is difficult to have a robust clock generation scheme at such a high speed. This solution is a novel self-clocked dynamic comparator architecture which can run faster and consume less dynamic power without an external clock.",

    "ip_description": "LabintheWildTM is a platform for diversifying participation in research for psychology, human-computer interactions and related fields outside of demographics that, while convenient, are often not representative of the global human population. By designing online studies that advertise the opportunity to compare your results to others, intrinsic motivation can replace compensation, leading to participation from over 200 countries and 5 million cumulative study responses without sacrificing the quality of data. In an era reliant on data-driven insights, tools like LabintheWild play a crucial role in understanding human behavior.\n\nResearch in fields such as psychology, human-computer interaction, and behavioral economics relies heavily on human test subjects. However, a critical assumption underlying these studies-that these participants represent the entire human population- has a significant flaw. Most of these studies recruit participants out of convenience; that is, ones easily accessible around college campuses. This results in survey demographics predominantly comprised of WEIRD participants (White, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic), that are unfortunately among the least representative demographics for the broader human population.\n\nTo conduct higher quality research, it is therefore essential to reach broader audiences. The internet provides an amazing opportunity for this kind of reach, but using it presents challenges. Existing online platforms for survey data collection such as Mechanical Turk often function by offering compensation to internet users for completed studies. While this is a step in the right direction, the reliability of the data and the diversity of the sample participants still falls short of the desired threshold. Users often prioritize minimizing time spent on a study, leading to potentially unreliable responses. Additionally, the requirement for users to sign up and receive payment in specific currencies limits the global viability of such tools.\n\nLabintheWild (accessible at www.labinthewild.org) represents a decade-long effort to attract a truly diverse range of participants\u2014beyond the WEIRD subset\u2014to engage in various studies. The platform\u2019s success lies in its deliberate removal of participation barriers and the inherently motivating design of its studies.\n\nThe studies on LabintheWild provide personalized feedback to participants. Participants can compare their results to existing data, fostering curiosity about self-perception and performance relative to others. Everyday internet users willingly participate in unsupervised, uncompensated surveys due to this intrinsic motivation. Thanks to this intrinsic motivation, LabintheWild can remove many of the barriers facing foreign internet study participants. Participants can engage directly without any registration process. Currency restrictions are also lifted, allowing foreign participants to contribute without needing specific payment methods.\n\nLabintheWild distinguishes itself not only through its innovative approach, but a robust track record spanning over ten years. Over its first decade of operation, LabintheWild facilitated completion of 5 million surveys, with an average of 1000 clicks per day. Participants spanned over 200 countries and six continents, with ages ranging from minors to 95 years old. In addition to this increase in participant diversity, thanks to intrinsically motivating study design the unsupervised data collected was also on-par with laboratory-collected survey data. The success of the platform was so abundant, that requests from external researchers to add their studies to LabintheWild come once or twice a week.\n\nThrough leveraging human curiosity, LabintheWild removes entry barriers and naturally proliferates through social media across national, socioeconomic, and generational borders. By emphasizing a non-WEIRD, diverse participant selection, it ensures data truly representative of human behavior. In this increasingly data-driven world with various AI tools requiring training data, it is essential platforms like LabintheWild exist to provide data truly representative of what it means to be human.",

This method allows for controlled delivery and testing of different reagents to reduce cytotoxicity testing. Pre-clinical animal tests fall short as predictors of efficacy, toxic doses, and drug metabolism later observed in human trials. If systems can be developed that accurately predict drug responses in humans, advances in drug treatment or prevention would be dramatically streamlined, and time frames for drug development shortened considerably. Functional assays can potentially complement and extend genomics-based approaches for personalized oncology, but need to be used on live tissue. An acute challenge in functional precision cancer medicine arises from the fact that dissociated cells are generally insufficient for the functional assays; to preserve the tumor microenvironment, these assays should be performed on intact tissue, whose availability is scarce. Tissue samples that are available suffer from inconsistent cutting techniques that limit the consistency of data generated from assay testing. The solution entails the dissection of tissue pieces into a mono-disperse distribution of sub-millimeter-size cuboidal shapes. This method relies on a motorized tissue slicer, which cuts equally sized cuboidal or cylindrical pieces. This method is more precise than current manual tissue cutting techniques. Size homogeneity of these tissue fragments is crucial for biological studies and microfluidic technologies. This is combined with a microfluidic platform that allows for high-throughput screening in a standard multi-well platform assembled atop the microfluidic device. The platform enables culture in arrays without significant diffusion or communication between them and allows for controlled delivery and testing of different reagents.

    "ip_description": "The innovation is a method that involves reprogramming the epigenetic environment in the vicinity of a target site to modulate prime editing efficiency. Prime editing, a CRISPR-based genome engineering tool, facilitates the precise introduction of genetic variants in the genome. However, prime editing faces challenges such as suboptimal efficiency and variable editing outcomes which limits its widespread adoption in basic research and clinical settings. As a result, understanding the epigenetic regulation of prime editing is crucial for improving its efficacy and expanding the therapeutic potential of this promising genome editing tool. The solution is a method that involves reprogramming the epigenetic environment in the vicinity of a target site to modulate prime editing efficiency. Prime editing efficiency of a desired target can be modulated by regulating the transcriptional activity of the nearby gene. For example, if the desired site is targeted with CRISPRa, which activates gene expression, prime editing efficiency is increased at that site. If the desired site is targeted with CRISPRi, which inhibits gene expression, prime editing efficiency is decreased at that site. The competitive advantage of this technology lies in its ability to increase the efficiency of prime editing, thus expanding the therapeutic applications of prime editing. Coupling epigenetic reprogramming with prime editing demonstrates that transient gene activation before prime editing can enhance editing efficiency. This strategy will advance stem-cell based gene therapies, in which the target gene remains transcriptionally silenced and is only expressed in differentiated cell types. As the global genome editing market size is valued at $6.4 billion in 202 with an expected CAGR of 17.8%, there is a significant opportunity for this technology to advance the field of gene therapy and genetic engineering.",

The nano-actuators magnetically is propelled to target cells and oscillate for mechanical damage of the cells. The solutions are nano-actuators and methods used to initiate such apoptosis to remove cancer cells. The nano-actuators include a ferromagnetic head and a compliant helical portion extending from the head formed in part from a ferromagnetic shape memory alloy. This is configured to be elastically compressible with an external magnetic field, and to expand when the magnetic field is removed. A thin biocompatible external layer provides a platform for attaching a ligand that is selected to bind with a target cell type, for example, a target cancer cell. The nano-actuators are magnetically propelled to the target cells and oscillated to mechanically damage the target cells to induce apoptosis. As an option to the surgical removal of malignant cells, modern medical advances have developed treatments, such as chemical and radiation treatments, that are designed to induce in situ programmed cell death in malignant cells. These approaches introduce unwanted collateral health effects. This solution provides a treatment that does not require irradiation or poisoning of the body (or reduces the amount of irradiation or poisoning) thereby avoiding or mitigating unwanted collateral health effects that may be caused by such treatments, improving patient outcomes and quality of care.",

The nanoparticles are bonded and exhibit electronic communication with over 10% efficiency. Halide perovskites are used in optoelectronics, such as solar cells and light emitters. Research has shown that perovskite photovoltaic devices processed from solution inks can convert more than 22% of incident sunlight into electricity. This inexpensive processing method yields conversion rates at the top end of more costly silicon devices. However, the commercialization barrier for this technology is the instability of the semiconductor, which can dissociate into a volatile compound, posing the need for a new perovskite material that exhibits long term stability and durability. The technology is a composition of nanoparticles of 0-100nm on a surface of compatible material. Inorganic perovskite nanocrystals can be separated from precursors more efficiently using methyl acetate as a solvent. Unlike the bulk, the nanocrystals are stable at room temperature. A new surface treatment was developed which leads to conductive films enabling high efficiency photovoltaics and efficient electroluminescence. The surface material enables the nanoparticles to maintain crystallinity at temperatures between -180C and 150C, showing stability for months in ambient air. The nanoparticle is composed of either a metal chalcogenide, a group III-V material, a metal oxide, or a perovskite. These nanoparticles are in electronic communication with each other and are bonded in some form to the surface material, and exhibit over 10% efficiency. Current solutions for perovskites disassociate into volatile compounds and are not stable in certain environmental conditions. This technology outlines synthesis routes for perovskite films and nanoparticles, with a variety of modifications available to optimize certain parameters for different applications.

This neural co-processor can be used to create new artificial connections between different areas of the human brain or nervous system or create new artificial connections between the brain and muscles or other body organs. This could be done for the purposes of restoring lost function due to neurological disease or injury or augmenting natural capabilities. This is achieved by receiving neural signals from the nervous system of the individual and/or signals from an external sensor or information source. A stimulation pattern is generated based on the neural signals and/or external information sources, and a neural model, and the stimulation pattern is output to the nervous system of the individual. Stimulation of the nervous system based on the stimulation pattern computed by the neural model produces a measurable output by the individual.

    "ip_description": "This technology offers an automated system for core needle biopsy fixing. A milli-fluidic device formalin fixes the core needle biopsy which leads to consistent fixation for high throughput point-of-care monitoring and pathology. Core needle biopsy (CNB) is a common technique for obtaining tissue samples for aiding in diagnosis and therapeutic decisions for treating various conditions such as cancer. However, the evaluation of tissues obtained via CNB can be negatively impacted by inconsistent processing prior to evaluation. For example, tissues obtained via CNB are generally immersed in formalin soon after the biopsy to preserve the tissue. However, variations in the degree of formalin fixation of the tissue that occurs during this process can cause errors in subsequent analysis of the tissue. The solution is an automated system for core needle biopsy fixing. This is done with a modular milli-fluidic device for a non-contact and all-optical measure to determine full formalin fixation of a CNB. The system illuminates the biological sample that is within a container while a fixation process is performed, determines that the optical transmittance of the biological sample satisfies the requirements; and ceases the fixation process in response to determining that the optical transmittance of the biological sample satisfies the requirements. This is compatible with formalin as the fixation chemical but will also work for other methods that chemically cross-link organic material. Existing fixation techniques can lead to variation in the degree of formalin fixation, which leads to variability during testing, giving inconsistent data. This simple design can allow low-cost and high-throughput point-of-care monitoring that can speed up sample preparation and standardize testing and reduce variability in pathology.",

In addition, there is a need for novel therapeutics for hepato-intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), that can effectively minimize intestinal inflammation and provide better clinical management options for patients. The solution is the novel, murine-specific bile acid called omega muricholic acid (wMCA). Research has shown that wMCA can reduce intestinal inflammation in mice with IBD.

    "ip_description": "This technology is an automatic cord organizer and retractor that maintains sterility for multiple surgical operations. The device is self-contained and organized within a moveable cart to save physicians time and increase the quality of care with quick access to critical machines. Many surgical operations require multiple surgical devices (e.g., endoscopes, microdebriders, sonopets, coblators) attached to one or more surgical instruments or consoles via cables (e.g., power cables, fiber-optic cables, electrical cables, cords, tubes, hoses, conduits, wires). During an operation, surgical devices can be arranged near one another such that they are readily accessible to a doctor. As a result, however, cables attached to the devices can become tangled such that the use of one device may inadvertently cause one or more other unsecured devices to move, potentially falling onto the floor. The entanglement of cables can also inhibit quick access to such devices, which is often necessary during many surgical procedures. Accordingly, there exists a need for a system to organize surgical instruments and/or cables in a medical environment. The solution is an automatic cord organizer and retractor device that maintains sterility as it is self-contained. These are organized within a moveable cart, which maintains organization, and allows for the devices to be moved to their desired location without the risk of entanglement or devices falling to the floor.

The foot pedals are placed into a rack and remotely controlled during surgical procedure, eliminating cord entanglement and potentially life threatening delays during surgery.\n\nMost devices in the operating room are controlled by a foot pedal so that hands remain free. Each device is proprietary, and so each has a different pedal, cable, and electronic connection. Currently, multiple pedals of different sizes and shapes are used throughout an operation, so it can be difficult to rapidly locate the desired pedal. Often, a pedal is transferred from the surgeon to the assistant, who will use the pedal for a period and then transferred back to the primary surgeon. This inevitably creates tangles in the cords with other pedals. Often, a staff member will need to crawl under the operating room table to sort out the pedal situation because one cord is caught on something. This leads to unnecessary and potentially life-threatening delays during a surgical procedure.

The algorithms allow service bids from different companies, focus on profiles to fit resources, and more efficient energy management.\n\nElectric vehicles offer many benefits over traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles such as lower operating costs and the potential to run on locally produced renewable energy. However, mass adoption of EVs is not without its challenges; the public charging infrastructure is in its infancy. One proposed way to aid in addressing these challenges is vehicle-to-grid (V2G), the provision of energy and ancillary services from an EV to the electricity grid. Most studies have focused on bidirectional power flow for V2G, where there are serious challenges for its adoption. In order to pump energy back into the grid, additional hardware that is not currently included in EVs is required. Also, anti-islanding protection and other interconnection issues must be addressed. Additionally, there is increased cycling wear on the battery, and consumers may also be resistant to allowing the utility to pull energy from their batteries.\n\nThis innovation is optimal EV charging algorithms for unidirectional vehicle-to-grid (V2G). These algorithms are to be implemented by an aggregator which is a participant in energy markets. The aggregator communicates between the utility system and all of the participating EVs. Based on the battery state of charge of each EV, and the time that EVs will remain parked, the algorithms return the optimal charging profile for each EV as well as ancillary services bids from the aggregator to the energy market. The optimal charging profiles are those that maximize profits to the aggregators, utility system benefits, and customer economy. These algorithms can be adjusted to include optional system load and price level constraints which may be set by utilities and customers.\n\nAdditionally, mass unregulated charging of EVs can cause energy shortages in the power grid. With a potential solution of V2G bidirectional power flow, energy must be pumped back into the grid, which requires unavailable hardware and customers will likely be resistant to adopt this technique. These algorithms can provide a charging profile for each EV, allowing for service bids from different companies, allowing companies to focus on profiles that fit their resources, enabling more efficient energy management.",

    "ip_description": "A general, highly scalable algorithmic framework is proposed to synthesize a network topology and schedule optimized for a given collective operation run on a network. The approach tailors efficient designs for distributed systems, demonstrating significant performance benefits even for large-scale operations.\n\nIn the dynamic landscape of modern distributed computing and high performance computing (HPC), efficient communication among nodes within a cluster is critical. As advancing hardware has opened up network topology as a new way to optimize collective operations, this challenge becomes increasingly important when considering applications such as the training of machine learning (ML) models.\n\nHowever, existing network topologies do not use this variability and underutilize regular patterns of data flow during ML training. This results in falling short of achieving the optimal balance between latency and bandwidth. Moreover, the quest for optimal network topologies and corresponding communication schedules is highly complex; one that involves navigating a vast parameter space while considering the various tradeoffs. Bridging this gap requires innovative approaches that tailor network topologies specifically for a given network and collective communications operation, ensuring seamless data exchange while minimizing bottlenecks. The challenge lies not only in identifying efficient topologies but also in doing so in a reasonable time.\n\nThe software introduces a sophisticated and adaptable algorithmic framework designed to enhance collective communications within distributed networks. At its core, the solution aims to optimize both the network topology and communication schedule, leveraging scalable graph-theoretic approaches.\n\nTo address larger-scale scenarios, the software employs two essential tools: expansion techniques, and breadth-first broadcast (BFB) schedule generation. The first makes use of small-scale known optimal combinations of topologies and schedules and expands them in size and complexity to fit the requirement. The second makes use of known large-scale topologies from graph theory and generates a schedule for them in polynomial time.\n\nAfter using these two approaches to generate a list of viable options, the system explores the range of topology-schedule pairs using a searching algorithm. It identifies the most efficient combination tailored to the workload and compiles it down to the hardware level.\n\nThe technology offers several advantages over related work in the field of collective communications in direct-connect networks. While some methods rely on pre-defined network topologies, this algorithm synthesizes optimized topologies and schedules, addressing the limitations of traditional topologies. It optimizes both the topology and the associated schedule, ensuring seamless data exchange while minimizing latency. This holistic approach directly translates to improved system performance. Evaluations across various clusters and simulations demonstrate these tangible improvements, leading to a reduction in cost for running collective operations.",

The hernia belt is composed of a firm panel for abdomen support, dual self-balancing straps to wrap the body, and a panel rotation guided by cables. Over 1 million individuals in the USA are living with gastrointestinal stomas, and prevalence is increasing 3% annually as the national population\u2019s mean age increases. Patients who have undergone stoma formation surgery are at risk for parastomal hernias, a dangerous complication, which occurs in 80% of these individuals. Current hernia belt designs have limitations that result in disuse, such as adjustment complexity, donning difficulty, excess motion around the stoma, and discomfort. These issues could lead to decreased mechanical support leading to hernia formation and potentially skin excoriation. The solution is a simplified hernia belt. This design includes a firm panel, which transmits pressure onto the abdomen through a foam medium. Pressure applied around the stoma is controlled using a foam torus, which is a donut-shape material. This localizes the force around the stoma to prevent herniation. The panel is attached to low-elasticity, self-balancing dual straps that wrap around the body to hold the panel in place and securely provide support throughout wear. A simple Velcro closure system makes donning effortless, and a silicone deposition onto the straps makes this belt more secure to wear. Force adjustments are made simple with the use of a cable-driven tightening system. By turning a dial, the force supplied to the hernia-risked region can be adjusted to counteract the forces most likely to create a hernia. Additionally, the cables are guided in a way that prevents panel rotation. Regulatory issues are minimized with this design, which uses materials that are already in medical devices and by designing for extended product life. It is considered a FDA Class I medical device, and would be submitted using the 510(k) exempt pathway based on predicate devices. Existing hernia belt designs cause discomfort, excess motion around the stoma, and donning and adjustment difficulty. This leads to decreased belt usage and hernia formation. This simplified device provides easy steps for donning and adjusting the device, making it more comfortable and potentially increasing use. The force adjustments, foam system, and cable system allows for solid support of the stoma, which could counteract the forces that lead to hernia formation.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The technology is a method using photomediated oxime ligation to covalently decorate naturally derived hydrogels with bioactive proteins, such as growth factors, to spatially control encapsulated cell fate. Natural protein-based hydrogel biomaterials are regularly used in three-dimensional (3D) cell culture and tissue engineering since they mimic many important aspects of native tissue while permitting matrix remodeling and biological integration. However, spatiotemporal control over cell fate within these natural biomaterials has not yet been demonstrated. As a result, there is a need to develop methods to direct complex cell fates in natural hydrogels. The solution is a method using photomediated oxime ligation to covalently decorate naturally derived hydrogels with bioactive proteins, such as growth factors, to spatially control encapsulated cell fate. Photomediated oxime ligation enables user-defined control over when and where ligation occurs with high specificity, thus it is uniquely capable of spatiotemporally regulating cell function in natural protein-based hydrogels. With mask-based and laser-scanning lithographic activation of the photomediated oxime ligation, this method gives full 4D control over covalent protein immobilization within natural polymer-based hydrogels. The competitive advantage of this technology lies in its ability to spatially modify natural protein-based hydrogels with covalent protein immobilization in a highly specific manner. This greatly advances current abilities to recapitulate the dynamic biochemical heterogeneity characteristic to native tissues. As the global biomaterials market size is valued at $155.1 billion in 2022 with an expected CAGR of 15.5%, there is a significant opportunity for this technology to advance the field of biomaterials.",

The durability of the wearable device is improved by undergoing 15,000 stretching cycles without mechanical or electrical failure. A thermoelectric generator can be implemented for stationary conditions to continuously harvest thermal energy. The thermoelectric generator can prevent thermal energy from being wasted due to heat flux. A thermoelectric generator can respond effectively to both continuous and sporadic thermal stimuli. To utilize the temperature difference between the human body and the surrounding environment, previous studies have attempted to integrate thermoelectric (TE) semiconductors into a wide range of material systems such as fibers, thin film, and soft polymers (i.e., elastomers). While each of these device architectures offer unique advantages for wearable applications, elastomers are a popular choice due to their high flexibility and stretchability. Primary elastomer-based TEGs with high performance can be designed by encapsulating rigid inorganic TE semiconductors and flexible conductors (i.e., copper films) encapsulated in silicone elastomers. The limiting factors in this design are inextensible conductors which hinders stretchability and conformability of the device, the low thermal conductivity of elastomers that lowers the efficiency, and the complex fabrication process with large number of components. Continuous powering of wearable electronics and personalized biomonitoring systems remains a great challenge. The solution is a novel additive fabrication method that enables development of stretchable high-performance thermoelectric power generators. Through this unique fabrication process and synthesis of novel composite materials, the energy harvesting performance has increased by more than 7x when compared to previous manufacturing methods. Concurrently, the durability and structural integrity of the wearable is significantly improved as it can go through 15,000 stretching cycles without mechanical or electrical failure.

More recently, they have shown promises in emerging applications such as virtual reality (VR), soft robotics, and haptics.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a dangerous, multidrug-resistant bacterium that poses a significant threat to vulnerable patients, such as those with cystic fibrosis (CF). These individuals often suffer from chronic PA infections, leading to severe respiratory issues and diminished quality of life. PA is also a prevalent pathogen in severe healthcare-associated infections, leading to high rates of illness and death among these vulnerable populations. Furthermore, the bacteria's resistance to multiple antibiotics makes current treatments less effective, highlighting the urgent need for new therapeutic options.

These mAbs specifically target the PA virulence factor PcrV, which is essential for the bacteria's ability to cause disease. In preclinical studies, these antibodies have shown potent anti-PA activity, significantly reducing bacterial burden in a mouse model of pneumonia. This approach harnesses the natural immune response of CF patients to create targeted therapies that can effectively combat PA infections. Targeted Action: The mAbs specifically target the PcrV virulence factor, minimizing the risk of off-target effects. High Affinity: Derived from human B cells, these antibodies exhibit high binding affinity, enhancing their effectiveness. Preclinical Efficacy: Demonstrated significant reduction in PA burden in animal models, indicating strong potential for clinical success.

It can be used for hydrogel resins because it is simple to prepare and biodegradable. Stereolithography (SLA) is one type of vat photopolymerization where a laser is scanned to selectively cure a photocurable resin to form a structure. Unlike some other types of 3D printing, SLA provides the ability to achieve micron scale features resulting in high accuracy parts. While capable of producing a structure having high resolution 3D geometry, SLA is greatly limited by the lack of available resins. Hydrogels include crosslinked hydrophilic polymers and are used in a wide range of 3D printing applications including biomedical implants/drug delivery, tissue engineering/cell scaffolds, and soft robotics. Hydrogels are often used in bio-applications because their high-water content mimics an extracellular matrix and provides a suitable microenvironment for cell growth. There are only a few reported resins capable of 3D printing biocompatible hydrogels through vat photopolymerization. However, these can exhibit poor cell adhesion or may be non-biodegradable. New materials specifically for SLA that are biocompatible, biodegradable, and simpler to prepare, are needed to address these issues. The solution is a methacrylated bovine serum albumin (BSA-MA) resin formation and 3D printing process.

This method uses video recordings from a prior cystoscopy and 3D bladder reconstruction to estimate cystoscope pose within the bladder during follow-up telecystoscopy. Tele-cystoscopy can lower the barrier to access of critical urologic diagnostics for patients around the world. A challenge to robotic control of flexible cystoscopes and intuitive teleoperation is estimation of the location of the scope tip. Because of the often featureless bladder surface and/or the low image quality of bladder frames including low resolution, blurring and distortion, most 3D localization and mapping algorithms based on feature extraction are not applicable or robust. The solution is a novel real-time camera localization method using video recordings from a prior cystoscopy and 3D bladder reconstruction to estimate cystoscope pose within the bladder during follow-up telecystoscopy. It reconstructs the 3D surface of the bladder in the beginning and maps the used frames into a low dimensional space as a dictionary. New frames can be located on the bladder surface by searching the nearest neighbors in the low dimensional space and registering two images. The corresponding 3D camera pose of the new frame then can be efficiently computed based on the camera pose of the dictionary frame. This pipeline is proposed for the first time and the localization is performed in 2D instead of 3D for real-time purposes. This pipeline is originally developed for bladder, but it can be used within other organs such as stomach, uterus, GI tract, nasal and lung, and more general non-medical environments without distinctive features. Existing solutions have low image quality and deal with the issue of a featureless bladder surface, leading to poor 3D localization and mapping algorithms that are based on feature extraction. This algorithm will be able to perform better than existing methods and could help make telecystoscopy a compelling option for urologists and their patients.",

In the field of synthetic biology, creating stable and soluble monomeric proteins that reversibly associate into hetero-oligomers remains a significant challenge. These proteins should ideally be folded and soluble when isolated, yet rapidly and specifically associate when mixed. Creating proteins that can reconfigure themselves into different structures is difficult because the designed interfaces, which are largely nonpolar, can drive not only the association between two different chains but also the self-association of individual chains. This limitation hinders the development of proteins with diverse functionalities and applications. The technology is the design of modular reconfigurable asymmetric protein assemblies. It uses the principles of implicit negative design to generate beta sheet mediated heterodimers. These heterodimers are stable, folded, and monomeric in isolation but rapidly assemble upon mixing. The technology enables the assembly of a wide variety of structurally well-defined asymmetric assemblies, including linearly arranged hetero-oligomers with up to 6 unique components, branched hetero-oligomers, closed C4-symmetric two-component rings, and hetero-oligomers assembled on a cyclic homo-oligomeric central hub.

Despite myriad REP reaction classes, ring-expansion metathesis polymerization (REMP) remains one of the most versatile ways to access cyclic macromolecules. For acyclic polymers, advances in W, Mo, and Ru ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) initiator design have allowed for widespread adoption of this valuable methodology. W and Mo initiators are quite active and desirable for certain applications, but often initiators are derived from more air and functional group tolerant ruthenium N -heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes, such as Grubbs 2nd (G2) and 3rd (G3) generation scaffolds. A sterically demanding NHC imparts stability, while a bulky benzylidene ensures facile ligand dissociation. For cyclic polymers, W and Mo metathesis initiators can facilitate REMP of both alkene and alkyne monomers, but examples are largely limited to hydrocarbon feedstocks. Despite the overwhelming success of Ru ROMP initiators, the Ru REMP initiators developed by Grubbs have never been optimized to the same extent as G2 and G3. Therefore, a need exists for a tunable cyclic Ru-NHC platform for REMP that improves upon the current poor molecular weight control, limited stability, and slow polymerizations. The present invention seeks to fulfill this need and provides further advantages. The solution is a reinvigorated tethered ruthenium-based initiator that utilizes key design features of common acyclic Grubbs-type initiators for linear polymerizations. We demonstrate the controlled synthesis of functionalized cyclic polynorbornenes through gel permeation chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering and viscometry. Judicious ligand modifications to current cyclic ruthenium-based initiators not only drastically improves polymerization kinetics, but also leads to improved initiator stability. Overall, our technology is an adaptable platform for the study and application of cyclic macromolecules via REMP. Current synthetic strategies that utilize cyclic olefin monomer feedstocks suffer from poor functional group tolerance, low initiator stability, and/or slow reaction kinetics. This technology addresses these issues, enabling more versatile and user-friendly technologies.",

This system is rapid and repeatable to fit new applications, eliminating redesign. The solution is reprogrammable metasurfaces. These are a new class of mechanical metamaterials that can be repeatedly reprogrammed after fabrication to match specific conditions. This allows for tailored shape changes in metamaterials by introducing selective biasing forces within a lattice structure, hence inducing buckling patterns that match predetermined profiles. This structure can be rapidly reprogrammed to transform into a wide range of desired shapes and profiles. This has applications for 'E-ink' for blind people, for tactile phone displays, for meta-surfaces of programmable textures, and for robotic grippers. Current mechanical metamaterials offer tailorable material properties but must be designed for a specific task. Redesigning for each task increases costs and limits adoption of this technology.

By considering the preferences of both parties and computing a globally optimal pairing, this technology improves residency match results while increasing the efficiency of the process. The current system of pairing medical students to residency programs has remained relatively unchanged for half a century. The existing methods for determining residency matching are based on the Gale-Shapley method, a \"stable-marriage\" method that prioritizes applicant outcomes. However, this leaves room for improvement; there is still an unmet need for an algorithm achieving optimal matches for both applicants and programs. To solve this, the technology takes the form of a new matching algorithm. This algorithm is developed to optimize residency matching for both the applicants and programs involved, ensuring a win-win outcome for the system as a whole. The technology takes into account the preferences of both parties and computes a globally optimal pairing, resulting in more applicants matching their most preferred programs and better average ranks for both applicants and programs. The technology offers the following advantages:\n\n- Matches applicants to their preferred programs more consistently (78.7%, vs 71.5%)\n- Programs and applicants both achieve better average ranks, increasing by more than 3 places and half a place respectively\n- Increased optimization means residents will have greater insight into which programs they are more likely to successfully match thus optimizing which programs, and how many, to apply to.\n- And, programs can optimize their time by interviewing fewer candidates, but those most desirable that are likely to accept their offers.\n- Broad applicability to any similar system, involving applicants submitting weighted preferences.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a temperature sensitive photo-release tape that adheres to human skin to reduce the risk of medical-adhesive-related skin injuries. The tape is composed of a temperature sensitive polymer and a near-infrared absorbing layer for thermal feedback. Medical adhesive tapes are an integral part of healthcare delivery and are used in all care settings to cover and secure to the skin wound dressings or critical medical devices such as intravenous (IV) lines. Medical tapes consist of pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) applied to a plastic or fabric backing that functions as a carrier for the adhesive, providing structural and protective properties. The combination of different backings and adhesives determines the characteristics of the tape, including levels of adhesion and water resistance, and informs nurses\u2019 decisions in the selection of the appropriate tape for a patient in a specific situation. Without means of safe removal, these stronger adhesives are difficult to painlessly remove from the skin and may cause medical-adhesive-related skin injuries (MARSI), including skin tears and an increased risk of infection. Lower-adhesion medical tapes may be applied to avoid MARSI, leading to device dislodgement and further medical complications. There is a need for a high adhesion tape that can transition to a low adhesion tape upon removal. The solution is a temperature sensitive photo-release tape. The PSA has a temperature sensitive polymer additive that transitions when heated above skin temperature but below the skin pain threshold. A near-infrared (NIR) absorbing layer in the tape is coupled with an NIR optical wand with thermal feedback. This new NIR optical wand was designed for rapid and noncontact release, with short NIR exposure causing the tape to heat and reduce adhesion, allowing for lower-adhesion removal. The unique properties of this multifunctional system (tape and portable NIR wand) may allow even stronger skin adhesion for critical medical devices while concurrently reducing the risk of MARSI upon photo release and easy removal. While high-adhesion medical tapes are effective and easy to apply, the adhesion of these tapes can increase over time, leading to a painful and time-consuming removal process that may ultimately result in tape-induced injuries. Lower-adhesion medical tapes increase the risk of critical device dislodgement and is classified as a medical error. ThermoTape is the first temperature-sensitive tape that functions in the human skin temperature range. In vitro testing has demonstrated retention of high adhesion at normal skin temperature (35 \u00b0C), and 67.5% reduction in peel force adhesion when raised to 45 \u00b0C both in vitro and in vivo. A recent clinical trial showed statistically significant results for pain reduction when heat was used for removal. ThermoTape can potentially significantly reduce the risk of MARSI while simultaneously providing the high adhesion required for secure attachment of medical devices during hospital care.",

    "ip_description": "This technology offers innovative protein nanoparticles designed for efficient secretion in eukaryotic cells, enhancing genetic delivery and therapeutic applications. Efficient secretion of protein nanoparticles from eukaryotic cells is a significant challenge in biotechnology. Hydrophobic interfaces are essential for protein nanoparticle assembly, but often form cryptic transmembrane domains that can embed in cell membranes and thus hinder their secretion. As a result, many designed protein assemblies fail to secrete effectively, limiting their potential in therapeutic and genetic delivery applications. Understanding and controlling the secretion of protein nanoparticles is crucial to optimize the development of secreted protein technologies. The technology uses a novel approach to optimize the secretion of de novo designed protein nanoparticles. By using a computational protocol called the Degreaser, cryptic transmembrane domains are identified and redesigned without compromising protein stability. This method significantly improves the secretion efficiency of protein nanoparticles, making them more viable for use in various biotechnology applications, including vaccines and therapeutics. This technology represents a significant advancement in the field of protein engineering, providing a robust solution to a common bottleneck in the production of therapeutic proteins. Enhanced Secretion Efficiency: The Degreaser protocol ensures that protein nanoparticles are secreted as efficiently as naturally occurring proteins. Versatility: This technology can be applied to a wide range of protein assemblies, making it broadly useful in different biotechnology fields.

    "ip_description": "Augmented reality (AR) applications are becoming increasingly pervasive in our modern world. This innovation addresses the critical challenges in the management of AR security, including input/output management, the resolution of conflicts between content and the real world, and the running of concurrent AR applications. In our world of rapidly advancing technology, augmented reality (AR) systems are becoming more and more commonplace. From tech innovations as high-end as the Apple Vision Pro to the accessible experience of Pok\u00e9mon Go, AR is transforming the way we interact with both the physical and the digital world. However, this rapid advancement brings with it a host of security and privacy challenges. In considering the security challenges, both the input and output to the device must be considered. On the input side, AR applications operate with unrestricted access to sensors, which means they can potentially see sensitive information. As the range of AR applications expands, so does the risk of malicious software. On the output side, an application's interference with a user's perception can lead to a host of issues. Applications can block important details in real life, conflict with each other's visuals, or disrupt the user physiologically such as with sudden flashing lights. Additionally, in multi-person AR scenarios, other users present potential risks such as unwanted flooding of a user's display with objects from another user, or vandalism of created artwork by other passing users. These challenges underscore the need for robust, multi-faceted security solutions in AR systems. It is important that these issues are considered and resolved, to provide frameworks for the further development of AR applications. The suite of technologies available for licensing offers a comprehensive solution to the security and privacy challenges in AR systems. These technologies, developed over several years and detailed in various research papers and patents, address the critical issues in AR output management, content sharing, and concurrent application operation. One of the foundational innovations of this work is the proposition that AR objects are to be managed at the operating system level, instead of directly by applications. This change in paradigm allows visuals from multiple applications to be managed together and opens the door for the rest of the work. This technology handles conflicts between AR applications, or with the real world, through the use of an output policy module enforcing policy-based constraints on application outputs. These can be based on real-world policies; for instance, a guideline that real-world trees should not block road signs is adapted that virtual objects should not block road signs. Similarly, an input module determines whether applications requesting sensor access should be allowed to have the input information. The technology controls the policies for these input and output sources, aiming to combat the wide range of security issues potentially present in the evolving AR world. This platform for AR security offers several advantages: Comprehensive Outlook: The technologies aim at several important areas of AR security and privacy concerns, ranging from potentially sensitive input data to the handling of multi-user AR experiences. Proven Effectiveness: Developed over years with support from academia and industry, this is not only a proposed design for a system, but one that has been prototyped and evaluated. Market Need: With the continual development of AR integration such as the work done by Microsoft, Meta, and BMW, this technology is essential in combating the issues of AR security before the applications become even more mainstream.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "This technology cancels the leakage in a transceiver, a component that transmits signal, by eliminating interference issues, and allowing the receiver to detect weak signals. Modern wireless transceivers often transmit and receive signals simultaneously. This is problematic as the transmitted signal will interfere with the receiver's ability to detect weak signals. The integration of radios in silicon exacerbates this interference problem by placing both the transmitter and receiver in close proximity, thus reducing the isolation. The invention is a novel method for cancellation of leakage in a transceiver, which cancels any component of the transmit signal in the receiver. This is a circuit topology which is implemented in silicon and can be made completely programmable between multiple RF standards. The invention is two methods to either suppress or remove transmit to receive interference. The first method implements in silicon, a circuit which intentionally injects a component of the transmit signal into the receiver to cancel the undesired component of the transmit signal which has leaked through the substrate, the board, or on the chip. The second method implements in silicon the function of an isolator which essentially decouples the signal path from the transmitter to the receiver. Although different circuits, with different functions, one does cancellation while the other improves isolation, they both address the same problem of self-interference from the receiver to the transmitter. An off-chip surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter is usually connected between the low noise amplifier and downconverter to further suppress transmitter leakage. However, these filters are band specific, prohibiting highly programmable solutions. Moreover, additional discrete filters are area inefficient, and increase cost/power consumption. Several recent efforts have attempted to attenuate or reduce the effect of transmitter leakage in the receiver signal path. However, these recent approaches tend to utilize an active cancellation path, which is problematic from a noise and power perspective. This method cancels the leakage at the source, eliminating interference issues, and allowing the receiver to detect weak signals.",

    "ip_description": "This technology offers a freely everting tube robot that can sense acoustic signals and pressure changes. It can limit insertion forces and the spread of bacteria in sensitive biological environments. Everting tube robots (ETR) (also referred to as vinebots) are flexible robots made from soft and extendable tube materials. Some ETRs are freely everting, meaning that they take the path of least resistance, and some ETRs can be steered with motors or integrated actuators. ETRs have been researched for exploring and navigating small and difficult to reach places. The tube extends by application of air pressure, which causes the tube to elongate by pulling tube material from inside itself. This internal feeding mechanism does not create friction against the environment, which enables these robots to navigate small, irregular, and complicated passageways. Due to the low friction and force that the robot has on the surrounding environment, it has been researched for sensitive environments, such as brain tissue imaging. However, little work on sensing capabilities for ETRs has been done due to the difficulty of integrating sensors on the distal parts of the everted tube, limiting the potential applications and adoption of this technology. The solution is a freely everting tube robot that can sense acoustic signals and pressure changes. This technology is enabled by sensors on the pressure vessel, which is where the ETR originates. These sensors do not travel with the tube during expansion, and sensors are coupled with algorithms that output pressure and audio data along the length of the tube. This could lead to broader applications such as sensitive medical applications where imaging with endoscopes is not practical, as ETRs can limit insertion forces and the spread of bacteria. Existing ETRs do not have sensing capabilities, limiting the potential applications of this technology.

This system includes an input user interface, sensors, transforming mechanism, and control units with voice recognition. An estimated 75 million people or approximately 1% of the world's population are wheelchair users. Specifically, as of 2016, approximately 3.6 million people (roughly 1.2% of the US population) require the use of a wheelchair. For wheelchair users, using the restroom is inconvenient, physically stressful, and dangerous. Much of the time, wheelchair users need to haul themselves out of their wheelchair in order to move onto the toilet, with accidents and injuries being common. According to the FDA, 73% of cases of such accidents resulted from falls and tips during this process. Thus, many wheelchair users choose not to use public toilet facilities out of fear of embarrassment. The solution is a smart multifunction wheelchair system for safe and easy use of public restrooms for wheelchair users. This can be automatically transformed from a normal wheelchair to a roll-over-toilet design so that it can be used in normal toilet stalls in public restrooms. The wheelchair system includes an input user interface system, a sensor/measurement system, transforming mechanism, and a control unit. The wheelchair system controls can include any traditional user interface such as a joystick or voice recognition module. The measurement system collects preliminary information of the environment and locates (aligns) the wheelchair. An electrical jack lift system is used to safely lift up the patient's seat vertically while the wheelchair is being rolled over the toilet. There are some current approaches that have tried to address this problem. For example, some companies have developed roll-over-toilet designs that have a permanent hole in the wheelchair seat enabling the chair to fit over some standard toilets. However, these are not suitable for long-term daily use due to comfort issues. Additionally, some public restroom toilets are too tall to be used for these roll-over-toilet wheelchairs. This system would allow users to confidently use bathroom stalls, on a comfortable and reliable wheelchair. This system is compatible with most public toilets and is not constrained by variations in height.",

In this way, the cane user can be instructed to simply load the cane until they feel the vibration in the cane handle. The vibrational feedback informs the user that they have achieved the desired cane body weight support. Existing canes do not offer feedback during use and are often self-prescribed. This means that many patients are not trained in how to use a cane. This results in improper cane use, and continued knee issues.

    "ip_description": "This application harnesses a convolutional neural network to analyze blood-oxygen saturation data captured by smartphone cameras, achieving clinical-grade accuracy in blood-oxygen saturation monitoring. It represents a significant advancement in mobile health diagnostics, enabling precise, non-invasive respiratory screening.\n\nBlood-oxygen saturation (SpO2) is an essential health metric indicating how well oxygen is distributed throughout the body. Optimal SpO2 levels hover around 96-98%, reflecting efficient oxygen transport and utilization. However, when SpO2 levels fall more than 5% below an individual\u2019s baseline, it may signal underlying respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, or COVID-19. These conditions can precipitate a decline in SpO2, leading to hypoxemia\u2014a state of diminished oxygen in the blood. If unaddressed, hypoxemia can escalate to hypoxia, where tissues are deprived of oxygen, causing irreversible damage.\n\nTraditionally, SpO2 is measured using pulse oximeters, non-invasive devices that estimate SpO2 levels by transmitting light through the skin. Recognizing the potential for broader health monitoring, researchers have explored smartphone technology as an alternative. Smartphones could theoretically replicate the function of pulse oximeters, but existing attempts have faced challenges in accuracy, user experience, and lack of clinical validation. There is a pressing need for a smartphone-based application capable of reliably screening SpO2 levels. Such an app would harness the widespread availability of smartphones, offering a convenient and non-invasive tool for early detection of respiratory issues, potentially saving lives by prompting timely medical intervention.\n\nThe solution couples a wider range of clinically relevant SpO2 data with modern advances in data analysis techniques to not only make a more accurate tool, but extend it to predicting hypoxemia. The software\u2019s foundation is a dataset derived from a Varied Fractional Inspired Oxygen (Varied FiO2) study, conducted by a clinical validation laboratory. This dataset is pivotal as it provides a wider range of training data in clinically relevant regimes, distinguishing this software from previous attempts.\n\nTo capture SpO2 data, the app utilizes the smartphone\u2019s camera and flashlight. The data undergoes optimization via predefined camera settings, including color gain and white balance adjustments, to ensure precision before analysis. At the core of the technology is a convolutional neural network (CNN) meticulously crafted to replicate the mathematical principles underlying traditional pulse oximeters, mitigate the influence of heartbeat variability on measurements, and effectively manage the inherent noise in smartphone camera signals. The app achieves an overall mean absolute error (MAE) of 5% in SpO2 readings. It also demonstrates commendable performance in detecting low SpO2 levels\u2014those below 90%\u2014with 81% sensitivity and 79% specificity. These metrics are indicative of the app\u2019s reliability and its potential to serve as a valuable tool for early detection of respiratory issues.\n\nThe competitive edge of this smartphone application lies in its ability to accurately measure blood-oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels in clinically relevant lower ranges using just the phone\u2019s camera and flashlight. Notably, it is the first model to perform below the 85% SpO2 threshold, and overall has an error margin only 2% greater than FDA-cleared pulse oximeters.\n\nThe app\u2019s deep learning model is fine-tuned with clinical data obtained from the Varied FiO2 procedure. This extensive training enables the app not only to provide precise SpO2 readings but also to offer guidance on when to seek medical care if low levels are detected. Such functionality is particularly beneficial given the widespread incidence of respiratory ailments, including asthma, pneumonia, and COVID-19. As a result, this technology is poised to make a significant impact in the expanding field of smartphone-based health diagnostics, offering a practical solution for continuous respiratory health monitoring.",

    "ip_description": "This technology offers mixed conductive interphases for solid state batteries without the issues of ceramic cathodes. The system is thin, percolative, and can be in-situ formed by a low-melting-point sintering additive with a ten-times and three-times area capacity improvement over the state-of-the-art cathodes. Solid-state batteries (SSBs) could significantly improve safety and energy density over the liquid cells. One key enabling technology is the high energy all ceramic cathodes. NASICON-type LATP is considered as one of the most attractive solid-state electrolytes on the cathode side due to its high oxidation potential and high ionic conductivity. The usage, however, is limited by its large interfacial resistances against most of the cathode materials, due to the chemical potential incompatibility as well as the thermodynamic instability during high temperature sintering that is usually needed to achieve high mass density. These issues have limited the progression of this technology. The solution is a thin, percolative, and mixed conductive interphases can be in-situ formed by a low-melting-point sintering additive. These mixed conductive interphases drastically improve the kinetics, leading to high-loading solid LATP/LiCoO2 cathodes up to ~ 6 mAh cm-2. The technique is also applicable to Ni-rich cathode materials, achieving up to ~ 10 mAh cm-2, which is expected to enable high energy density in SSBs. These composite cathodes show a ten-times and three-times area capacity improvement over the state-of-the-art cathodes using oxide and sulfide SSEs, respectively. Solid state battery development has been hindered by issues with high energy all ceramic cathodes, due to the large interfacial resistances. This has led to continued use of liquid cells. This solution is enabling for solid state batteries, as it can drastically increase area capacity without the issues of ceramic cathodes.",

    "ip_description": "This technology offers a method to convert and upcycle spent coffee grounds into a binochar capable of removing contaminants from water. Compared to activated carbon, it significantly reduces the carbon footprint by not generating greenhouse gasses. Carbonaceous media such as activated carbon possess high porosity, large surface area, and surface functional groups that facilitate removal of many contaminant classes via pore diffusion, surface complexation, and other weak interactions. As such, activated carbon is widely used adsorbent in water treatment. Activated carbon is generated by pyrolysis of carbon-rich source materials (e.g., coal, tar coconut husks, tar pitch) followed by chemical activation to achieve high reactivity for air and water purification. Unfortunately, activated carbon is expensive ($1000/ton), high levels of chemical additives are needed to achieve activation, and its production contributes to greenhouse gas emissions (18 kg CO2 eq/kg produced). Conversely, biochar is a low-cost pyrolyzed carbonaceous media that can offer similar benefits as activated carbon, and can be produced under more environmentally friendly conditions. Biochar biomass food waste sources can include wheat straw, rice hulls, wood, and switchgrass. The intended functions of the porous, carbonaceous biochar are to improve soil properties and fertility, and retain water and nutrients in soils as a soil amendment. Recent investigations suggest a capacity of biochar to remove nutrients, bacteria and pathogens, heavy metals, and organic compounds in water. The solution is a method of converting and upcycling spent coffee grounds into a binochar capable of removing contaminants from water. The used coffee grounds are washed and pyrolyzed. The heating and pyrolysis conditions are controlled to increase the resulting biochar surface area and porosity. A benign industrial caustic agent (potassium hydroxide) is added during pyrolysis to further maximize these biochar properties that contribute to contaminant removal. Preliminary tests reveal that the modified spent coffee ground biochar can remove over 95% of harmful organic contaminants in water. Furthermore, negligible amounts of caffeine are leached from the biochar which further increases its safety in water treatment applications. The granular media is well-suited for filtration applications for urban stormwater and point-of-use filtration to increase contaminant removal. The benefit to activated carbon is that it is already well-suited for water purification and is currently used in home filters and municipal water treatment plants to remove dissolved organic carbon, select trace metals, and organic compounds in water. However, producing activated carbon generates greenhouse gasses and contributes to global climate change. This system is sustainable as it upcycles spent coffee grounds, significantly reducing the carbon footprint when compared to activated carbon.",

    "ip_description": "This technology offers a new type of fire extinguisher for use in microgravity environments. This system can mitigate fire in space by using vortex generators to quench flames with sufficient speed and strength. Fire extinguishers are essential safety equipment not only in commercial and residential buildings on Earth, but also in low-Earth orbit and beyond as humans make progress in space exploration. Unlike fires on Earth, fires in space and similar microgravity environments are unusual in shape and can spread in any direction due to low gravity and the movement of air in space stations or spacecraft cabins, making fires in space highly dangerous. Although the best method to fight fire in space is prevention, mitigation methods (such as the use of CO2 and H2O) are currently available in space stations. However, these mitigation methods are quite laborious and contaminate the atmosphere, creating a hazardous breathing environment for crew members after the fire is extinguished.

    "ip_description": "This technology offers an angioscope that uses a catheter to view, diagnose, and treat Chronic Total Occlusions (CTO). This method would provide the potential with a faster procedure and faster CTO clearance. Over the next two decades, the proportion of the U.S. population with cardiovascular disease is expected to rise to 45%. A chronic total occlusion (CTO) occurs in cardiovascular disease patients when slow build-up of plaque eventually causes a complete blockage of a blood vessel and is diagnosed in about 30% of patients with coronary disease. The restricted blood flow due to the CTO stops oxygen from being properly circulated by the blood, which can cause patients to experience pain and fatigue. In order to treat the CTO in arteries, doctors can first visualize the blockage by using an angioscope. The angioscope is a flexible cable that is used for high resolution images of the interior of vessels when it is inserted and threaded through a vessel. However, angioscope usage comes with a risk of creating high pressures inside a weakened artery that would further damage or even rupture the artery. The solution is a design for an angioscope that uses a catheter to view, diagnose, and treat Chronic Total Occlusions (CTO) usually found inside coronary arteries. The catheter consists of multiple optical channels that transmit light for viewing the interior region of the artery and two additional lumen that allow fluid to move between them. The first channel is a saline injection channel and the second a suction lumen used to remove saline and blood from within the artery. The injection of saline and suction of blood helps clear the opaque medium between the catheter and the CTO, which allows the interventionist to observe the occlusion and treat the artery. Current catheters utilize injection of saline and suction of the saline-blood mixture at constant pressures, but this solution involves the synchronization of the injection and the suction, such that they are equal in terms of mass flow rates of the fluid instead of the pressure, which prevents the buildup of high pressure within the artery. The synchronization of the two channels is done using a syringe pump which controls both lumens or by two different syringes/pumps optimized by a flow controller that regulates the mass flow rates. Existing designs can create high pressures inside a weakened artery, which can further damage or even rupture the artery. The solution generates lower pressure in the artery compared to current models. This reduction in pressure could reduce the risk of artery rupture or damage, and perhaps make coronary CTO\u2019s more approachable for direct intervention. Additionally, this innovation has the potential to speed up the procedure by allowing CTO's to be cleared faster and more often, conferring greater ease for both doctors and patients facing treatment of CTO.",

This biopsy can be removed and undamaged after tissue imaging.\n\nWhat is the Problem?\n\nTissue removed from the human body is often a requirement for making a diagnosis of disease and determining its stage of progression. To preserve the living state of the tissue, the tissue is typically placed in chemical preservative within 3 to 5 minutes of being removed from the body. Handling of this vital tissue from biopsy device to imaging for disease diagnosis requires sample preparation procedures that require several manual steps in the process. A core needle biopsy (CNB) procedure is an example of a minimally-invasive method of removing vital tissue from the human body to determine if an area is cancerous. The rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) for a CNB involves manually removing a small thread of tissue from a needle of 1-2 millimeters in diameter and touching and rolling it against a microscope slide to remove cells from the outer surface. This method is damaging to the CNB integrity for further downstream analysis.

Thinly sectioned 2D core biopsies, which are chunks of biological tissue, contain the most information that best represents the in vivo condition of a disease state. However, 2D slides are inherently distorted and disorienting when observed by pathologists, hence significant tissue architectural information is lost. Three-dimensional (3D) imaging aids pathologists by providing an even more complete picture of the disease state, which promotes rapid on site evaluation and enhances diagnostic accuracy. However, manual handling of bulk biological tissue samples required for 3D imaging is difficult due to tissue viscoelasticity. Consequently, fixing, staining, and optical clearing of such biological tissue samples is inherently time intensive. These factors have been raised by clinicians as major limitations for the rapid processing and throughput of intact, 3D biological tissue samples to be used for diagnosis and study. Removal of these 3D samples often cause the biopsy to fold over itself, or be damaged by manipulation. There is a need for a 3D biopsy sample removal method that maintains the orientation, shape, and structure of the sample. The solution is a milli-fluidic design which can work across all tissue types and a range of needle sizes to easily remove a core needle biopsy from the core sampling needle while retaining its orientation, shape, and structure. The design is automation friendly, works with sidecut and endcut biopsy needles and can be used to transport the biopsy to processing (staining, etc) and imaging chambers. Existing solutions methods of 3D biopsy removal result in the sample losing its original orientation, shape, and structure, limiting the usefulness of the sample for diagnosis. This method maintains the original orientation, shape, and structure, allowing for consistent usages of 3D biopsy samples.",

    "ip_description": "Existing implantable neurostimulators treat a variety of neurological disorders via open-loop stimulation and are typically non-rechargeable where invasive surgery is necessary to replace the device. To addresses this concern, this technology is an open-loop brain stimulator with real-time communication. This device offers a long battery life, limiting invasive surgery and provides a new method for calculating deep brain stimulation.\n\nThe solution is a closed-loop deep brain stimulator. This is done by incorporating sensors and having real-time communication to the implanted neurostimulator. This could result in lower power dissipation over the time and reduced side effects from unneeded stimulation. This closed loop deep brain stimulation device is currently being developed for the management of essential tremor. The team has demonstrated systems capable of using a variety of sensors including inertial measurements, electromyography and neurostimulator electrode readings. This sensed data is used to modify stimulation within the limits pre-set by a clinician, thus resulting in a closed-loop system. This technology utilizes a new method for calculating the duration of bursts that will be used for closed-loop deep brain stimulation control.\n\nCurrent deep brain stimulators are open-loop and thus are always stimulating the brain regardless of the severity of the symptoms, which can vary significantly. This constant stimulation decreases battery life, meaning that invasive brain surgery to replace the battery is needed more often. Additionally, the unnecessary constant brain stimulation may lead to side-effects. The competitive advantage is a longer battery life than the competitors, limiting how often invasive brain surgery needs to occur. The closed loop deep brain stimulator will allow patients with Parkinson's to achieve a consistent gait.",

This system conducts deep brain stimulation and adapts its response with the stimulation frequency varying between low (i.e. 60 Hz) and high (>130 Hz) frequencies to improve gait.\n\nFreezing of gait (FOG) is a devastating motor symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease that leads to falls, reduced mobility, injuries, and decreased quality of life. Reliably eliciting FOG has been difficult in the clinical setting, where there is limited documentation of the efficacy of treatments. Deep brain stimulation has been demonstrated to improve gait irregularity and freezing of gait. Specifically, there is growing evidence that lower frequency stimulation (e.g., 60 Hz) may be more therapeutic than higher frequencies (\u2265 130 Hz), while higher frequencies may be more beneficial for other signs and symptoms such as rigidity or tremor. However, there is no way to adapt the frequency to respond to current conditions.\n\nThe solution is an algorithm that employs statistical analysis of gait parameters and/or FOG to adapt either intensity or frequency of the deep brain stimulation to improve gait. Once gait has been restored or the person is no longer walking, the system can switch back to prior frequency intensities. If variability in the gait is high, the system can adapt the stimulation frequency to a lower frequency (e.g., 60 Hz). Once the variability has decreased such that gait is more regular, the stimulation frequency can be switched back to a high frequency (\u2265130 Hz).\n\nThere is limited documentation of the efficacy of methods such as different frequencies of subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN DBS). Current solutions in the deep brain stimulator space do not have the adaptability of responding to changes in gait. This adaptability will increase the effectiveness of the treatment.

    "ip_description": "The solution is a method to develop new antibiotic proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) that target proteins of interest for degradation in bacteria to counteract antibiotic resistance. Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are heterobifunctional chemicals that simultaneously engage two proteins, a target protein of interest and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. PROTACs are highly effective at degrading proteins of interest and have the potential to overcome resistance to therapeutic treatments. However, PROTACs are largely untested in prokaryotic systems because bacteria lack the mammalian ubiquitin system required of PROTAC design. To address the continuing threat of antimicrobial resistance, there is a need to develop new antibiotic chemistries to actively counteract microbial resistance. The solution is a method to develop new antibiotic PROTACs (AnTACs) that target proteins of interest for degradation in bacteria to counteract antibiotic resistance. AnTACs are composed of a classic target engagement strategy (antibiotic), chemical protease degrons, and variable linker chemistries. The antibiotic component of the AnTAC will kill bacterial cells and proteins of interest will simultaneously be targeted for degradation. Proteins responsible for antibiotic resistance, such as beta-lactamases, will also be targeted for degradation by AnTACs. Finally, AnTACs are highly likely to interfere with bacterial protein hemostasis, a possible new route of antibiotic activity. The competitive advantage of this technology lies in its ability to simultaneously kill bacterial cells and target proteins responsible for antibiotic resistance for chemical degradation. AnTACs are completely new means to addressing the issue of antibiotic resistance and have clinical potential to treat bacterial infections. They also present an exciting set of potential tool compounds for research use. As the global antibiotics market is valued at $50.9 billion in 2023 with an expected CAGR of 4.2%, there is a significant opportunity for this technology to advance the field of antibiotic therapies for infectious diseases.",

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a blood disorder in which patients have diminished expression or function of von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWF is a blood-clotting protein and low expression can lead to reduced blood clotting ability in patients. Methods of studying VWD and its potential therapeutics are currently limited to VWF knockout animal models and VWF-deficient human donor EC models. These methods are limited by the high degree of variability between donor cell populations, and the low tolerance of passage that the cells have in culture. The solution is the disclosed technology that offers a CRISPR-Cas9 generated, isogenic hPSC-EC in-vitro model for studying disease dynamics and therapeutic candidates for VWF-deficient diseases, such as VWD. This innovation provides an isogenic VWF hPSC-EC cell line proven to be an accurate model for assessing the efficacy of new therapeutics in VWF-deficient diseases. The model enables therapeutic efficacy studies through highly sensitive induction of VWF expression, increasing the clotting ability in patients with VWD. The competitive advantage of this technology lies in its ability to improve research methods for studying VWD and potential therapeutics. With a population prevalence of clinically relevant reduced VWF levels estimated to be approximately 1% in the United States, and high costs associated with treating severe VWD, this innovation has the potential to contribute to the development of more effective and cost-efficient treatments.

The device is a capsule that scans the esophagus to detect a characteristic dark pink color indicative of BE when swallowed and positioned. Barrett's Esophagus (BE) is a condition of the lower esophagus that is pre-cancerous- a precursor to cancer of the esophagus. The standard practice for diagnosing BE is using flexible endoscopy, often with the esophageal lumen filled with air. BE can occur without telltale symptoms, so mass screenings have been proposed as the only viable approach to identify the condition as early as possible to enable treatment and avoid the onset of or provide a curative therapy for the cancerous condition. However, the numbers of people that are likely candidates for esophageal screening and the current cost associated with the practice of flexible endoscopy performed by a physician compared to the reimbursement associated with such mass screenings make this solution currently impractical. A much more efficient and cost-effective approach for identifying people with BE. This disclosure is a proposed tethered-capsule endoscope for observing BE that is a less invasive and more affordable approach to diagnosis. A capsule is coupled to a tether that is manipulated to a desired location. The capsule is swallowed and positioned with the tether to enable the scanner in the capsule to scan a region of the esophagus above the stomach to detect a characteristic dark pink color indicative of BE. The light from the scan is processed immediately, which can give a diagnosis of BE. The capsule can also be used for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes in other lumens. Currently, only a doctor can perform an examination of the esophagus using a conventional flexible endoscope, and the procedure is thus relatively expensive. Images have to be processed by the doctor, adding to the cost. This scanning technique can be performed by a trained medical technician or nurse. The evaluation of images produced are automatically processed, allowing for the immediate evaluation of BE. This makes scanning for BE more affordable and accessible, and therefore more feasible to perform on large patient populations.",

    "ip_description": "ThermoTape is a temperature sensitive photo-release tape that adheres to human skin to reduce the risk of medical-adhesive-related skin injuries. Medical adhesive tapes are an integral part of healthcare delivery and are used in all care settings to cover and secure to the skin wound dressings or critical medical devices such as intravenous (IV) lines. Medical tapes consist of pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) applied to a plastic or fabric backing that functions as a carrier for the adhesive, providing structural and protective properties. The combination of different backings and adhesives determines the characteristics of the tape, including levels of adhesion and water resistance, and informs nurses\u2019 decisions in the selection of the appropriate tape for a patient in a specific situation. Without means of safe removal, these stronger adhesives are difficult to painlessly remove from the skin and may cause medical-adhesive-related skin injuries (MARSI), including skin tears and an increased risk of infection. Lower-adhesion medical tapes may be applied to avoid MARSI, leading to device dislodgement and further medical complications. There is a need for a high adhesion tape that can transition to a low adhesion tape upon removal. The solution, ThermoTape, is a high-adhesion medical tape designed for low skin trauma upon release. A temperature sensitive copolymer was developed and combined with a selected pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) material. By warming the skin-attached tape for 30 seconds, a significant loss in adhesion is achieved. Heat is directly applied to the tape with a heat pack or other source. This tape can be manufactured with a variety of methods that are compatible with roll-to-roll processes. While high-adhesion medical tapes are effective and easy to apply, the adhesion of these tapes can increase over time, leading to a painful and time-consuming removal process that may ultimately result in tape-induced injuries. Lower-adhesion medical tapes increase the risk of critical device dislodgement and is classified as a medical error. ThermoTape is the first temperature-sensitive tape that functions in the human skin temperature range. In vitro testing has demonstrated retention of high adhesion at normal skin temperature (35 \u00b0C), and 67.5% reduction in peel force adhesion when raised to 45 \u00b0C both in vitro and in vivo. A recent clinical trial showed statistically significant results for pain reduction when heat was used for removal. ThermoTape can potentially significantly reduce the risk of MARSI while simultaneously providing the high adhesion required for secure attachment of medical devices during hospital care.",

Heart failure is a significant health issue with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and impaired mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) processing, is a critical mediator in the progression of heart failure. This dysfunction initiates a vicious cycle of inflammation, further impairing mitochondrial function and leading to the activation of circulating immune cells and increased production of inflammatory cytokines, such as Interleukin 6 (IL6). The current therapeutic options for heart failure are often insufficient in addressing this underlying mitochondrial dysfunction. The presented research proposes an innovative approach to heart failure treatment, focusing on improving mitochondrial function. This is achieved by using a NAD precursor, nicotinamide riboside (NR), which has been shown to protect mitochondrial function and reduce inflammatory cytokine production in peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC) both in vitro and in vivo in heart failure patients. Additionally, the research identifies the malfunction of endonuclease P, specifically the downregulation of one subunit, MRPP2, as a primary cause of inadequate mtDNA transcript processing in failing hearts. Normalizing MRPP2 levels in mouse failing hearts has shown to improve mitochondrial function and reverse the course of heart failure. The competitive advantage of this research lies in its potential to transform the treatment paradigm for heart failure by focusing on improving mitochondrial function. This approach, combined with the use of a novel therapeutic agent, nicotinamide riboside (NR), offers a promising avenue to not only manage but potentially reverse the course of heart failure.

This technology shows vast potential as a laboratory for experimenting with the fractional quantum anomalous hall effect, and as a transformative innovation working towards realizing a topological quantum computer.\n\nEfforts to harness the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) for quantum computing have gained traction, driven by the quest for topological qubits. According to Microsoft, a quantum computer built on this type of qubit would be \u201cfaster, smaller and less prone to losing information than other types of qubits under development\u201d. In addition, a quantum computer based on topological qubits could be run at temperatures above that of liquid helium, greatly reducing the cost to run the device. According to cutting edge theory, the construction of a topological qubit could be feasible by leveraging non-Abelian anyons, special quasi-particles predicted to be possible in the fractional quantum Hall effect.\n\nThis technology creates a platform for the study of the fractional quantum Hall effect through the use of twisted molybdenum ditelluride bilayers. This MoTe2 material has all of the correct properties for showing the fractional QAHE desired, including its magnetic ordering and band structure. Through heavy hole-doping of the contact region, the device manufactured around the MoTe2 successfully makes low-resistance electrical contacts, solving an issue that has plagued the field.\n\nWith this device, electrical conductivity signatures of both the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and the fractional QAH are observed to confirm earlier predictions and signatures. The device is set up as a multi-gate transistor, showing promise as a platform for research into the fractional quantum hall effect.

Using ultrasonic waves, the contactless approach allows the picking up and moving of small, delicate objects only millimeters in size. Even to this day, the ways in which robotics manipulate objects are ill-adapted for dealing with small and delicate objects smaller than a centimeter. With limited precision in gripping force and positioning, objects a few millimeters in size fall beyond the capability of modern general-purpose robots to hold and move without damage. Objects of this size are important in fields ranging from medicine to semiconductors, as well as in basic research. While specialized robotics are available with this capability, the specialization extends to the point that they cannot be used beyond their specific purpose. There is an unmet need for a method allowing general purpose robots and robotic arms to handle small, delicate objects on the millimeter scale. Sound waves are used to hold small objects in the air, created by two rings of ultrasonic transducers. The levitation achievable by this device is capable of picking up small polystyrene balls 1 to 2 millimeters in size, a type of sample too small and too delicate for a common gripping setup to pick up without damage. The form factor of the double ring is easily attachable to a general purpose robot without modification, allowing manipulation of small delicate objects such as flower petals, integrated circuits, or small insects for analysis. The major advantage of the technology is its general applicability, both in terms of setup and in usage. Because it is based on sound waves, it can pick up any kind of material (unlike magnetic levitation). In addition, the design allows mounting on any kind of general use robot, with strong enough force to resist samples being blown away by air flow during movement. As an added bonus, the non-contact holding method means that the sample can be observed from all angles without obstruction.",

Using next-generation long-read RNA isoform sequencing, the alternatively spliced exon in PSEN2 was found to be significantly enriched in patients with sporadic AD compared to healthy patients. As this is specific to sporadic AD, the aberrant PSEN2 exon can be targeted using antisense oligonucleotides for both diagnosis and treatment applications.

    "ip_name": "WatchLink: Enhancing Smartwatches with Sensor Add-Ons via ECG Interface",
    "ip_number": "BDP 8947",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "WatchLink uses the electrocardiogram (ECG) interface built into smartwatches to integrate various external wearable sensors, expanding the health monitoring capabilities of the smartwatch with minimal added power and cost requirements. Current smartwatches are limited by their built-in sensors, restricting their ability to monitor a broad range of physiological metrics. Additionally, the lack of efficient data import methods means that many specialized health monitoring sensors, such as UV light sensors for outdoor workers or air quality sensors, must function independently of the smartwatch. This separation increases costs and complexity, as these sensors need their own systems for sensing, processing, storing, and communicating data. The main challenge is to bridge the gap between a smartwatch\u2019s data processing and visualization capabilities and the integration of these external sensors. The solution lies in leveraging existing sensors on the smartwatch for low-cost and low-power communication. WatchLink employs the electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor built into commercial smartwatches as an interface to connect external sensors. The ECG sensor, designed to monitor heart activity by detecting small variations in electrical activity on the skin, is well-suited for picking up low-power signals. By transmitting voltage signals from the external sensor through the skin to the smartwatch\u2019s ECG sensor, WatchLink operates efficiently with only 50 microwatts of power. Competitive advantages include: Low Power Consumption: WatchLink operates with only 50 microwatts of power, making it highly energy-efficient and suitable for continuous monitoring without significantly draining the smartwatch\u2019s battery. Minimal Hardware Modifications: WatchLink\u2019s approach requires no changes to the existing smartwatch hardware, facilitating easy adoption and integration with current smartwatch models. Side-Channel Sensing: By utilizing the ECG sensor for communication, WatchLink leverages existing hardware to transmit data from external sensors, eliminating the need for additional communication modules. Versatile Sensor Integration: The technology supports a wide range of external sensors, including those for monitoring UV light, air quality, and other niche health metrics, as well as multiplexing signals from multiple sensors. Seamless Data Transmission: The high gain of the pre-existing ECG sensors ensure reliable and accurate data transfer from even weak voltage signals to the smartwatch, maintaining the integrity of the collected data.",

    "ip_number": "BDP 8486",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The Z-Ring is a wearable input technology that leverages bio-impedance sensing to facilitate a wide range of interactions, including gesture input, object recognition, user identification, and interaction with passive user interfaces. The Z-ring presents an elegant method for intuitive interaction and detection. Designed as a wearable ring, it uses electrodes on the finger to monitor the hand's electrical impedance. The impedance changes based on various factors such as finger movements, contact with different surfaces, or even the person using the ring. This allows the Z-ring, using only one sensor, to demonstrate a wide range of capabilities, including single- and two-handed gesture recognition, input using a set of passive UI elements, object recognition, and highly accurate user identification. The Z-ring uses only a single sensing methodology, a co-located electrode pair, making it well-suited for everyday use and future miniaturization. The design of the ring is compact, using the hand as an antenna while still being able to collect a wide range of information. Spanning a wide breadth of tasks, the Z-ring demonstrated high accuracy in features such as single- and two-handed gesture recognition (up to 93% accuracy), tangible input with passive touch UI elements (91.8% accuracy), object recognition across six household objects (94.5% accuracy), and user identification among 14 users (99% accuracy).",
