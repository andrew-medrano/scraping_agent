    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method for improving probiotic resistance to conditions in the gastrointestinal tract by simultaneously delivering probiotics and extracts of fruit and vegetables rich in polyphenols which fight inflammation and improves health in the GI tract. Probiotics, live microorganisms that provide health benefits when consumed, are increasingly linked to positive health outcomes, but they are highly sensitive to the acidic conditions of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially when they need to be delivered to lower GI tract. To address this delivery obstacle, companies have been searching for methods of stabilizing probiotics by utilizing resistant strains, microencapsulation, and spray drying. As a natural and gut-friendly alternative, researchers at the University of California, Davis did a study on the synergism between probiotics and phenolic compounds or plant-based prebiotics. After vacuum infusion of plant extracts rich in polyphenols, probiotics become more metabolically active, making probiotic encapsulation unnecessary to deliver high amounts of probiotic cells into the gut. The infusion of certain plant extracts also increases the probiotics\u2019 hydrophobicity, which may reduce oxidative stress or inhibits enzymatic activities, and increase their survivability. Additionally, probiotic cells infused with plants extracts were shown to enhanced tolerance against simulated gastrointestinal treatments without any change in their metabolic activity or antagonistic activity towards pathogens. Useful to probiotic and food companies. Eliminates the need for probiotic encapsulation. Improve probiotic binding to gut wall and other microbial structures. Combines the co-delivery of plant-based prebiotics with probiotics.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have developed a modified, caninized monoclonal antibody that targets canine PD-L1, developed for use as dog cancer therapy. Engagement of PD-L1 with PD-1 inhibits TCR-mediated T cell proliferation and cytokine production. PD-L1 plays an important role in tumor immune evasion. PD-L1 antibodies are widely used in cancer therapy in humans. Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have developed a modified PD-L1 antibody for use in dogs. JC071c is a new and improved variant of a pre-existing canine PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, JC071, modified using canine framework sequences in variable regions along with canine IgGD heavy chain and kappa light chain constant regions. This modification aims to increase its effectiveness in cancer therapy in treating canine patients. The significant reduction in foreign murine sequences in JC071c minimizes unfavorable immune reactions in the canine body compared to JC071 and JC071ch. Additional related developments: *   **2021-660 JC071c1, a Caninized Monoclonal Antibody Mutant Specific for Canine PDL1 That Could Avoid Potential Nglycosylation and N-deamidation within CDR Sequences:**\u00a0A specifically engineered, caninized monoclonal antibody mutant designed for the treatment of cancer in canine patients. It targets canine PD-L1 and has been modified to avoid potential N-glycosylation and N-deamidation within CDR sequences, preventing loss of activity after production. The modifications include mutations on light chain N28 (CDR1) and heavy chain T57A, enhancing the stability and potential effectiveness of the antibody. *   **2021-661** **JC071c2, a Caninized Monoclonal Antibody Mutant Specific for Canine PDL1 That Could Avoid Potential Nglycosylation and W Oxidation:** A\u00a0modified version of a previously developed canine PD-L1 specific caninized monoclonal antibody, JC071c. Modifications were carried out on residues within CDR sequences, N-glycosylation on light chain N28 and W50 oxidation. These modifications, achieved through mutations, could potentially enhance the effectiveness of the antibody in cancer therapy for dogs by making it more stable than JC071c. *   **2021-662 JC071c4, a Caninized Monoclonal Antibody Mutant Specific for Canine PDL1 That Could Avoid Potential Nglycosylation within Light Chain CDR1:**\u00a0A\u00a0caninized monoclonal antibody specific for canine PDL1, designed to prevent potential N-glycosylation within light chain CDR1. It aims to enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapy applied to canine patients. JC071c4 is potentially more stable than its predecessor, JC071c, derived from the same group, since it removes a N-glycosylation residue within the light chain CDR1 sequence. *   **2021-663 JC071ch, a Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody Specific for Canine PDL1:**\u00a0A modified canine anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody, designed to improve the effectiveness of canine cancer therapy. The antibody has been altered to include canine IgGD and kappa counterparts, with murine IgG1 and kappa light chain constant regions, potentially leading to less adverse immune responses when administered to canine patients.

Existing techniques for monitoring fetal health have a high rate of false positive for detection of fetal hypoxemia, which leads to many unnecessary interventions. The Transabdominal Fetal Oximeter (TFO) developed at UC Davis emits near infrared light through the maternal abdomen to detect variations in diffused light intensity caused by physiological differences in tissue composition. The light signal is then analyzed by a novel algorithm to determine fetal oxygen saturation (by removing the contribution of the maternal oxygen level). Key considerations are patient safety and obtaining strong and reliable signals without overexposure to light or increasing maternal abdominal skin temperature. The technology employs methods and systems to maintain safety throughout the procedure. The technology overcomes the limitations of traditional cardiotocography machines, addresses the lack of direct fetal blood oxygen saturation level measurement, and solves the challenge of balancing signal strength with patient safety. Applications include healthcare providers and medical facilities involved in childbirth, medical equipment manufacturers in obstetric care, and research applications in the field of fetal health monitoring. Features/Benefits include providing more objective metrics of fetal well-being, being non-invasive and safe for both fetus and mother, improved signal strength without compromising safety, including a provision for temperature and motion management for comprehensive monitoring, and interfacing with existing EFM (Electronic Fetal Monitoring) machines.",

    "ip_description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a bio-neurological developmental disability that generally appears before age three. Children with ASD often experience difficulties in verbal and non-verbal communication, social interactions, and leisure or play activities. In 2020, the CDC reported that approximately 1 in 36 children (2.8% of the US) were diagnosed with ASD. Boys are four times more likely to be diagnosed than girls, with most children diagnosed after age four. Therapeutic interventions are most effective if applied early; however, diagnosis is challenging and often delayed, primarily because the current diagnosis identifies abnormal behaviors that do not emerge until the disorder is well-established. In addition, there is no laboratory-based test for ASD. Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have developed a diagnostic test for ASD that analyzes biomarkers (measurable biological traits) in newborns. These genetic and DNA methylation biomarkers can be measured in the placenta and blood samples and shown to identify newborns at highest likelihood for developing ASD. The test enables early autism risk assessment, leading to earlier and more effective behavioral intervention. Applications: Early screening of ASD in newborns. Features/Benefits: Laboratory test that uses DNA from placenta, maternal or newborn blood for detecting ASD. It provides the first early screening test for ASD and can be used for early therapeutic and behavioral intervention.

Autoimmune and inflammatory disorders are a broad category of diseases in which the immune system attacks healthy cells. After cancer and heart disease, autoimmune diseases are the third most common, affecting approximately 8% of the population. These diseases affect almost every organ in the body, including neurologic, cardiac, endocrine, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal (GI), lung, kidney, skin, eye, and vascular systems.

    "ip_description": "The large-scale use of hybrid seeds over the past century has contributed to a revolution in agriculture. Hybrid crop plants produce high yields, but due to genetic segregation, their progeny have variable and frequently low yields. This means that hybrid seeds have to be generated afresh for every season, using labor-intensive methods such as hand pollination, resulting in substantially higher costs. Consequently, hybrids are underutilized for many crops, especially by farmers in developing countries. Recently a technology called synthetic apomixis has been developed to enable hybrid rice plants to produce seeds that are genetic clones of the parent plant, such that the progeny can produce the same high yields as the parent plant. The method mimics a process called apomixis that occurs naturally in many asexual plant species, and utilizes genome editing together with manipulation of gene expression to bypass both genetic segregation and fertilization. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed an efficient strategy for stable parthenogenic rice plants, these plants produce seeds that are genetic clones of the parent plant. The technology utilizes genome editing along with manipulation of gene expression to bypass genetic segregation and fertilization resulting in parthenogenesis frequency as high as 90% through the expressional combination of two transcription factors, BBM1 and WOX9A. Applications: Application in large-scale agriculture, especially in hybrid crop production. Could be used in genetic engineering research and applications. Potential applications in other cereal crops such as maize, wheat, and barley and possibly in dicot crops like canola and tomato. Features/Benefits: Produces high-yield crops through cloned seeds. Significantly reduces the costs associated with hybrid seed production. Increases parthenogenesis efficiency significantly to 90%, a critical threshold for practical utility. Has potential applications in other cereal crops and possibly in dicot crops. Addresses the issue of the high cost of producing hybrid seeds every season. Solves the problem of genetic segregation and fertilization in seed production.

PET is a minimally invasive imaging modality with a wide range of clinical and research applications, such as cancer, infectious diseases, inflammation, and neurological conditions. PET offers three-dimensional mapping upon administering positron-emitting radiopharmaceuticals such as (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose to measure metabolism.

    "ip_description": "Cherenkov radiation (CR) results when a charged particle, such as an electron, travels through a medium faster than the phase velocity of that medium. CR has unique properties that make it useful for medical imaging, biomolecule identification, and particle detection, however, its applications are largely limited due to the extreme particle speeds required to emit CR. To generate such particle speeds, it is typically necessary to use particle accelerators or nuclear reactors as energy sources. Other limitations of this technology include large, bulky, designs with complicated optical setups and the requirement of cryogenic temperatures during operation. A new method of generating CR more efficiently is needed to make it more accessible for a majority of applications.\n\nResearchers at the University of California Davis have developed a solid-state device that utilizes CR to emit photons in the THz and IR range with a low-energy electron beam energy input. The input energy, provided by a simple DC voltage, generates electron carriers in the device. The device\u2019s hyperbolic nanostructures then couple electron carriers into photon emission, thus allowing the device to generate light at a tunable frequency. Aside from low energy requirements, this device is also compact and fully operational at room temperature. The use of CR to generate tunable, broadband light emission with minimal energy requirements makes this device suitable for a variety of applications within wireless communications, medical imaging, particle detection, and other fields.\n\nApplications:\n* Wireless communications and processing systems with up to terabit-per-second data rates\n* High-resolution medical imaging systems\n* Particle sensing and spectroscopy\n\nFeatures/Benefits:\n* First implementation of Cherenkov Radiation using a simple DC voltage source\n* Tunable light emission in the THz and IR frequency bands\n* Operable at room temperature\n* Small, compact design",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis (\u201cUC Davis\u201d) have developed an optical absorber/emitter for thermophotovoltaics application with a tunable emission wavelength. Thermophotovoltaic cells convert thermal energy into electricity by transferring heat into light photons captured by traditional solar cells. Typical applications include capturing wasted energy from heat loss in industrial processes (e.g., steam engine turbines), heat shields, nuclear materials, etc. The major limitations of state-of-the-art thermophotovoltaic systems are that they normally operate at a high temperature, greater than 900oC, and they are manufactured using a complicated 2d or 3d nanofabrication process. The developed nanostructures are complex, making conventional thermophotovoltaic designs impractical to build at the large scales often required for industrial applications and limiting their useful service life. Researchers at UC Davis have developed a thin-filing-coating/substrate two-layer thermal absorber/emitter structure configured with controllable emission properties at ultra-high operating temperatures. The thermal absorber/emitter structure is composed of a substrate made of a first material and a thin-film layer/coating made of a second material that is disposed on the substrate. Use of a single thin-film layer/coating provides control and tuning of the emission properties of the overall two-layer structure. Both materials selected for the absorber/emitter structure possess high melting points to withstand extreme temperature variations. Note that the simple two-layer design of the absorber/emitter structure reduces the likelihood of thermal failure and the use of a single coating on the substrate makes it easier to choose thermally matched materials. Moreover, for the properly selected materials, the thin-film layer or coating can serve two functions: (1) as a protective barrier/interface; and (2) as the primary optical layer. Furthermore, the absorber/emitter structure can be easily scaled up for commercial applications. Applications: Design/manufacture of more efficient thermophotovoltaic energy generation systems, Effective energy recovery from heat loss in a range of industrial applications, Suitable for applications in aerospace heat shields, turbine designs, nuclear materials, satellites, and thermal cloaking. Features/Benefits: Single-layer, ultrathin films can be manufactured using a simplified and scalable process, Tunable wavelength response, Up to 400% increase in heat\u2192energy conversion efficiency compared to state-of-the-art systems, Operable across a range of temperatures (e.g., above 1500\u00b0C) with increased product durability.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have developed a headset (e.g., virtual reality headset) in which two imaging modalities, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO), are incorporated with automated eye tracking and optical adjustment capabilities providing a fully automated imaging system in which patients are unaware that images of the retina are being acquired. Imaging takes place while the patient watches a soothing or entertaining video. Many techniques used by ophthalmology personnel are non-invasive but require a patient to be focused on a specific point or region in their field of vision. Most of these methods are easy to perform with a cooperative patient. However, in children and patients with mental disabilities, most, if not all, ophthalmology techniques can be nearly impossible to perform due to a lack of cooperation by the patient, often resulting in misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of eye conditions in these patients. Due to the manual and complex nature of setting up conventional imaging systems, the involvement of expert clinicians and technicians, and full cooperation of the patient in the process is required. In addition to limitations with certain patient groups, the unavailability of trained personnel and the extra cost associated with their involvement further make it difficult for patient groups in remote and underserved areas to access imaging technologies. As a result, there is a need to develop other techniques that benefit patients with mental disabilities, making the process as seamless as possible and for use within the entire ophthalmic patient population including remote and underserved areas by making the technology easier to use and more accessible. The developed invention provides a fully automated imaging system in which a patient is unaware that images of his or her retina are being taken.

These advanced component technologies for hyper-spectral imagers realizing 100x reduced size, weight, and power while supporting 1000x framerates in support of high performance. Hyperspectral imaging captures a wide range of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. Since materials emit or reflect unique combinations of electromagnetic radiation, hyperspectral imaging is useful for identifying specific materials in astronomy, chemistry, environmental imaging, and other research fields. Most hyperspectral imaging setups require large optical grating devices to take up significant amounts of space and suffer from poor resolving strength relative to the amount of power consumed. Furthermore, hyperspectral imaging is not often used with compressive signal processing techniques, which limits the maximum signal bandwidth that can be captured. The creation of a more compact hyperspectral imaging device that is compatible with compressive sensing is needed for a variety of applications. Researchers at UC Davis have developed two novel designs to achieve hyperspectral compressive imaging in a compact form factor. The first method involves using metalenses to capture images at different wave polarizations, where each lens has a reconfigurable aperture. This design\u2019s versatility allows for optimization for various imaging applications that can be trained with machine learning algorithms. The second proposed method uses an array of waveguide routers to capture hyperspectral image data. Both techniques can capture data across several wavelength spectra simultaneously, offering an advantage over the common line-scan approach. Each design is compatible with compressive sensing imaging processing and requires less sophisticated hardware to fit in a compact footprint.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Doppler radars can determine the distance and speed of an object by sending a signal of a certain tone and observing the phase difference between the transmitted signal and its reflection off of an object. If the object\u2019s distance from the radar is a multiple of the signal wavelength divided by 4, detection nulls occur, and the gain of the radar becomes unusable. To overcome detection nulls, quadrature demodulation is commonly used to extract phase information received by the radar. However, quadrature demodulation requires highly precise matching circuitry and intensive digital signal processing. Such signal processing necessitates powerful onboard computers and negatively impacts the system\u2019s power efficiency. A Doppler radar that can overcome detection nulls without using quadrature demodulation would greatly improve performance and power efficiency. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed Doppler radar designs that simultaneously achieve ultra-low power consumption, ultra-low phase noise, free of detection nulls, and ultra-high displacement-sensing resolutions without using quadrature demodulation. The radar design uses low-noise sub-sampling phase-locked loops (SSPLLs) with the same reference (REF) signal to generate single-tone transmitted/radiated signal and a local oscillator (LO) signal. As a result, no quadrature demodulation is required, and the elimination thereof enables use of circuit design and hardware that are greatly simplified compared to conventional systems. A reflected signal (derived from an object) is downconverted into a time domain square wave, allowing for a simplified demodulation process and signal processing. A phase demodulator (PDM) is used to extract displacement-induced phase information from the square-wave signal and a PDM output is filtered to provide a signal proportional to vibration displacement of the object causing the reflected signal. With less computationally intensive digital signal processing, the power efficiency is improved compared to existing products. This radar is suitable for applications that require immense precision realized through its ultra-high-resolution capabilities.",

The importance of gut repair pathways goes beyond one infection or condition. Microbially derived bioactive molecules are also superb candidates for combating multiple inflammatory gut diseases as they are naturally occurring and can promote a large variety of repair pathways through epigenetic modulation.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a unique approach to target solid tumors using novel Fas-targeting antibodies designed for improved selectivity and efficacy in immunotherapy. Fas levels remain elevated in various solid tumor types. Furthermore, the full efficacy of CAR-T strategies also relies on Fas-dependent bystander killing of tumor cells. Hence, a series of tumor-specific Fas-targeting antibodies have been developed in both monospecific and bispecific formats. These antibodies demonstrate unmatched specificity to ovarian and other solid tumors expressing hypo or non-glycosylated form of Fas receptor, distinguishing them from engaging T-cells expressing the fully glycosylated form of Fas. This selective targeting facilitates apoptosis in tumor cells without compromising immune homeostasis, offering a potent and safer alternative to cancer treatment. Bispecific antibodies comprising antibodies to Fas and co-targeting ovarian tumor-overexpressing antigens have been developed. The anti-tumor antigen component of the bispecific antibody finds an anchor on the surface of ovarian cancer cells through high affinity binding to the tumor-specific antigen. This additional mechanism further restricts cell death-inducing agonist activity of anti-Fas antibody (selectively targeting non-glycosylated receptor) to the antigen-enriched ovarian tumor microenvironment, resulting in an-avidity optimized bispecific binding and higher order Fas apoptotic signaling only in tumor cells but not in healthy cells or T-cells expressing fully glycosylated Fas. Applications include increased selectivity for tumor cells over healthy cells and T-cells, reducing potential side effects; capability to induce apoptosis specifically in solid tumors, including ovarian, TNBC and other tumor types, through targeting non-glycosylated Fas receptors; enhanced tumor specificity and efficacy through bispecific format targeting both Fas and tumor-overexpressed antigens; and addressing the limitations of current immunotherapies by instigating tumor cytotoxicity in solid \u201ccold\u201d tumor types having limited immune infiltration. Features/Benefits include a solution for low clinical response rates of existing immunotherapies and CAR-T strategies in solid tumors; overcoming the problem of effective immune effector cell infiltration in solid tumors; and versatility of bispecifics combining Fas antibody with an antibody to a second tumor specific antigen to target different types of tumors.",

Unfortunately, in at least 1 billion of these cases, vision impairment could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed. In the US, eye disease leads to more than $139 billion in economic burden. The most common eye conditions include age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and cataracts. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive imaging modality used throughout medicine that generates images of biological tissues with high axial and transverse resolutions. While it is a standard for diagnosing eye conditions, it still suffers from limited resolution, large file size, high technical expertise, and expensive systems. Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have developed a new optoretinography system using tissue velocity obtained from a modified OCT system. The system avoids the need to track specific cells over time, obviates the cost and labor of the position-based approaches such as adaptive optics, digital aberration correction and real time tracking.

    "ip_description": "The gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a key role in mediating the absorption or other bioactive compounds (e.g. drugs, gut flora metabolites) and shaping host immune responses. Dysfunction of GI is related to chronic inflammatory conditions, e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, and cardiovascular disease and neurological disorders. While in vivo studies using animals such as gnotobiotic mice have been indispensable in observing associations between the gut and wider aspects of host health, in vitro models of the GI tract are highly coveted due to their relative simplicity and relative ease of use. Indeed, in vitro models of the gut epithelium have immense utility in facilitating molecular mechanistic studies that provide clinically useful insights into the manifold ways in which the GI tract regulates human health. For example, primary-derived intestinal epithelial tissues have been used to construct intestinal organoids that recapitulate physiological functions of the GI tract and model GI disease pathophysiology and studying drug responses. However, unlike the tubular structures of the GI tract, current models engineered from intestinal organoids exhibit a spherical structure with epithelial cells enclosed inside the organoids. Such enclosed spherical structure limits drug or nutrients access to the epithelial lumen and induces epithelial cell death in the inner part of the organoids, preventing continuous growth of organoids and creating a hurdle for drug screening. In order to overcome these limitations, researchers at UC Davis have developed a novel 3D printing approach that can produce tubular epithelial organoids and mini-tissues of greater size (upto 7 cm) and geometric complexity than what was previously possible. The system can produce, for example, perusable, tubular mini-gut with epithelial organoids such as intestinal organoids The culture system can be produced via a 3D printing process.",

Swimming-related injuries, including shoulder injuries, are common, with most injuries occurring during training sessions. Such injuries happen for various reasons, including lengthy training sessions, improper stroke movement/patterns, poor posture, and swimmer fatigue. Swimwear manufacturers have focused on addressing these issues by developing technical/high-tech swimsuits for short-duration competitive swimming rather than for extended use during training sessions. In addition to using high-tech swimsuits during competition, other injury prevention/recovery techniques include modifying training routines by resting/decreasing session length, using Kinesio taping of the shoulders, physical therapy, and wearing posture shirts. These methods can increase the amount of training required to maintain peak performance and may only address one cause of an injury (e.g., Kinesio tapes only address shoulder posture, not overall swimmer posture). Researchers at UC Davis have developed a swimwear garment that can be worn over traditional swimwear or against the skin. The swimwear garment helps to improve form and positioning in the water to reduce injuries and allows injured swimmers to continue training while recovering from their injury. The swimwear garment is focused on addressing injury risk factors by promoting core muscle activation, raising a swimmers body position in the water, improving shoulder posture to help reduce the possibility of injury, and assisting swimmers with posture and maintaining correct form.

These microbial-based solutions offer a cost-effective and easily deployable strategy to manage Striga infection in the predominantly smallholder farmer-driven sorghum cultivation of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSorghum, a vital cereal crop in sub-Saharan Africa, frequently faces significant yield losses due to infestations by the parasitic weed Striga hermonthica. Striga attaches to sorghum roots and penetrates their tissues, causing reduced water and nutrient uptake, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and decreased yields. Existing Striga management methods have proven inefficient and challenging to integrate into traditional agricultural practices.\n\nThis technology identifies a novel approach to combat Striga infection by harnessing the power of beneficial soil microbes. UC Davis researchers discovered a soil microbiome that suppressed Striga infection in sorghum by increasing suberin content in the plant's root system. Mathematical modeling predicts the specific microbial genera responsible for this suppression. Among the selected candidates, an Arthrobacter strains was highly effective at inducing suberization of endodermis and exodermis, which strengthened the suberin barrier in sorghum roots.\n\nApplications:\n* Sorghum Agriculture: This technology can be applied to sorghum cultivation in sub-Saharan Africa, providing a cost-effective and accessible method for managing _Striga hermonthica_ infestations, thus improving crop yields and food security.\n* Microbial Inoculants: The _Arthrobacter_ strain can be developed into microbial inoculants applied to sorghum seeds, seedlings, or soil to enhance the suberin barrier and protect the crop from _Striga_ infestation.\n* Plant Biotechnology: Advances the understanding of suberin deposition in plant roots, potentially leading to the development of genetically enhanced sorghum varieties with stronger suberin barriers.\n\nFeatures/Benefits:\n* Effective Striga Management: The technology offers an effective and sustainable solution for controlling Striga hermonthica infestations in sorghum, reducing crop losses, and improving food production.\n* Affordable and User-Friendly: Microbial-based solutions are cost-effective and easy to implement, making them particularly suitable for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a device for multi-dimensional data extraction at the molecular level to allow one to simultaneously detect the presence of a single-molecule electrically, and to extract a chemical fingerprint to identify that molecule optically. Recent technological advancements in nanoscience have allowed for the study/manipulation of materials at the molecular and atomic levels yielding a better understanding of how molecular structure influences various chemical reactions, surface interactions, and charge transport dynamics. Instrumentation, including field-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and single-molecule characterization used for nanoscale characterization purposes have resulted in the development of novel techniques in genome sequencing. These techniques can be used to evaluate the vibrational and electronic structure of individual molecules; however, they have proved to be less effective than required for simultaneously extracting multi-dimensional data depicting the optical, electrical, and mechanical properties of individual molecules, in situ due to the complexity in performing these measurements. As a result of these limitations, improvements in single-molecule characterization techniques are required. Researchers at UC Davis have developed a multidimensional tool capable of simultaneously characterizing both the structural and transport properties of individual molecules through the acquisition of tunneling currents and Raman spectra in a single device. Raman enhancement between two nano-electrodes, combined with direct charge transport measurements, allows for concurrently acquiring electrical, optical, and mechanical information about a single molecule. The correlation of electron transport measurements with enhanced Raman scattering of an individual molecule bound between two nanostructured electrodes results in evidence of single-molecule Raman scattering with millisecond temporal resolution. Such simultaneous data extraction provides information about the chemical fingerprint of a molecule, along with data on its configuration, information concerning the strain applied on individual chemical bonds, and how this relates to charge transport properties within the molecular junction. Applications: Molecular electronics, Chemical sensing, analysis, Spectroscopy, molecular identification. Features/Benefits: Fast, millisecond temporal resolution using a simple device, Single molecule data acquisition; electrical, optical, mechanical, transport data.",

These affinity peptides have the potential to not only provide a highly sensitive method for diagnosis, but also to block viral entry and initiation of infection, offering a new avenue for treatment of COVID-19 and Zika virus infection. Taking advantage of the high surface area of porous nanofibers, immobilization of these ligands on nanofibrous membranes allows the development of personal use sensors that can achieve low nanomolar sensitivity in the detection of the S-protein in saliva. This simple biosensor employing naked-eye reading exhibits detection sensitivity comparable to some of the current FDA-approved home detection kits. Further, these peptides can be optimized to promote site-specific irreversible covalent ligation, potentially making them potent covalent inhibitors of the S-protein-ACE2 receptor pathway. Applications include point-of-care or household COVID-19 tests for rapid and accurate diagnosis, therapeutic applications in treating COVID-19 patients by blocking the viral entry and initiation of infection, and potential use for inhalation-based therapies to limit infection or treat pulmonary infections of COVID-19 patients.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a computer-based method to synthesize continuous speech from biosignals, including brain activity, in real-time. Neurological injuries such as a stroke or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can result in speech disorders whereby an individual cannot properly communicate. One emerging solution for speech-impaired populations is to bypass damaged parts of the nervous system using a brain-computer interface (BCI) which provides a direct communication pathway between the brain and an external device. Such a device can directly decode/interpret the individual's intended/targeted speech from brain activity that is normally used to control the tongue, jaw, lips, voice box diaphragm, and other muscles associated with speech. To date, speech BCIs have achieved accurate output of the user\u2019s intended words as text, thanks in part to reducing the complexity of the problem to predicting phonemes and the statistical power of language models. However, these current text-first BCI devices do not accurately capture the full expressive range of speech patterns and the full richness and instantaneous communication abilities of the human voice. Researchers at UC Davis have developed a novel computer-based technique to train a speech decoder to instantaneously output the intended voice of individuals who cannot speak. The developed training technique obtains biosignals from an individual attempting to generate a speech pattern/sequence using a sensor (e.g., video, audio, intracortical) data. Using a developed speech synthesis model, a synthetic target speech signal is generated that is representative of the user\u2019s intended/targeted speech sequence. The biosignals data and generated synthetic target speech signal are then aligned, which allows them used together to train causal algorithms (e.g., using deep learning) that accurately map biosignals to the targeted speech sequence/signal. This voice synthesis approach works with very low latency and is capable of providing intelligible, naturalistic voice even for a BCI user with anarthria who is unable to provide any ground truth speech data for algorithm training.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a computer-based method to evaluate/quantify the intelligibility of speech synthesized by a brain-computer interface or other speech prosthesis. Neurological injuries such as a stroke or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can result in speech disorders whereby an individual cannot properly communicate. One emerging solution for injured or speech-impaired populations is to bypass damaged parts of the nervous system using a brain-computer interface (BCI) which provides a direct communication pathway between the brain and an external device. Such a device can directly decode/interpret the individual's intended/targeted speech from brain activity normally used to move the tongue, jaw, lips, voice box, and diaphragm. Closely related types of speech prostheses may instead generate speech from non-invasively measured biosignals, for example muscle activity of retained movement after laryngectomy or for silent speech applications. A current limitation of these technologies is that there are no established metrics in place to gauge/quantify how well the speech prosthesis is functioning (e.g., is the quality of the synthesized speech intelligible/understood by an intended listener). This problem is particularly acute if there\u2019s no ground truth target voice to compare the synthesized voice to, but rather just the text of the intended speech. Researchers at UC Davis have developed a novel system, a deep-learning based, automated speech recognition (ASR) technique to access/evaluate how intelligible speech is. The developed \u2018Artificial Intelligence (AI) Listener\u2019 can generate a numeric score to quantify the quality and understandability of the speech generated by a BCI, other speech-producing technology, or natural (but potentially dysarthric) speech. The synthesized speech signals of interest (e.g., originating from the brain via a BCI) are input into an ASR model for analysis. The ASR generates an intelligibility metric by comparing the intended/targeted speech sequence with the synthesized output speech pattern. The system can produce a variety of intelligibility assessment metrics, ranging from wholistic phrase word error rates down to phoneme error rates and lower-level acoustic feature scores. Applications: Using automated/computerized speech recognition to assess speech intelligibility, Speech restoration in hearing-impaired individuals or those affected by neurologic injuries/diseases resulting in speech disorders, Quantifying and comparing the performance of different voice synthesis technologies and algorithms, Providing a cost function for training voice synthesis algorithms, Setting objective targets for device performance, for example for clinical trial efficacy or reimbursement criteria.

Two recently FDA-approved immunotherapies for B-cell malignancies target CD 19, in the form of a Bi-specific T-Cell Engager (BiTE) antibody construct or chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells. Blinatumomab, an FDA approved BiTE, binds to CD19 on B cells and to CD3 on T cells, mediating effector-target cell contact and T-cell activation that results in effective elimination of target B cells. Although CD 19 expressed by essentially all B-cell malignancies at clinical presentation, relapses with loss or reduction of CD 19 surface expression are increasingly recognized as a cause of treatment failure. Therefore, there is a clear need to develop therapeutics for alternate targets. Researchers at UC Davis have developed CD22xCD3 BiTE antibody that has significant in vitro and in vivo activity against ALL and in addition may synergize with blinatumomab. The CD22xCD3 BiTE demonstrated activation of effector T-cells and prolonged survival of mice with xenografts with minimal toxicity. The novel CD22xCD3 BiTE may offer an alternative or companion therapy to CD 19-based treatments. In addition, UC Davis researchers have developed tri-functional T-cell engager molecules that comprise two recognition arms (anti-CD22 and anti-CD3 single-chain antibodies) and a central activating cytokine.

As a measure of cytotoxic potency or efficacy of a drug, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) is the concentration at which a drug exerts half of its maximal inhibitory effect against target cells. Some methods of determining IC50 require applying additional reagents or lysing the cells, and may require significant time and effort. In many methods, cells are destroyed by the reagents, preventing repeated measurements over time. Therefore, there is need for an efficient, non-toxic and label-free method to measure the efficacy of a drug. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed an artificial intelligence system, called SIC50, for testing the efficacy of drugs and chemicals by classifying phase-contrast images and process those images with convolutional neural networks. Researchers used deep learning to analyze and classify histological images in which they observed a high level of accuracy associated with binary classification of cancer cells and pluripotent stem cells.

    "ip_description": "This technology introduces a peptide derived from the KSHV LANA (latency associate nuclear antigen), a herpesviral protein, that interacts with cellular protein CHD4. The herpesviral protein utilizes cellular CHD4 to silence host gene transcription. The CHD4 is an essential protein for preventing undergoing cell differentiation in physiological cellular conditions. The viral peptides bind to and induce CHD4 degradation, therefore inducing cell differentiation. This peptide provides a potentially novel approach to regulating cellular protein functions, which can help control cell apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and cell identities. This peptide is the first of its kind, as there is currently no CHD4 inhibitor in the market. The technology would also address the current inefficiency and heterogeneity in reprogramming cells for treatment. The application of peptides and then inducing cell differentiation stimuli substantially enhances terminally differentiated cells in vitro. In addition, with xenograft studies, the peptide treatment significantly slows cancer cell growth.\n\nApplications:\n* Cancer therapeutics, particularly for lymphoma and leukemia.\n* Cell therapy for various diseases to enhance terminally differentiated cells.\n* Combination with chemotherapy.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed an autonomous crop transportation robot to aid field workers during harvest. For many fresh-harvest crops, such as strawberries, grapes, cherry tomatoes, and berries, manual harvesting is the norm as it allows workers to selectively pick crops at their peak ripeness. Most commonly workers place crops in a cart or wheelbarrow and walk them back to a collection station at another location on the farm. Extensive transportation results in wasted time as workers spend more time walking back and forth between locations rather than picking crops. Consequently, robotic vehicles have been considered as a solution to improve crop harvesting efficiency. However, existing systems aren\u2019t fully autonomous and often require significant training time to learn new terrain and scheduling patterns to effectively deliver crops. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a fully autonomous crop transportation robot to improve harvesting productivity without additional programming or training. As soon as the weight of a collection basket indicates that it is about to be full, these robots travel to the picker, deposit an empty crop container, and transport the full one to the drop-off location. Data collected by each machine, such as location and crop weight, is sent to a field computer to generate real-time analytics. From there, predictive scheduling directs where robots are sent to minimize waiting times. Predictive algorithms offer a major advantage over existing systems and allow one robot to service multiple workers simultaneously. These crop-delivery robots save time, reduce the physical toll on workers because they don\u2019t need to carry the crops to the collection station, and as a result improve overall harvesting productivity. Applications: Robotic vehicles to aid workers during crop harvests. Features/Benefits: Predictive scheduling to minimize worker waiting times, one robot can transport crops for multiple workers simultaneously, doesn\u2019t require additional training time or programming.",

Infectious diseases continue to present significant challenges because viruses acquire the ability to overcome host immune responses and spread efficiently. In particular, mosquito-borne viruses (such as flaviviruses) collectively infect hundreds of millions of people annually, are expanding their geographic ranges, and have vectors that are hard to control using conventional methods. However, current state-of-the-art strategies to prevent arbovirus transmission are either resource intensive (e.g., genetically engineering mosquitoes to manipulate fertility/fecundity, sex ratio, or vector competence for arboviruses) or virus specific. Moreover, the current approaches often do not target viruses from different families and cannot prevent transmission of unidentified viruses. Thus, researchers at UC Davis have developed improved techniques for addressing the significant health challenges associated with viral infections. In particular, the researchers have developed fusion proteins effective in inhibiting the replication of diverse groups of viruses.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is used to treat a variety of conditions - including severe acne and other skin conditions, ophthalmic diseases, blood-borne viruses in blood plasma, and cancerous tumors - by inducing targeted cell death. Cells are injected with small molecule photosensitizers and then irradiated with light in order to create reactive oxygen species (ROS) that ultimately destroy the cell. This procedure\u2019s non-invasive nature offers several advantages over competing treatment options, and there are generally fewer complications in patient recovery. However, PDT has several drawbacks, usually involved with the use of existing photosensitizers. These compounds suffer from non-specific localization and poor long-term retention in tumor sites, limiting their effectiveness as treatments against deep tissue tumors. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a fiber-forming nanophotosensitizer, known as PQC NF, that provides enhanced cellular targeting and photosensitizer accumulation in PDT cancer treatments. The PQC NF is a self-assembling nanostructure composed of mitochondria-targeting small molecules. With administration directly to the mitochondria of malignant tumor cells, the quantity of ROS generation is greatly improved, resulting in higher cytotoxicity of targeted cells. Furthermore, the fiber structure of PQC NF improves long term photosensitizer retention at tumor sites which allows for comprehensive treatment with a smaller required dose. This new chemical entity has shown impressive results with a 100% cure rate in both subcutaneous and orthotopic oral cancer models with a single administered dose.",

ACM is a progressive myocardial disease characterized by fibrous and fatty deposits in the ventricular myocardium, which limit blood flow and can cause sudden death in severe cases. This sudden death syndrome has very few treatments, none of which treat the underlying condition. Currently, the only effective treatment available is an implantable defibrillator. This device can extend the life of patients, but it does pose serious risks and does nothing to treat the underlying heart muscle disease or prevent its progression.

The overall cancer death rates have been down ~20% in the past 25 years; however, mortality rates in ovarian, triple-negative breast, colon and other solid cancer patients have remained relatively unchanged in the last two decades. Cancer immunotherapy uses antibody-based approaches to activate immune cells against cancer cells and has proven effective in blood cancers and melanomas. However, most solid tumors tested for immunotherapy have been significantly discouraged compared to liquid tumors in clinical trials. The latter is attributed to 1) the limited infiltration of activated immune effector cells into the solid tumor bed, and 2) most immunotherapy agent targets one particular mechanism to eliminate cancer cells. The proposed invention focused on overcoming the latter by co-targeting the multiple cancer cell elimination mechanisms simultaneously to enhance the power of immunotherapy for solid tumor. Researchers at UC Davis have engineered a novel variant of an hCMV protein that interacts with Death Receptor DR5 and activates its clustering and apoptotic signaling. The engineered variant protein not only activates DR5 to instigate cytotoxic cell death but also mediates its action on immune checkpoint target CD155-TIGIT.

Anesthetics allow for the performance of medical operations that would otherwise cause severe pain to patients as well as create technical barriers to the performance of these operations. Current anesthetics have drawbacks, including addictive properties requiring additional regulations, environmental contamination due to low decomposition rate, and sometimes long metabolization rates causing food-producing animal products to be temporarily unfit for consumption. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed new anesthetic agents using terpenoids and salicylates that can be administered by intravenous injection in mammals. These new agents can also be used for euthanasia. Terpenoids and salicylates are naturally occurring and often aromatic compounds produced by plants and found in many foods. These compounds are generally recognized as safe (\u201cGRAS\u201d); therefore, these compounds can be used in food-producing animals without the need for meat and milk withholding times. The developed agents have low toxicity and high environmental decomposition properties, thus reducing environmental impact. This provides an advantage over current anesthetics used for euthanasia, as current anesthetics do not break down during animal rendering, potentially contaminating food webs. In addition to the benefits for food-producing animals, efficacy may likely translate to small animal practice. Analgesic efficacy may also have potential for translation to humans. Applications: Anesthetic agents for use in human and non-human animals, Euthanasia agents to use on food-producing animals.

Genetic studies have identified the key subsets of Nav channels involved in pain signaling. These subsets of Nav channels includes the channel Nav1.7. Current use of Nav channel blockers as an anesthetic is wide-spread due to their non-addictive properties and ability to inhibit Nav channels in peripheral sensory neurons. Unfortunately, current anesthetics are non-selective and block Nav channels vital for the function of the heart, muscle, and central nervous system.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method to stop bacterial growth while maintaining desirable metabolic functions for therapeutic and biotechnological applications. Recent understanding of the human microbiome has ushered in the interest in engineering bacteria or probiotics for therapeutic applications. Yet, few if any engineered bacteria have been approved by FDA for therapeutic applications. For many target applications, it is difficult to maintain the desirable characteristics and metabolic processes of bacteria while simultaneously restricting their replication in non-targeted parts of a patient and the human population at large. The existing approach to limit cellular division often involves genetically modifying bacteria, but this is a technically challenging process and does not usually generalize to non-standard bacteria. Furthermore, such genetic modification tends to induce stress on the bacteria, resulting in poor therapeutic performance. In addition, bacteria can mutate the genetic control elements, resulting in biocontainment issues. A generalizable method of limiting bacterial growth while keeping their metabolic functions is needed to translate bacterial vaccines and probiotics in clinical applications. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a non-genetic method to selectively limit cellular division. This process causes an irreversible stop of bacterial growth but still allows for the typical metabolic activity, nutrient import, protein synthesis, and motility that are desired for therapeutic applications. Additionally, the process results in cells that are robust to certain external stress factors.

CDKL5 is a gene found on the X-chromosome that is responsible for producing an essential protein for brain development and function. Mutations of this gene can lead to CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), affecting around 1 in 40,000 individuals. Symptoms typically begin in infancy and include seizures, limited motor functionality, and developmental delays. Anti-seizure medications are used to treat symptoms of the disorder, but there are currently no comprehensive treatments for CDD. Research has been conducted on small-molecule drugs to treat CDD and similar X-linked disorders through gene reactivation; however, such drugs typically cause global gene reactivation of the X-chromosome, making them unsuitable for targeted treatments. Furthermore, these treatments have limited therapeutic potential as they rely on cell proliferation to function. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a new targeted approach for preventing and treating CDD.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed an approach to improve drug delivery to tumors and metastases in the brain. Their multi-barrier tackling delivery strategy has worked to efficiently impact brain tumor management while also achieving increased survival times in anti-cancer efficacy. While treating brain tumors, the power of therapeutics is often blocked by various drug delivery barriers in the brain. These include blood-brain tumor barriers, destabilizing effects in blood circulation, and low tumor functionality. To combat these issues, researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a nano-delivery approach, more specifically referred to as the \u201cSequential Targeting in Crosslinking\u201d (STICK) strategy. As part of their approach, the researchers have developed two types of telodendrimers (structured building blocks that aid in drug delivery). The telodendrimers work to overcome the current problems of brain therapeutics as stated above. The STICK nanoplatform has increased loading capacity, greater micellar stability, and a multistage targeting approach. Experimentation in orthotopic (tissue transplant placed into its natural location) brain tumor models has proven the nanoplatform strategy to produce anti-cancer success with greater survival times. Extending the application to imaging and therapy, this invention also shows great potential in aiding drug delivery efficacy in brain tumors by use of image-guiding. In essence, the new approach shows promise in improving the management and overall survival rate of brain tumor patients. Applications: Use in improved drug delivery approaches to treat brain tumors, New therapeutics to combat drug delivery barriers in the brain, Potential use in image-guided drug delivery. Features/Benefits: All building blocks for nano-approach (including telodendrimers) are non-toxic, Increased anti-cancer efficacy with 2x survival time, Improved management/survival of brain tumor patients, Drug properties can be optimized for various drug types, High efficiency in tackling physiological barriers, improving overall drug delivery process.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed synthetic biochemical compounds that capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or sources such as power plants. These new derivatives mimic how some plants capture carbon dioxide from the air and use it for photosynthesis. In the biological field, C4 plants are a specific type of plant where the acquired carbon dioxide is first fixed into a four-carbon atom compound. Subsequently, the carbon dioxide enters and is involved in various photosynthetic processes. These C4 plants use phosphoenolpyruvate, a chemical compound derivative of phosphoenolpyruvic acid, to capture carbon dioxide at night from the atmosphere and then release it during the day for photosynthesis. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed new phosphoenol derivatives that can capture carbon dioxide from industrial sources such as power plants before it enters the atmosphere or from the atmosphere itself. Applications: Useful in industries with major carbon dioxide emissions, Natural gas processing, Fossil fuel-based hydrogen production plants, Use in synthetic fuel plants. Features/Benefits: Contains no nitrogen; non-toxic, Less energy intensive than current solvents for carbon capture, Compounds will not be lost to atmosphere or react to form toxic compounds.",

Infant Bifidobacterium strains can metabolize human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), while the variety found in adults can only ferment oligosaccharides found in plants. Breast-fed infants are unique as they have the proper gut microbiome to process human milk. These bacteria have been widely studied in order to replicate their effects, but there can be manufacturing difficulties in growing these infant-derived strains effectively. Further research is needed in order to identify novel probiotics that mimic the functional effects of infant-borne Bifidobacterium in situ, but can also be grown at a commercial scale. Researchers at the University of California Davis have isolated a strain of Bifidobacterium that can be used as a probiotic to enrich the diets for both breast-fed and formula-fed infants. Such probiotic strains are useful when weaning and adjusting an infant\u2019s diet to solid foods, as well as when an infant\u2019s diet is supplemented with formula. The new strain has a more robust growth and novel activation of key catabolic pathways compared to other Bifidobacterium, furthering its dietary benefits. The new strain can grow better than existing Bifidobacterial strains, and it is more commercially viable to produce in large quantities. In the future, this new strain can be included with a mixture of other probiotics without disruption. This research can be applied to improve infant health and nutrition during an essential phase of development.",

One of the most common types of Bifidobacterium is B. breve.

The addition of bacteria that can break down sialic acid to infant probiotics would improve nutrition during weaning.\n\nResearchers at the University of California Davis have isolated B. breve strains that grow on sialyl-lactose and BMO and can be added to probiotic supplements for infants. These unique strains contain a gene for sialidase that in turn can metabolize sialic acid found in sialyl-HMO and BMO, facilitating the metabolization of a variety of oligosaccharides contained in human milk and infant formula. Enhanced metabolization of multiple sugar groups leads to higher nutritional utilization and improves digestion. To supplement their nutritional needs during weaning, these strains can be implemented in probiotics for both breast-fed infants and formula-fed infants.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have developed a novel approach of identifying sepsis by employing custom machine learning models within a combination of known laboratory data. Current methods for detecting sepsis in patients rely on physician gestalt (which may be flawed), non-specific systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, and biomarkers. For example, the SIRS criteria may be met if a patient exhibits fever, has a rapid respiratory rate, has a high heart rate, and/or has abnormally high or low white blood cell counts. As a result, a healthy person can manifest SIRS just by exercising. Sepsis is defined as SIRS with a suspected or identified source of infection. Unfortunately, infection is difficult to detect in a timely fashion using existing microbiological techniques, often taking 24-48 hours to provide definitive results. As a result, sepsis recognition may be delayed, contributing to its increased mortality \u2013 reported to be as high as 50% in some instances. Due to these limitations, sepsis recognition is delayed and contributing to increased mortality which has been reported to be as high as 50%. Using customized AI/ML techniques, UC Davis researchers have developed a robust system for differentiating between sepsis and non-sepsis conditions using a combination of known laboratory and vital signs data such as heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure and additional parameters such as the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS). Applications include prediction of sepsis rapidly without waiting for pathogen identification. Features/Benefits include being able to adequately predict sepsis with less variables compared to those recommended in consensus guidelines. The method empirically generates thousands of models within a multitude of algorithms which enables to find the best performing model. It is constructed through a series of variations in its hyperparameter settings which include variable activation functions, variable hidden layer depths, and variable alpha values.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "A researcher at the University of California, Davis has developed a safety scalpel for mitigating the challenges associated with the removal of certain types of percutaneous implants, such as gastrostomy tubes having difficult to reduce anchoring elements. A percutaneous implant is an object foreign to the body that is placed through the skin and other tissue to create a permanent or semi-permanent pathway or port through the skin into the body. An example of a percutaneous implant is a gastrostomy tube, which typically has an anchoring element that is positioned within the stomach to prevent inadvertent removal. The anchoring element may be comprised of an inflatable balloon, a reducible flange, a pigtail or loop mechanism, or a difficult to reduce radially extending flange. A difficult to reduce anchoring element can present challenges when the time comes for tube removal. A conventional method for removal, traction per the IFU, is associated with tearing along the stoma tract, pain, bleeding, and site infection. Accordingly, there is a need for improved tools and methods for removing gastrostomy tubes and other types of percutaneous implants. An alternate method of removing a gastrostomy tube, often referred to as the \u201ccut and push\u201d method, involves severing a portion of the gastrostomy tube outside of the body and pushing a remainder of the gastrostomy tube into the stomach, in the hopes that this portion of the gastrostomy tube, which includes the anchoring element, passes naturally through the patient\u2019s gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This method involves a risk that the gastrostomy tube does not pass naturally and creates an obstruction in and/or perforates the GI tract and/or has other undesirable effects. In response to this need, a researcher at the University of California, Davis has developed a novel device that mitigates the aforementioned challenges, especially with respect to the removal of mushroom-type gastrostomy tubes. In particular, the device allows for safe fractionation of the tube without embolization of the fractionated pieces. The device is configured in such a way that permits blade(s) to cut the tube without injuring adjacent tissue. Either sharp or blunt (i.e., with an alternate method of energy delivery) blades may be used. The device may also be used in conjunction with a guidewire for passage of the device into a stoma tract. Applications: Removal of percutaneous implants such as mushroom-type gastrostomy tubes. Features/Benefits: Reduced incidence of complications (e.g., bleeding, tissue trauma) associated with gastrostomy tube removal. Reduced procedure time for gastrostomy tube removal.",

    "ip_number": "Tech ID: 32672 / UC Case 2022-505-0",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "P-selectin is a protein found on the surface of blood vessels and blood platelets. It brings a supply of white blood cells and platelets to inflammation and injury sites through intercellular signaling. This process also indirectly provides growth factors for cancer tumors to metastasize with the fresh supply of blood cells and circulation via inflammation. Due to these properties, P-selectin is currently a target for experimental anticancer drugs. Further study of the cellular interactions it\u2019s involved with is necessary to advance this field of research and drug discovery. Researchers at the University of California Davis have found that P-selectin and integrin binding may be a potential target for anticancer and anti-inflammation drugs. Through molecular docking simulations, researchers have found that P-selectin binds directly to a variety of integrins, or receptors on the surface of a cell that helps bind it to other cells. This is the first report of P-selectin and integrin binding, which could revolutionize its role in medicine. A mutation made near the integrin binding site of P-selectin puts it in an inactive state and disrupts carbohydrate binding. In turn, this reduces its ability to generate inflammation, and could even slow cancer metastasis. With a reduced blood supply to the tumor, it becomes more difficult for the tumor to spread and grow. For these reasons, it is believed that P-selectin-integrin binding could be a new target for inflammation and cancer inhibitors. Applications: Target for new anti-inflammation and anti-cancer drugs, Identification of inflammatory modulator. Features/Benefits: First analysis of P-selectin and integrin binding.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Sepsis is responsible for 1 in 5 deaths worldwide and has a mortality rate of around 30% depending on its severity. It occurs when the body suffers a severe chain reaction to an infection which damages major organ groups. The typical treatment for sepsis is nonspecific and may include general antibiotics, administering fluids, and blood pressure medication, all of which treat the symptoms of the disease rather than the biomechanism that is directly responsible. Myeloid Differentiation factor 2 (MD-2) binds to Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to form the LPS-MD-2-TLR4 complex. This complex is involved in TLR4 and MD-2 signaling, which play a role in generating inflammatory responses as well as general immune responses. In addition, the binding between MD-2 and integrins is also crucial for signaling to occur. Despite its clear role in the immune system and inflammation, MD2 has not been studied as a target in drug discovery. There is still an unmet need for novel drugs to treat inflammatory and infectious diseases, particularly in the developing world where they are the most widespread. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a method of modulating the activity of MD-2-integrin interactions as a possible treatment for sepsis. Using molecular docking simulations, several MD-2 mutants were identified that don\u2019t interact with integrins and can disrupt the signaling of TLR4 and MD-2, effectively altering the immune response and reducing inflammation throughout the body. This slows the effects of sepsis and is an effective therapeutic treatment. It is possible to administer these mutated MD-2 proteins to modulate MD-2 signaling and inflammation. In addition to sepsis, MD-2 mutants can potentially be used to treat several other inflammatory diseases. This research may influence drug discovery and can be used as a target for drug delivery in the future.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a large area sensor array for ultrasound imaging systems that utilizes high-bandwidth piezoelectric sensors and modular design elements. Ultrasound sensing is utilized in a number of industries and applications, but it is most well-known for its role in medical imaging. Ultrasound is one of the safest medical imaging techniques currently available, since it doesn\u2019t emit radiation and is typically non-invasive. However, compared to other imaging techniques, ultrasound lacks in resolution and fine detail. Recent advancements have been made in beamforming algorithms, signal processing, and other associated ASICs for ultrasound imaging systems; thus, the new difficulty of creating high fidelity ultrasound systems involves connecting capable high-resolution sensors to these advanced circuits. There are many manufacturing challenges with designing dense arrays of sensors and integrating them with ASICs without compromises. Existing approaches are generally difficult and costly to manufacture, rely on flexible circuit boards that cause undesirable parasitic capacitance, feature poor acoustic performance, force restrictions of available ASIC sizes, or require dedicated fabrication lines for certain components. There is a need to integrate new ultrasound processing electronics with capable sensing arrays using a new, feasible manufacturing technique to make widespread adoption possible. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a method of integrating modular arrays of piezoelectric ultrasound sensors with high-bandwidth ASICs for beamforming and signal processing. Multiple independent sub-array modules, consisting of piezoelectric sensors and associated interface electronics, are combined to form a unified large area array, thereby improving the production yield and manufacturing costs while solving other existing issues of ultrasound imaging systems. This design allows for high-bandwidth, large-resolution sensors to integrate seamlessly with advanced ASICs and other electronics in a convenient form factor. Bandwidth limitations are solved with the number of raw data channels available for advanced beamforming algorithms, which also allows for a large dynamic range. The modular design approach makes the physical layout of the system highly versatile, with the possibility of both flat and curved array options. Ultimately, the versatility of this system - in both in the design and manufacturing stages \u2013 may contribute to sophisticated ultrasound imaging systems.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a small device that attaches directly to the hub of a tracheostomy tube and enables the monitoring of respiratory function in tracheostomy patients during sleep studies. Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that may be performed by creating an opening on the anterior side of a patient\u2019s neck, bypassing the upper airway and providing direct access to the trachea. Tracheostomy patients may encounter sleep disorders similar to non-tracheostomy patients. Non-tracheostomy patients encountering sleep disorders may be subjects of a sleep study, for example polysomnography. During a sleep study, a non-tracheostomy patient\u2019s respiratory function may be monitored using a nasal cannula inserted into the patient\u2019s nostrils. However, since tracheostomy patients have limited or no respiratory airflow through the nostrils, a nasal cannula cannot be used to monitor respiratory function. Accordingly, there has been a need to find a way to monitor the respiratory function of tracheostomy patients during sleep studies. To address this need, researchers at UC Davis have developed a heat moisture exchanger (HME) system that attaches directly to the hub of a tracheostomy tube and enables the collection of data during a polysomnogram. The device allows for end-tidal carbon dioxide and inhalation/exhalation airflow measurements, and can be used to deliver supplemental oxygen. This device also allows access for suctioning of airway secretions, and provides other benefits of HMEs.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a comfortable method for compiling accurate, real-time, imaging data for heart and breathing without requiring additional external monitoring devices. Photon imaging modalities - including positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) - are increasingly important both as diagnostic methods and for monitoring the progression of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory system function, and musculoskeletal disorders. However, image quality degradation can result from patient movements that often occur during conventional scanning techniques. This image degradation leads to reduced detection of clinically relevant medical conditions. Various methods exist to correct for these movements. However, additional devices or equipment (such as ECG, breathing belts, or optical markers) are often then required \u2013 making compiling a comprehensive view of the patient\u2019s condition more difficult and complex. Thus, new models for capturing and curating large volumes of diagnostic data are needed. A process for extracting critical, cardiac and respiratory gating signals via real-time manipulation of raw data gathered via either PET or SPECT imaging has been validated. High temporal resolution has been achieved while minimizing patient discomfort. This technique is superior to current data-driven methods because of its flexibility to generate cardiorespiratory signals in real-time.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed several blockchain paradigms that provide new approaches and expand on existing protocols to improve performance in large-scale blockchain implementations. Blockchain is an increasingly popular technology for secure, federated databases due to the transparency and security it provides. Numerous parties validate transactions on a public ledger, creating a decentralized, consensus-based system; this approach is advantageous as it can function even if some users are inactive or have local errors. However, existing blockchain protocols have limitations of their own, especially at larger scales. For example, in primary-backup systems the total transaction throughput is limited by the bandwidth of the primary machine as it is the only one capable of providing new transactions before they are sent to the rest of the network. In other cases, the total network capability is not fully utilized since many operations cannot be effectively ran in parallel, so some machines sit idle waiting for other tasks to complete. There is also difficulty in scaling large databases since a copy of the entire ledger must be sent to every member of the network, which could add a delay with insufficient bandwidth. This problem is especially apparent when users are located in entirely different geographic regions. Since blockchain technology is becoming more sophisticated, it is important to meet these challenges with new protocols that are future-proof and scalable for growing needs. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a series of new protocols to address such limitations and improve the performance, reliability, and security of blockchain technologies. There are three distinct advancements, each solving a unique challenge of modern blockchain implementations. 2022-503 RCC: Resilient Concurrent Consensus - In the RCC paradigm, replica machines can independently provide transactions without the single replica bandwidth bottleneck of primary-backup systems. Transaction throughput is improved by running many consensus instances concurrently to use the entire network as efficiently as possible. Through RCC, existing primary-backup systems can easily transition into a concurrent consensus structure. Furthermore, RCC is more reliable as it reduces the coordination dependency between systems. This structure is fault resilient and provides up to a 2.75x performance improvement to transaction throughput. 2022-502 ByShard - ByShard is capable of implementing shard protocols in a Byzantine environment. Blockchain Shards make scaling to large datasets possible by splitting data into smaller partitions that are shared between centrally located clusters \u2013 for instance, users in the same geographical region may operate on the same partition. It reduces overhead by allowing individual nodes to process and transmit manageable sizes of data, and improves total throughput by processing shard transactions in parallel. This versatile technology includes 18 novel protocols, each with their own trade-offs between throughput, isolation level, latency, and abort rate. 2022-501 Ring Byzantine Fault Tolerance \u2013 Existing shard protocols are efficient when working within a single cluster, but have severe performance penalties when accessing data from other nodes. RingBFT manages conflicts and resolves deadlocks by requiring cross-shard transactions to occur in a linear ring order, offering significant performance improvements. The ring method of processing, forwarding, and re-transmitting information to neighboring nodes improves throughput by up to 25x, and can be scaled up to 500 nodes. 2022-513 Power-of-Collaboration (PoC) Hybrid Protocol - PoC is a hybrid protocol that leverages elements from BFT (Byzantine Fault-tolerant Protocol), PoS (Proof-of-Stake), and PoW (Proof-of-Work) protocols. PoC aims to leverage the resiliency and reconfigurability of PoW, utilizing the PoS-like penalty model, and the democratic and voting model of BFT. The PoC protocol utilizes the power of BFT protocol to substantially reduce the energy consumption needed to solve PoW computational puzzles without weakening its resiliency promise. Furthermore, by incorporating PoS, a new fair economical model is developed such that it only penalizes misbehavior while providing consistent fair rewards to all participating miners.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed de novo positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) that bind to TRPV1 proteins involved with pain-sensing in order to provide analgesic effects. TRPV1 is an ion channel receptor that is largely responsible for sensing and regulating body temperature in organisms; it also plays a role in sensing pain and may exacerbate chronic pain symptoms in some individuals. Hence, research has been conducted on analgesic drugs that can deactivate TRPV1 in order to provide pain relief. However, this protein is critical for temperature regulation and thus treatments that entirely block TRPV1 activity may lead to hyperthermia and other serious side effects. Furthermore, the methods currently used to accomplish this task often make such treatments irreversible. Further refinements to this approach may fill an unmet need for novel analgesics that can effectively treat chronic pain without the adverse effects associated with opioids and other drugs. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed de-novo positive allosteric modulator (PAM) peptides that bind to TRPV1 and provide long lasting pain relief. These PAMs bind to the ankyrin-repeat domain (ARD) of TRPV1 with nanomolar affinity in order to selectively modulate channel activity and achieve desired cellular effects. This technique overloads a localized area with calcium, causing nerve endings to temporarily become less sensitive to create an analgesic effect. In studies with rats, these de novo PAMs were shown to provide long lasting pain relief without affecting their body temperature, indicating a major breakthrough in therapeutic potential. This discovery has potential for future use as an analgesic for humans and animals such as pets and could prove useful in treating chronic pain. Applications: Use in analgesics specifically designed to treat chronic pain without addition side-effect, Selective modulation of TRPV1 ion receptor. Features/Benefits: In silico designed and fully validated at molecular, cellular and animal levels, Pain relief lasts more than 3 times longer than previous control trial, with reduced side effects, Robust protein binding and affinity, Treatment is fully reversible, Affect only TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method of estimating blood plasma water content using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry. A large number of medical decisions are based on blood chemistry assays. The accuracy of blood tests can depend on plasma water content (\u201cPWC\u201d), which is not typically measured in clinical laboratories. The current standard method for measuring PWC, lyophilization, requires approximately 24 hours of elapsed time. Such delays can add increased patient risk when a large lab is processing thousands of samples daily and be unacceptable in situations that require urgent treatment decisions. Blood test results are thus frequently based on an \u201cassumed,\u201d standard value of 93% PWC. However, variance in PWC between patients can influence many test results \u2013 including blood electrolyte and metabolite tests. Thus, the development of a rapid test to measure PWC would provide clinicians with a means to improve the accuracy of blood chemistry assays and diagnostic tests - improving patient care. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method of estimating blood PWC using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry. This method consists of placing samples in an NMR spectrometer and correlating the decay constants to the percentage of water in plasma samples. Researchers have conducted tests on animal plasma samples and achieved 98+% PWC prediction accuracy - which matches the accuracy of current, standard lyophilization-based techniques. The NMR-based test can help clinicians improve the accuracy of blood chemistry assays and diagnostic tests. Additionally, NMR only requires a small amount of sample (1-2mL), while most tests require a considerably greater volume of blood. NMR is also non-destructive, meaning that the same blood sample can also be used for other subsequent lab tests.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed an optical transceiver that uses compressive sensing to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve signal resolution. In communication systems, transceivers are used to send and receive information, commonly through optical fibers for high-frequency signals. Optical transceivers typically have bandwidth requirements that are proportional to Nyquist sampling rates of the data being captured, meaning that in high frequency applications the bandwidth requirements are substantial. This tradeoff creates an information bottleneck, limiting the performance and speed of other components in the system. An optical transceiver with the ability to compress data in some manner would greatly simplify applications in high-frequency signal processing and communication systems. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a high-speed optical transceiver that uses compressive sensing to reduce bandwidth requirements by orders of magnitude. Signals processed by transceivers are typically sparse in the time-frequency domain; via compressive sensing, they can be accurately reconstructed using less samples than what is usually necessary. Compressive sensing allows the transceiver to operate at very high frequencies while using the same bandwidth as typical optical transceivers. Such a device can be implemented for analog-to-digital (ADC) signal conversion, and could significantly improve bandwidth and signal resolution by encoding more than 10 times the equivalent number of bits as existing transceivers. This is accomplished by spectral splicing of the signal on several devices operating in parallel, using a stable frequency comb as reference. This technology could offer significant improvements in the speed and performance of analog and digital signal processing. Applications: High frequency signal processing, High performance photonic analog-to-digital (ADC) conversion in THz frequency range. Features/Benefits: Reduced bandwidth requirements and improved signal resolution, Low noise.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a heat exchanger produced by additive manufacturing that operates with high efficiency under high pressure and temperature conditions. Heat exchangers often operate under extreme conditions in large-scale applications. However, exchangers operating at very high temperatures can undergo accelerated corrosion and material fatigue. Similarly, exchangers operating at extreme pressures require increased material thicknesses, increasing production costs. Expensive metal alloys have been introduced for exchangers operating in extreme environments. But, this solution both raises production costs and can lead to lower exchanger thermal conductivity in many applications. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a counter-flow heat exchanger capable of operating under extreme conditions. The exchanger is fabricated using additive manufacturing. It includes an array of microscale pins on both the hot and cold sides of the exchanger \u2013 which promotes higher heat transfer rates. This exchanger can be produced through the use of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and metallic, 3D printing techniques. It has been tested at temperatures up to 800 degrees C and pressures over 200 bar, and has an estimated operating life of 40,000 hours. The combination of lower fabrication costs and its effectiveness in high temperature/high pressure operating environments exceeds other options available currently. Applications: A wide range of manufacturing and industrial processes operating at extreme conditions. Features/Benefits: Relatively low manufacturing costs via use of additive manufacturing techniques, Offers high-efficiency heat transfer, Size of exchanger can be scaled readily given its fabrication technique.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed methods for creating compositions with the potential to prevent or treat cancer or metabolic diseases. These compositions combine conjugates with covalently linked HDAC inhibitors and retinoids. Despite steady therapy advances, cancer remains a prominent global disease. Furthermore, metabolic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) also pose prominent threats to health worldwide. Thus, there is a need for new treatments for both cancer and various metabolic diseases. Previous research has shown that the combination of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and retinoids can be effective treatments for cancer and metabolic diseases. However, synthetic HDAC inhibitors such as suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA) have toxicity concerns, and natural gut bacteria-generated HDAC inhibitors such as butyrate have low bioavailability due to their rapid metabolism and clearance. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed compositions comprising conjugates with a polymeric backbone and covalently linked HDAC inhibitors and retinoids. These compositions have documented benefits in the treatment or prevention of cancer or metabolic diseases, particularly in colon and liver tissue. In contrast to the therapeutic shortcomings of individual drugs such as butyrate and retinoic acid (RA), the conjugates developed assemble into nanomicelles and release HDAC inhibitors and retinoids through slow hydrolysis, resulting in long-lasting efficacy. Moreover, the conjugates are orally deliverable, which is preferred by patients and much more cost-effective in low-resource settings (oral administration saves dispending and administration costs). The present formulations are effective in both the colon and the liver, and thus can be used for both colon and liver cancer, as well as metabolic disease associated with both organs. Applications: Potential treatments for cancer or metabolic diseases. Features/Benefits: Orally deliverable and non-odorous, Therapeutics are released simultaneously to have interactive effects, Retain individual as well as combined effects of retinoic acid and HDAC inhibitors, Based on the pathology or disease, the molar ratio of RA to short-chain fatty acids can be altered to optimize the desired clinical effects.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a device that allows needles to be reliably and easily bent to a range of specified and reproducible angles. The device also enables protection of the needle tip and the maintenance of needle sterility during bending. Bending a needle or other medical or surgical instrument in a point-of-care setting or other point-of-use setting can involve certain challenges. If a user must manually bend the instrument in their hands, it may be difficult to form a bend having the necessarily precise angle or curvature and/or to create multiple bends having uniform angles and/or curvatures. A purely manual technique tends to be slow, inefficient, and increased handling could raise the risk of compromising the sterility or aseptic condition of the instrument. In the case of bending a hollow needle, a user may inadvertently crush the lumen of the needle, blunt the tip of the needle, and/or cause other structural damage as a result of applying excessive force to the needle. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a medical/surgical instrument-bending device that overcomes the aforementioned challenges. The device is comprised of a handle and a head which serves as a bending die. The head contains a groove, an arch, and a slide slot. A needle/surgical instrument is then bent by being passed through the head\u2019s side slot till it is underneath the arch, then rolling the device along the needle. A series or markings allows specified and precise angles to be reliably reproduced. An estimated 8 million procedures are performed in the US annually that could be improved by this device. Other advantages of the device include the ability to bend a needle/surgical instrument at any desired point along its length, protect the tip of the needle, and maintain instrument sterility. Applications: Any medical/surgical procedure that requires bending of a needle (e.g., spinal, joint, musculoskeletal procedures), Allows physicians/surgeons to avoid damaging of vulnerable structures, such as nerves and blood vessels, with a needle when performing a procedure. Features/Benefits: Improvement to an estimated 8 million procedures annually in the US, Improved specificity and reproducibility in bend geometry, Allows protection of needle tip, Bend(s) can be induced anywhere along length of needle, Usability in sterile clinical environments, Inexpensive to manufacture, No FDA approval required.",

The system has comparable cooling efficiency to traditional ice and drastically reduces water consumption, prevents potential microbial cross-contamination caused by melt-water, and eliminates the use of plastic and other synthetic materials. Food and pharmaceutical supply and delivery chains require temperature control during sourcing, processing, handling, distribution, transportation, and sale. Although traditional ice and reusable plastic bagged coolants are affordable and efficient, concerns arise from the microbial cross-contamination caused by melted water, intensive use of water and the use of synthetic materials in reusable coolants. In addition, the loss of coolant life due to the growth of molds inside the reusable coolant packs and cubes after several uses makes reusable coolants less attractive to customers. Most importantly, the thick plastic shells in the bagged coolants could decrease cooling efficiency and generate negative impacts on the environment. Materials developed are safe to be directly applied on and in contact with food. The system has comparable cooling efficiency to traditional ice, can be processed into varied sizes and shapes, can drastically reduce melt-water-caused microbial cross-contamination potential, prevent the product-life loss due to fungal-growth, and avoid potential pollutions caused by the use of plastic bags and synthetic contents. The application of this system has the potential to bring immediate benefits to the food and pharmaceutical industry, shipping companies, as well as coolant production companies by reducing microbial contamination of cooled foods and items, minimizing water consumption, and eliminating potential pollutions by synthetic coolants. Applications: Perishable food transport and delivery, Pharmaceutical and temperature sensitive material delivery, Seafood and meat storage, sales, and display, Farm-market-home temperature controlling, Restaurant take-out and catering services.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed machine learning models to enhance the accessibility and accuracy of acute kidney injury (AKI) testing. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication among critically ill patients. Severely burned patients, in particular, are at high-risk - with up to 58% experiencing AKI. From a laboratory regulatory perspective, AKI testing is currently classified as moderately complex. This classification requires expert knowledge to interpret test results, limiting who is able to operate testing devices bedside. Moreover, traditional biomarkers of renal function such as creatinine and urine output (UOP) have been shown to be inadequate at predicting AKI because of factors such as naturally high biological variability. Novel AKI biomarkers have also been proposed, but their widespread use in the United States remains limited. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed machine learning (ML) models using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm - a common algorithm used in neural networks for pattern recognition and classification - to enhance the accessibility and accuracy of AKI testing. This approach eliminates the need for specific medical personnel to be at the bedside, while still allowing device operators to assess potential AKI. The ML models take a combination of known laboratory data and apply algorithms to generate predictive models faster than traditional AKI testing methods. These models could identify patients at risk of AKI while reducing potential for human error. Ultimately, this technology could expand accessibility of AKI testing and enhance patient care. Applications: Enhanced accessibility and accuracy of AKI testing. Features/Benefits: Does not require highly-trained specialists at patient bedside, Can accept varying inputs, including both traditional and novel AKI biomarkers, Faster than existing AKI testing methods (such as KDIGO guidelines), Minimizes the likelihood of human error.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a highly efficient microchannel polymer heat exchanger in a compact and lightweight design. Heat exchangers are commonly used for heating, cooling, and refrigeration applications. Their basic function is to transfer heat from one fluid to another, often with the aid of a refrigerant. Most refrigerants are kept in sealed compartments and an additional fluid (typically water) acts as an intermediary transfer between the refrigerant and the fluid being heated or cooled by the heat exchanger. In modern tube-fin heat exchangers a fluid is pumped through metal tube coils and the heat is dissipated through a large collection of fins. This design is not very efficient, as it requires powerful flow across a large volume of fins to effectively transfer heat. Further, the amount of metal needed in this tube design can be expensive to manufacture. A powerful pump is also necessary to compensate for pressure drops throughout the tubes, which is an inefficient use of power. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed low-cost, plastic microchannel heat exchangers with superior thermal efficiency. Instead of large metal tube coils, this design features a thin-walled plastic piping network. The surface area in contact with the fluid is thereby substantially increased per fluid volume in this design. The increased surface area contact not only increases the thermal exchange of the system, but also negates the need for a large fan and pump, thus saving additional power and manufacturing costs. The lightweight, chemically-resistant plastic body possibly has a lower manufacturing cost and can be used in a variety of heating, cooling, and refrigeration applications. This novel design is especially promising for cooling single-family and multi-family residences, where it is more efficient compared to finned-tube heat exchangers. Applications: Chilled fluid distributed heating and cooling, Centralized heater or chiller systems. Features/Benefits: Possible manufacturing cost savings by using: 3-D printing or injection molding instead of more complex metal tube coil manufacturing, Smaller fan and pump compared to conventional design, Polymers instead of heavy and expensive metals. More efficient performance: Increased heat transfer compared to conventional metal finned-tube heat exchangers.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a reconfigurable radiator array that produces a high frequency directed beam via uninterrupted, scalable, electronic beam steering. Data transmission and scanning applications would both benefit from the potential opportunities inherent in the use of very high frequency electromagnetic wavelengths. Faster and larger data transfers and higher-resolution imaging could provide advantages ranging from improved mobile phone reception to the more rigorous screening of humans and objects for national security purposes. However, capturing the advantages of terahertz frequency electromagnetic waves has proven problematic historically. Concerns range from high power consumption requirements to the loss of resolution and \u201cblind spots\u201d that can occur during transmission. Options developed to address these concerns \u2013 including the use of directed beams or larger lenses \u2013 all have their own limitations. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have overcome many historical concerns by coupling lens-integrated, reconfigurable, radiating, individual light beams into a reconfigurable array structure. This array structure can perform continuous, uninterrupted and scalable electronic beam steering with high directivity in a lens-coupled source array. The technology combines two, different, methods of beam steering: antenna displacement and phase shifting. The result is lower power functionality with both high directivity and fine scanning resolution. The technology includes a silicon wafer with an integrated array of pixel sources comprising unit cells. Each unit cell in the integrated array comprises a standing wave oscillator (SWO), but is coupled to neighboring unit cells in both horizontal and vertical directions. This configuration makes it possible to turn individual unit cells on and off, thus creating phase shifts between the adjacent unit cells. As a result, a directed beam can be steered to cover a blind spot between adjacent beams produced by the unit cells. Furthermore, the technology is capable of multi-beam/frequency radiation by simultaneous activation of subarrays without intersecting corners. This method of beam steering using a reconfigurable array in a lens-coupled source can also be generalized and employed in other settings. Thus, this technology is applicable at both different frequencies and with other types of unit cell sources. This method of beam steering can also be used in different types of wireless systems, but is particularly well suited for applications such as high-resolution imaging. Applications: Imaging systems, Next-generation voice and data transmission. Features/Benefits: Achieves narrow beams, resulting in high resolution, Minimizes interference and signal loss, Uses significantly less power compared to alternate approaches for terahertz applications.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a programmable machine that shakes and repeatedly inverts large numbers of small containers - such as vials and flasks \u2013 in order to mix high-viscosity fluids. Many medical applications require the thorough mixing of fluids before those samples undergo further testing or processing. For example, many diagnostic tests used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus or other pathogens require shaking and inverting samples before they are processed. Such procedures are often performed manually, which can lead to inconsistent mixing and could affect the accuracy of test results. Manual processing is also time consuming - and can become a rate-limiting step during large testing operations. For high-viscosity fluids, it is particularly important to shake and invert samples to ensure their thorough mixing. However, this critical function is not present currently in most commercially available equipment designed for high-throughput applications. Thus, new equipment capable of mixing large numbers of small-volume samples simultaneously would improve the efficiency of many processes associated with the medical, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a machine that can automate the thorough mixing of samples using a programmable sequence of steps. Many samples can be loaded onto trays and inserted into the machine. In one configuration, each tray can hold up to 96 samples, and the machine can hold up to eight trays. Because the machine is programmable, its operating characteristics can be customized to the specific fluid(s) being mixed. Parameters such as shaking duration, inversion frequency and length can be set using a microcontroller. The amplitude can be adjusted manually. The machine can also be modified to hold other types of containers such as cans or sealed flasks. This technology can facilitate the processing of high volumes of COVID-19 diagnostic samples, as well as samples collected for a variety of other clinical, R&D, or industrial applications. Applications: Rapid mixing of small volume, high-throughput, samples of high viscosity liquids; Mixing large numbers of saliva samples prior to testing.

Unfortunately, existing methods for intraluminal structure imaging, such as a gradient index lens or an angle-polished ball lens, are ineffective and unreliable. A method for combining fluorescence lifetime imaging and optical coherence tomography would greatly improve imaging capabilities for intraluminal structures. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have designed a multimodal intravascular catheter that enables combined fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The catheter consists of a motor drive that performs fluorescence detection and sends the fluorescence signal to a console for data processing and display. This process results in a simplification of the hardware because there is no need to couple the fluorescent light back into a fiber optic, causing a reduction in optical losses and an improvement in FLIm signal quality.

Gene expression is widely recognized as a contributing factor in a variety of diseases. Epigenetic editing to correct the expression of disease-relevant genes within live cells has become an important therapeutic approach. Relatedly, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques and the use of fusion proteins targeted by catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) for epigenetic editing offer promising therapeutic opportunities. However, these approaches can be hampered by packaging size limitations when using viruses such as adeno-associated virus (AAV) for delivery. As such, there is a need for improved epigenetic editing systems and methods of delivery to target cells. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a new epigenetic editing system that employs a \u201csplit\u201d approach to overcome virus packaging size limitations and allow delivery of, for example, a large fusion protein (e.g., that comprises a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein and an epigenetic modifier domain) to target cells via an AAV delivery system.

Polynucleotides that encode guide RNA (gRNA) can be included in the same two capsid(s), or can be delivered in parallel using additional capsid(s). Editing can be multiplexed through the use of gRNA-tRNA arrays. The system has been demonstrated in vitro to regulate gene expression and alter epigenetic states.

O-Acetyl modifications of sialic acids affect the key roles that sialic acids play in biological and pathological processes including immunology, oncology, virology, and neuroscience. However, these modifications are unstable and can be hydrolyzed easily by pH changes or the presence of esterases. This lability of sialic acid O-acetylation has hindered its functional study and application. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed an efficient method to construct a library of glycans containing sialic acids with one or more N-acetyl groups as mimics of those containing the natural occurring O-acetyl sialic acids. Glycans containing azido derivatives of legionaminic acid and sialic acids have also been produced. Molecular dynamic simulations proved that the glycans containing N-acetyl sialic acids have comparable conformation and flexibility to those containing O-acetyl sialic acids. Due to this similarity, sialic acids with N-acetylation can both be recognized and taken up by cells while also being more resistant to hydrolysis.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed an integrated virtual reality and audiovisual support system that increases the comfort of patients who are undergoing diagnostic tests or medical procedures in the prone and other positions. Display systems such as virtual reality headsets have grown in popularity in recent years \u2013 in part because of their ability to allow users to experience a calming, immersive environment. Such devices are especially helpful to distract conscious patients undergoing extended diagnostic tests or medical procedures. However, the ancillary electronics related to these devices often require bulky or cumbersome systems that do not facilitate patient comfort or support. Additionally, a person undergoing such a procedure may be partially sedated or in a weakened state due to an illness or other medical condition - thereby further complicating the ability of that patient to use a head-mounted display. The use of such devices is especially limiting for procedures that require patients to maintain a prone position. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a display device that allows for immersive audiovisual distraction for patients in prone positions. The system integrates an audiovisual virtual reality headset with supportive positioning equipment to provide head, torso, or other support to patients. The combination of the supportive equipment and the display increases patient comfort while reducing their anxiety. Applications: Provides a comfortable, effective solution for prone medical procedures. Integrates with a virtual reality audiovisual display to reduce patient anxiety. Features/Benefits: Provides superior comfort and safety compared to other currently available systems.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have developed an environmentally friendly one-pot multienzyme (OPME) method for synthesizing sialidase reagents, probes, and inhibitors. Microbial sialidases (enzymes that catalyze the removal of terminal sialic acid resides) are important anti-viral and anti-bacterial drug targets. Specifically, designing and synthesizing sialidase inhibitors such as 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-sialic acids (Sia2ens) and their derivatives have been actively pursued. In addition, 2,7-anhydro-sialic acids and their derivatives can be novel compounds to modulate gut microbiota. However, current methods to synthesize such compounds require the use of toxic chemicals and solvents for multiple protection and deprotection steps. Thus, new methods for preparing Sia2en-based sialidase inhibitors and 2,7-anhydro-sialic acids are needed. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed an enzymatic method for synthesizing Sia2ens and 2,7-anhydro-sialic acids which are sialidase inhibitors, reagents and probes. The OPME method removes the need for multiple protection and deprotection steps. This method has been used to create a library of Sia2ens and 2,7-anhydro-sialic acids from the six-carbon precursors of sialic acids. A streamlined purification process has also been developed. The synthesis and the purification use only methanol and water as solvents. This technology provides efficient enzymatic methods to access useful sialidase inhibitors, potential gut microbiota modulators, and reagents and probes in an environmentally friendly manner. Applications include selective sialidase inhibitors, reagents and probes, anti-viral and anti-bacterial drugs, and prebiotics. Features/Benefits include direct synthesis of inhibitors from sialic acid derivatives and their six-carbon precursors, compounds can be further derived at various positions and can be readily converted stereo-specifically, yields a fast and efficient library of sialidase inhibitors, does not require multiple protection methods, and environmentally friendly synthesis and purification processes.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have produced continuous, sheath-core, coaxial fibers with highly porous, nanocellulose, aerogel cores for use as high-performance insulators. Aerogels are high-porosity, ultralight, materials that are 99+% air. Their properties include uncommon traits that allow aerogels to fulfill unique applications. For example, incorporating three-dimensional (3-D) aerogels into fibers produces clothing with properties that include protection against both extreme hot and cold. Currently, such aerogel fibers are produced using both dissolution and coagulation processes. However, dissolution and coagulation are time-consuming and chemically-intensive. Moreover, current aerogel fabrication processes struggle to produce continuous fibers consistently while also maintaining aerogel-like density and porosity. Thus, there is a need for an improved process that can create continuous, aerogel-like, fibers. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method for producing continuous fibers with highly porous aerogel cores. This technology combines cellulose - which is among the least thermally conductive materials - with highly porous aerogel structures in order to maximize the thermal insulation potential of the fibers. Moreover, the sheath component functions as a template and as a surface layer to protect the integrity of the aerogel structure from external forces or the environment. Thus, this method yields continuous fibers while maintaining internal aerogel structures. These fibers can potentially be used for various insulation devices, wearables, and other platform technologies with multiple, commercial scale, applications. Applications: Widespread thermal protection and insulation material applications. Features/Benefits: Provides thermal insulation in ambient temperatures ranging from -20 to 150\u00b0C, Produces fibers strong enough for weaving, knitting, and other textile applications, Can create fibers of variable diameters, Is scalable, Applicable to various, energy-saving, solutions.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed the first, digital, droplet infusion system capable of high-precision delivery of very low-volume therapeutics or nutraceuticals. Infusions to deliver medications intravenously are a common clinical practice. They are especially effective in treating patients who are not responsive to other drug delivery routes. Infusion applications include chemotherapy, outpatient surgery, pain management, and the delivery of medications and supplements such as antibiotics, analgesia, anesthesia, and alimentation. Microinfusion pumps provide relatively accurate delivery of some fluids at rates lower than 10mL/h \u2013 a volume commonly associated with pediatric patients, neonates, or for administrating short-acting or highly concentrated drugs. However, even automated infusion systems \u2013 which improve delivery control, precision, and safety compared to manual systems - have several inherent limitations. These limitations include volume inaccuracies at very low volumes, as well as other functional properties with various disadvantages. An emerging technology attracting increased interest is digital droplet infusion (DDI) systems. These systems have demonstrated their potential as a lower-cost, higher precision, alternative to existing infusion dispensing solutions. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a microfluidics-based infusion system that delivers very low volumes with extremely high precision. It employs digital droplet flowmetry, utilizing interfacial instability to convert continuous flow into uniform, discrete, droplets. The device\u2019s governing parameters also help increase the consistency of droplet volume. This technology can achieve micro-infusion rates ranging from 0.1mL/h to 10mL/h - with a precision resolution of 57nL for a single droplet. Its low-cost, modular design and simple architecture allow for fast assembly using only off-the-shelf and 3D- printed components - making it suitable for both disposable applications and remote settings. Thus DDI technology has the potential to become the next-generation clinical standard. Applications: Low volume, high-precision delivery of therapeutics and nutraceuticals, Safe for small children and neonatals \u2013 for whom precise delivery of very small infusion volumes is essential, Allows controlled dosing of short-acting or highly concentrated drugs. Features/Benefits: Simple device architecture and modular design promotes lower production costs, Small dimensions and footprint allows for portability and use in non-traditional settings, High accuracy at infusion rates ranging from 0.1mL/h to 10mL/h.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method of eliminating electrical current mismatches in the charge pumps of phase-locked loops (PLL) systems - thereby increasing their power efficiency and phase detection capabilities. Telecommunication systems and other signal processing applications often require frequency generation or matching. Traditional phase-frequency detector (PFD)-based phase-locked looping (PLL) is the standard technology currently for generating and synthesizing accurate frequencies. Sub Sampling Phase Locked Loop (SSPLL) technologies use a charge pump to help control the regulation of the electrical current sent into the filtering loop of the SSPLL. However, these charge pumps are highly susceptible to small voltage fluctuations that can reduce their locking range and lead to large output signal distortions. A method of regulating charge pump current would allow for the creation of a much more efficient SSPLL design \u2013 resulting in a better locking range, improved gain, and reduced power consumption. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a method of compensating for mismatched current in charge pumps. This new, SSPLL technology includes a sub-sampling phase detector (SSPD), a charge pump, a loop filter, a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), and a frequency-locked loop - which ensures a desired output frequency. It also implements a charge pump current mismatch compensation structure containing a \u201cdummy\u201d charge pump and feedback loops. The feedback loops sense the output voltage of the charge pump and provide compensating current to both the actual charge pump and the \u201cdummy\u201d pump \u2013 thus eliminating the electrical current mismatch. As a result, the voltage control locking range improves from 50% of the supply voltage to 75% - enabling the SSPLL to match frequencies more quickly. The signal gain improves as well, as degeneration associated with the phase detector is eliminated. Power consumption is also reduced, as the simplified voltage control design allows the supply voltage to be as low as 0.5V. This improvement is particularly important when operating at high frequencies. This technology is a significant improvement over existing SSPLL systems, and can be implemented in a wide variety of electronic circuits.",

However, current data storage and other memory technologies consume significant amounts of power. In addition, internal heat dissipation and other constraints may limit further advances in memory storage \u2013 while demands for increased data storage and retrieval capabilities continue to explode globally. Approaches for developing \u201cnext-generation\u201d data storage and memory options have included analyzing biological systems \u2013 both at the cellular level and by studying complex biological systems. The goal is to develop memory technologies that are low-cost, reliable, high-density, stable and consume less energy.

Thus, in situations when feeding an infant formula is the preferred caregiver option, it is important to consider adding key oligosaccharides found in human milk to formula milk. However, current methods to produce the desired oligosaccharides \u2013 such as extracting them from human milk or producing them with purified enzymes \u2013 are either expensive or have proven difficult to scale. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method for producing one key oligosaccharide - lactodifucotetraose (LDFT) - using a non-pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli cannot produce LDFT naturally. However, researchers have engineered E. coli to express several key enzymes that then allow the E. coli strain to efficiently convert lactose and fucose to LDFT. This process can produce LDFT economically at an industrial scale. This same approach can also be used to produce other human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Applications: Production of the human milk oligosaccharide LDFT for use as an infant formula additive or a functional food additive.

Fumigants have many industrial and agricultural uses \u2013 as vaporous pesticides to control microorganisms and insects in soils and other environment. Applications of the fumigants include fumigation of soil before plantation of fruits and vegetables and termite controls in building and grain. Human exposure to specific fumigants during production, storage, and application has long been a concern in many industries, as increased risks associated with exposure to fumigants may include higher rates of certain cancers, lung conditions, or even autoimmune diseases. Various mitigation techniques have been attempted. But all have had somewhat limited effects - because of either their inconvenience or cost limitations. Thus, better technologies are needed to minimize human exposure to these fumigants. And the increased need for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) across multiple settings has also highlighted the importance of more effective methods to limit human exposure to both pathogens of all types and potentially harmful chemicals. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed highly adsorbent cotton fabrics with demonstrated efficacy at neutralizing fumigant vapors and revealing a visible signal of accumulative exposure level. These materials use cotton fabrics containing highly porous organic \u201ccages\u201d on surfaces to capture fumigants and detoxify them quickly \u2013 often within one minute.

BRD is a major cause of death losses in both the US dairy and beef industry. Morbidity due to BRD results in loss of production, reduced carcass quality, and decreased health of the herd. Disease risk is typically assessed by herd veterinarians but currently, there are no assessment tools available to determine the risk of BRD in calf herds.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a phased-locked loop coupled array system capable of generating phase shifts in phased array antenna systems - while minimizing signal losses. Phased array antenna systems have a wide range of applications, including radar, sonar, long distance communications and imaging. An array contains evenly spaced antennas, often deployed in a two-dimensional grid pattern. Each antenna can be independently controlled - using phase shifters - to steer electromagnetic waves in a particular direction and thus create a concentrated beam. This approach allows the frequencies of the waves emitted by adjacent antennas to be adjusted as needed. These waves then superimpose to create the desired signal. However, current phase shifter technologies have limitations \u2013 including increased power consumption, risk of signal loss and limited operating ranges - especially when deployed in high frequency applications. Often, additional, complex, components are also required to design a phase shifter that can handle high frequencies. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a new architecture for generating phase shifts in phased array antenna systems. Phased-locked loop (PLL) coupled arrays generate phase shifts at high frequencies, while also being power efficient and scalable. This technology deploys a two-element, PLL-coupled, array that can be used in millimeter-wave and sub-terahertz phased array applications. The device regulates the voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), while simultaneously maintaining a steady reference frequency. This PLL-coupled array architecture eliminates the need for phase shifters at high frequencies. In addition, eliminating the requirement for long signal routings at high frequencies makes this technology scalable for mm-wave and sub-THz phased arrays that contain a large number of elements. This new, PLL-coupled, array architecture results in decreased signal losses, even after increasing power consumption.

    "ip_description": "Prostate cancer growth is often driven by androgens, which are male sex hormones such as testosterone. Currently, common treatment options for prostate cancer focus on lowering the levels of androgens in a man\u2019s body by surgical castration or by hormone therapy called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Despite advances in ADT that provide temporary relief from symptoms, patients often develop resistances to hormonal drugs and there is still no definitive cure for castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). High levels of cholesterol and its subsequent product dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) are observed in cell sublines that are resistant to ADT drugs. Emerging clinical evidence also shows DHEA concentration is highly elevated in advanced prostate cancer. DHEA synthesis is mediated by steroid sulfatase (STS), therefore inhibition of STS may be a viable strategy to treat resistant prostate cancer. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed several steroid sulfatase inhibitors (STSi) that can be used as a potential treatment to prostate cancer, specifically CRPC. STSi can hinder the growth of cells that are resistant to ADT drugs such as enzalutamide and abiraterone, and thus potentially prolong the effectiveness of ADT. STSi can also potentially decrease the resistance of existing cells and re-sensitize them to ADT treatments. Results from _in vivo_ testing has shown that STSi significantly inhibited VCaP tumor growth, which is a type of prostrate tumor particularly is resistant to ADT treatment. Moreover, in vitro testing has shown that STSi also inhibits breast cancer cell growth.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a catheter device that combines intravascular ultrasound with fluorescence lifetime imaging to better detect significant vascular conditions. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) are two distinct methods of medical imaging. IVUS has established clinical uses to detect both vascular plaque and arterial stenosis \u2013 but has several diagnostic limitations when used by itself. FLIm is effective at overcoming some IVUS limitations \u2013 such as the inability of IVUS to measure inflammation or plaque composition precisely. And, although FLIm has inferior penetration depth, it can be used to calculate PH levels, viscosity, and even blood chemical composition within a micro-environment. Thus, a diagnostic technology that combines both these techniques offers clinical advantages when assessing vascular health compared to either IVUS or FLIm used in isolation. However, previous attempts to combine these diagnostic techniques have not overcome limitations related to processing the IVUS and FLIm images simultaneously and in real-time. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed an integrated IVUS and FLIm catheter system that offers the combined, functional benefits of each technology. The catheter system includes an optical connector, fiber optics, and data acquisition electronics. Enhanced image processing functionality integrates the multi-spectral FLIm images with the structural images of blood vessels obtained from the IVUS echo signal. By combining these imaging techniques into a single imaging core, the result is a real-time, enhanced, comprehensive image of vascular conditions \u2013 including the ability to accurately characterize the morphology and composition of plaque within unhealthy blood vessels. Applications: Cardiovascular imaging, Plaque diagnostics - including morphology, composition, and pathological features. Features/Benefits: High resolution vascular imaging, Resistant to interference from signal sources and external tissue, Does not require exogenous dye or markers, Compact design allows the device to use standard IVUS entry techniques.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed compounds with the potential to be dual inhibitor therapies to target AKR1C3 and the androgen receptors that promote malignant cell growth. Some advanced cancers defy conventional chemotherapy and other common treatments. There is a need for new, clinically available therapies to treat these various advanced cancers \u2013 including prostate cancer. Advanced prostate cancer can be particularly difficult to treat if current androgen-related treatments (which can be initially effective) begin to develop resistance to traditional clinical approaches. Evidence from ongoing research globally indicates that androgen receptors (AR) and its variants ARv7 and AKR1C3 can promote cancer progression, either in prostate cancer cells themselves or by reducing the efficacy of prostate cancer therapeutics. Inhibiting AR/ARv7 and AKR1C3 could possibly improve treatment success rates by overcoming this resistance to current therapies. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have synthesized several dual inhibitors of AR and AKR1C3. These compounds were developed with the potential to inhibit AR/ARv7 and AKR1C3 expression and the subsequent activity of prostate cancer cells. The compounds show promise as mono or combination therapies that can help overcome resistance to the current therapeutics used to treat advanced prostate cancers. Applications: Treatment of prostate and advanced cancers in cases where other treatment protocols have proven ineffective. Features/Benefits: Inhibits malignant cell growth, Helps reduce resistance to current prostate cancer treatment protocols, Targets ARv7 and AKR1C3.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a separation system using microwave-infrared technology to effectively eliminate pathogens and reduce both the moisture content and potential greenhouse gas emissions of cow manure. Current handling of dairy cow manure includes flushing it from barns, then separating solid from liquid via various processes. One limitation to current handling processes is the high moisture fraction of manure. In addition, the anaerobic digestion associated with the decomposition of the manure can produce large volumes of the greenhouses gases methane and carbon dioxide. The use of manure as a soil amendment for crops can also be problematic due to the risk of manure-borne bacteria, some of which are pathogenic to humans. Thus, existing manure-handling methods can require extended elapsed time periods in order to reduce both moisture content and pathogen risks substantially. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a separation system using microwave-infrared technology to reduce pathogen risk substantially, while also reducing total greenhouse gas emissions associated with manure management. This treatment process occurs in 10-12 minutes and yields a stabilized, field-ready, manure product that poses no pathogenic bacteria risks to crops. The technology has the capability to reduce manure-borne bacteria to a non-detectable level (in 1-2 minutes of treatment) and lowers net greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, this process quickly reduces the weight of the manure by 80-85%, making the final product much easier and more cost-effective to handle and transport. This process of microwave-infrared solid separation allows for significantly more efficient handling of manure than current separation and treatment technologies. Preliminary economic analysis has shown the method to be very cost effective. Applications: Improved manure-handling process that drastically reduces total end-product weight, Reduces greenhouse gas emissions associated with manure management, Eliminates human pathogens from manure. Features/Benefits: Treatment process complete in 10-12 minutes, Allows dried manure to be used safely in multiple applications.",

Soy proteins, a major (4 times in mass) by-product of soybean oil extraction, are highly desirable protein source for important food, environmental and other industry uses. The versatile properties of soy proteins \u2013 which include foaming, gelation, and film-forming \u2013 can be leveraged in adsorbent fibers and other uses ranging from flavor/drug encapsulation, metal/dye removal in wastewater to cosmetics. However, soy proteins do not disperse readily in water or most common organic solvents, and thus are difficult to be processed to realize the beneficial properties of these proteins to be leveraged in a wider array of applications across industries. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed processes that can form soy proteins into colloids, gels, films, micofibrils or composite fibers. Stable aqueous soy protein colloids have been produced via either high-speed mechanical blending or sonication. The colloids can then be processed into emulsions or self-assembled or spun into ultra-fine fibers, fibrous structures or films. These colloids, sub-micron fibers, and microfibrils are uniquely amphiphilic and amphoteric and can serve multiple functions. For example, microfibrils exhibit liquid crystal behavior when shaken gently or stirred. These products can thus be used in multiple emulsifying, adhesion, adsorbing, encapsulating and controlled release applications \u2013 and as separating media for hydrophilic and hydrophobic or anionic and cationic compounds. The manufacturing techniques associated with these products are technically and economically viable at commercial scale - and thus are cost-effective options for producing sustainable and high performance materials critical to the food, chemical, environmental and multiple other industries. Uses as adsorbents, emulsifiers, detergents, dispersants and wetting and foaming agents across industry sectors \u2013 including in food formulation, cosmetics, biocomposites, porous membranes, and other consumer products and industrial materials.

Current almond drying methods include leaving harvested almonds on orchard floors for an extended time to dry naturally. However, this method can lead to microbial contamination and insect damage to the almonds. While commercial drying methods are also used, these practices dry an unsorted combination of in-hull almonds, in-shell almonds, and hulls simultaneously which causes inefficient drying. Moreover, current almond harvesting methods cause dust generation that pollutes the air and can impact the health of people over a wide area. Overall, there is a significant need for more effective almond drying and harvesting methods that limit dust generation. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed new methods for harvesting, sorting and drying freshly harvested almonds with high processing and energy efficiency while maintaining product quality. The method consists of separating off-ground almonds into three groups, including in-hull almonds, in-shell almonds, and hulls based on their dimension characteristics and aerodynamic properties. The method uses both terminal velocity and size to separate the almonds with low sorting errors, and can be used with off-ground harvesting methods that minimize dust generation. Additionally, these methods include drying techniques that utilize the optimum drying temperatures for each sorted almond group, and cut down on drying time and overall energy use.",

Thus, an amplifier that can increase power output without reducing desired increases in gain would provide significant benefits when compared to existing communication technologies. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed an amplifier that offers multiple techniques for boosting power and gain simultaneously. This combination of attributes also allows the amplifier to avoid common issues associated with impedance matching. These attributes are achieved in part by feeding a small fraction of the output power back to the input port using an embedded network. This technology also applies gain-boosting to reduce power stress and improves receiver signal-to noise ratios. The amplifier enables communications at very high frequencies, thus also offering opportunities for much higher data-rate transmissions than current networks can provide. This technology offers significant improvements for applications ranging from radar to imaging. Applications: All types of communications desiring/requiring higher signal-to-noise ratios, Security imaging and sensing and radar for autonomous vehicles or military applications, Systems that would benefit from operating at higher frequencies and data rate transmission speeds than current technologies can offer.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed absorptive bandpass filters that enable improved passband flatness and good impedance matching both in-band and out-of-band. In radio frequency and microwave systems, filters are used to improve signal clarity and remove or reject undesired 'noise.' Conventional filters function by producing mismatched impedance to out-of-band signals. However, this approach can also simultaneously deteriorate the performance of nearby non-linear devices - such as analog-to-digital converters, mixers, and high-gain amplifiers. Therefore, an alternate, technical solution is an isolator. But, too often, these types of devices are bulky, expensive, bandwidth-limited and difficult to integrate into holistic communications systems. Due to these limitations, a more effective, less expensive, absorptive (reflectionless), filter would have broad scientific and commercial applications. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed absorptive bandpass filters that have good impedance match not only in the passband but also in the stopband. These filters integrate absorptive stubs. The absorptive stubs absorb both the out-of-band reflection signals and the close-to-passband signals, resulting a reflectionless stopband and enhanced passband selectivity. As a result, this design for an absorptive filter is both more effective and efficient than other absorptive filters - and also offers much better performance than conventional filters. Applications: Improves the performance of radio frequency and microwave systems. Features/Benefits: Absorbs out-of-band reflection signals and close-to-band signals, resulting in a reflectionless stopband and enhanced passband selectivity.

Liquid handling is an essential step involved in many laboratory procedures. Samples must be transferred or dispensed quickly and accurately. To limit the human error often involved in manual operations, automated liquid handling workstations that use robotic interfaces to mimic pipetting functions have been developed. However, a major limitation of these current robotic technologies is the lack of precision during low-volume (sub-microliter) operations. Precise dispensing technologies now require expensive components to support high-precision nozzles for low-volume processing - and also need frequent washing to minimize cross-contamination. Thus, there is a need for a practical, automated, platform that can handle low-volume samples precisely.

Treatment typically includes a form of antimicrobial therapy. Similar UTIs also often present in otherwise healthy animals. Because of increased resistance to antibiotics, that treatment option has shown decreasing efficacy in treating recurrent UTIs. Alternative treatments or prevention techniques have been introduced.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method of detecting canine left atrial enlargement as an early sign of mitral valve disease by applying machine learning techniques to thoracic radiograph images. Heart disease is common in canines, with an estimated 10% of dogs in the U.S. developing heart disease during their lifetimes. Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD), in particular, affects a majority of dogs with heart disease. The mitral valve controls flow between the left atrium and left ventricle. It may degenerate over time or be damaged by endocarditis. Left atrial enlargement is an important part of the diagnostic evaluation for dogs suspected of having MMVD or other heart conditions. Thoracic radiography is a widely-available and relatively inexpensive method used currently to diagnose left atrial enlargement. However, diagnostic assessment of left atrial enlargement is somewhat subjective and prone to error. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method of detecting canine left atrial enlargement in right lateral radiographs by applying a machine learning framework. A convolutional neural network (CNN) - a commonly-used neural network algorithm often applied to analyzing visual imagery - uses multiple processing layers and a self-improving method called backpropagation to analyze the radiographs and detect abnormal left atrial size. Researchers have achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity comparable to veterinary radiologists during the testing of this algorithm. Because of the algorithmic nature of the neural network, this method will remove subjectivity from diagnoses and reduce the potential of human error.",

H&E methods can involve multiple tissue or biopsy preparation steps. Thus, these processes typically require elapsed times that are often incompatible with optimal intra-operative decision-making regarding the amount of tissue to be removed during surgery. Therefore, the field of pathology would be advanced \u2013 and positive surgical outcomes with reduced side effects would increase \u2013 if histopathological processes with reduced time scales were implemented. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a label-free, spectral, pathology method that can quickly identify regions of diseased tissue in vivo without the need for traditional hematoxylin and eosin staining. A multimodal microscope capable of acquiring varied and simultaneous microscopy/spectroscopy images of unstained tissue can survey the tissue structure and architecture, and - by comparing unique tissue signatures provided by the microscope, discriminate between diseased and healthy cells. This method overcomes historical limitations associated with current approaches to intra-operative histopathology. Applications include intraoperative pathology. Features/Benefits include offering a label-free method for near, real-time pathology results, reducing average times surgical patients remain under anesthesia, and increasing accuracy of tissue removal during surgery.",

Neurological disorders are devastating - often leading to irreversible neuron damage or loss.

Therefore, the need for more comprehensive and effective treatment options has stimulate multiple avenues of research. Exosomes secreted by human, placental-derived, mesenchymal cells (PMSCs) have demonstrated the potential for alleviating the severity of neuronal damage. Since their membrane composition is similar to that of a plasma membrane, exosomes are an excellent candidate for cell-free therapy. They are biocompatible and facilitate targeted delivery. However, exosome composition is variable, their isolation process is time-consuming and production yields are often low. Therefore, an alternative solution is needed to overcome these challenges. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method of synthesizing stem cell-derived, exosome-mimicking, nanovesicles (EMNs). These nanovesicles are similar to native exosomes in size, composition and biological functions. The EMNs can be used to package biological materials such as stem cell secretomes and therapeutic drugs, and can be synthesized using PMSC-derived lipid rafts.

Microencapsulation of biological molecules, cells, and chemicals is often used in food and pharmaceutical industries to increase the stability and shelf life of the encapsulated material and to control the pattern of release. Among encapsulation matrices, alginate is preferred due to its low-cost, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. Traditional alginate droplet-calcium bath encapsulation procedures are difficult to scale up and often produce undesirably large alginate beads. Researchers at the University of California, Davis developed a method for the production of Cross-linked Alginate Microcapsules (CLAMs) using a single step spray drying process which utilizes a calcium chelating agent and volatile base. The reduction in pH with volatilization of the base releases calcium ions from the calcium-chelate complex initiating alginate cross-linking. Particle size is in the range of 5-10 microns and the degree of cross-linking and hence release rate can be controlled by the level of calcium ion introduced. The process is flexible enough to accommodate other anionic polymers. In addition, the process can be modified to produce fibers or films. Applications include encapsulation of pharmaceuticals, food additives, nutraceuticals. Features/Benefits include: One step spray dry process, Alginate is natural polymer that is both biodegradable and biocompatible, Alginate matrix particle is uniformly cross-linked, Release rate from cross-linked alginate matrix particle can be controlled by adjusting cross-link density, Process can accommodate other anionic polymers.",

    "ip_description": "Heat stress in dairy cows causes multiple detrimental effects. It reduces milk production, decreases reproductive efficiency and can cause premature deaths of the cows. These concerns have led to increased interest in developing improved methods for identifying and addressing conditions likely to produce such heat stress. Current methods of controlling bovine heat stress include water spraying, as well as fans to increase air circulation. Existing controllers for fans and sprayers are based primarily on temperature indications, with some technologies also incorporating humidity measurements. However, the computational basis behind many of the algorithms built into these controllers remain unsophisticated (with many field programmed based on subjective human observations). Thus, there is a need for a sophisticated controller that can optimize the operation of cooling equipment based on real-time changes in ambient environmental factors.

    "ip_description": "Switched-capacitor power converters are non-linear circuits that can transition quickly to another circuit configuration under certain conditions. For overall system efficiency reasons, switched-capacity power converters have not been used historically as part of high-density power solutions. More recently, switched-capacitor-inductor (LC) converters have demonstrated improved performance at high conversion ratios and found some appropriate applications in this space. Split-phase Dickson converters have been introduced in the literature which are efficient under heavy loads but which suffer increased component voltage stress with increasing conversion ratio [1],[2]. Additionally, like most conventional DC-DC converters, split-phase converters suffer reduced efficiency at light load due to maximized switch utilization. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a converter which leverages three key innovations to yield an improved solution: First, this technology applies split-phase switching to a Cockcroft-Walton ladder variant; dramatically reducing voltage stress and allowing for a significantly smaller solution size. Second, a new highly efficient clocking scheme, termed \u201cN-Phase\u201d switching, was developed for the exact same hardware and which offers improved light-load efficiency relative to split-phase switching due to its reduced switch utilization [3]. Lastly, this technology allows for optimal merging of switching between N-phase and split-phase control yielding the advantages of both. The control system automatically selects the most appropriate switching scheme based on the operating point and associated power load. Since both N-phase and split-phase converters employ identical hardware, a control method that selects the optimal conversion technique for any operational environment provides the highest energy efficiency across a wide and variable load range. This technology thus has applications in mobile devices, aviation, biomedical markets and power distribution.",

Such response opens new opportunities to enhance the channel capacity in wireless systems, mitigate cross-talking and mutual-coupling effects in electromagnetically crowded environments such as roof of building, ships, and aircraft, and boost the performance of sensors and radar systems. The resulting devices are very efficient and require relatively minor modifications on standard phased-array systems. Applications: Enhance channel capacity in communication systems, Mitigation of cross-talking and mutual coupling effects in electromagnetically crowded environments (roofs of building, ships, aircrafts, integrated chips, etc.), Handle interferences and jamming signals in primary radar and wireless networks, Sensors. Features/Benefits: Independent control of transmission and reception radiation patterns at the same frequency, Reconfiguration capabilities, Applicable to different resonant antennas across the electromagnetic spectrum, Simple and efficient.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method for preparing a bacterial cell lysate that results in higher protein expression than existing cell-free systems. The new whole-cell lysate system comes with additional advantages, including the ability to synthesize protein from linear DNA, directly amenable to continuous or flow-based reaction, and compatibility with existing manufacturing workflow. The ability to generate a significant amount of proteins is critical for research and commercial activities such as drug screening and production, x-ray crystallography, and metabolic engineering. Cell-free systems have emerged as a potential method for protein production \u2013 in part because they do not require compatibility with the host. Unfortunately, the cost per milligram of protein obtained using existing cell-free systems is currently too high for widespread adoption. While preparation and substrate optimization have led to incremental increases in protein production methods over the years, no significant, qualitative advances in this field have been observed recently. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed methods and compositions of matter for preparing a new cell-free system using an engineered E. coli consortium. This new method induces cell-adaptation to the high demand for protein synthesis. The induced cells are then used to generate cell-lysates with high-performance for cell-free protein synthesis. This invention allows for 3-fold higher protein production than currently availably systems in both batch and continuous reaction modes. Furthermore, the new whole-cell lysate system directly allows for the production of proteins from linear DNA (i.e., PCR products and synthetic DNAs). Finally, the preparation of the new system is compatible with existing manufacturing workflow. It requires only the change of cell-strains used for manufacturing. Applications: Preparation of a bacterial lysate for in vitro or cell-free protein expression, Use in fields where current techniques of this type are not economically competitive at commercial scale. Features/Benefits: Results in 3-fold higher protein expression than commercially available, whole-cell lysates, Results in a more targeted translation machinery than current production methods, Allows cell-free synthesis of proteins from linear DNA, Requires only the change of bacterial strains in existing manufacturing workflow, Can be used in both batch and continuous reaction modes.",

    "ip_description": "PET is the most sensitive molecular imaging modality available currently for tracing biomedical processes in vivo. However, compared to other imaging modalities, the images provided by PET scanners often have high noise. As a result, PET scans must take longer to capture enough signal, resulting in poor temporal resolution and motion blurring artifacts. To address this, some PET imaging applications require the use of external devices, such as ECG, a breathing belt, or optical markers and fast dynamic applications have not been feasible. This limitation has historically resulted in PET scanners being less effective for monitoring blood flow, as well as cardiac, respiratory or other human systems. Thus, a method providing high temporal resolution PET scanning would offer enhanced imaging applications. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a methodology for high temporal resolution, dynamic PET by applying the kernel-regularized reconstruction paradigm to PET scanner data. This technique provides high-quality images for tracking fast tracer dynamics, such as blood flow and dynamic responses to neural modulation. Furthermore, the improved PET methodology enables real-time blood flow/circulatory system tracking, as well as motion-freeze monitoring for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory system function. This imaging can now occur without the need for additional external devices \u2013 and can be applied to any clinical PET system for marker-free, motion-free, real-time, fast tracer tracking. Applications: Study fast tracer dynamics, such as blood flow and dynamic response to neural modulation, Obtain motion-frozen images for cardiovascular and respiratory system function diagnosis. Features/Benefits: Can perform dynamic imaging with a temporal resolution of 100ms or less, Does not require external devices to perform real-time motion tracking.",

    "ip_description": "Phase-Locked Loops (PLL) couple the output signal with the input signal, which creates a relationship between their phases. Such loops promote synchronization and assist in extracting the information carried by frequency-modulated signals. While traditional PLLs use frequency dividers, this approach can generate significant signal noise. Thus, sub-sampling phase-locked loops (SSPLLs) are usually preferred \u2013 as they produce lower in-band phase noise. However, SSPLLs require a frequency locked loop (FLL) to avoid locking to the wrong harmonic input of the input frequency. The FLLs used require a large amount of energy when the input is a millimeter wave. This reality often leaves the user forced to choose between either having a noisy signal or consuming significant power. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have invented a SSPLL that uses a sub-sampling lock detector (SSLD) to monitor the harmonic selected by the SSPLL. The SSLD together with an on-chip generated, high frequency reference can automatically detect if the SSPLL has locked onto the wrong frequency. Then, the SSPLL can correct to the proper harmonic. Since the SSLD and high frequency reference generation circuits contain no millimeter wave frequency dividers, they consume much less power than a traditional FLL. Hence, this invention allows for a millimeter wave SSPLL that is simultaneously low-noise and low-power.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed methods that utilize molecules encapsulated in milk fat globules and plant oleosomes to deliver bioactive compounds for a variety of applications. Encapsulation using naturally-occurring and pre-formed carriers has been of increasing interest recently in multiple food, agricultural, cosmetic and medical applications. However, ensuring the stability of lipid-soluble bioactives in food systems frequently requires the addition of emulsifiers and high-energy methods to stabilize encapsulated compounds. There is also a need for the encapsulation system to both maintain good chemical stability and withstand the physical stress of the gastrointestinal tract. This is particularly true for vitamin supplement and food enrichment applications. With emerging needs for all natural formulations in food, cosmetics and agriculture sectors, the team at UC Davis has developed novel approaches to infuse diverse bioactive compounds in intact milk fat globules and plant oleosomes. The methods can encapsulate diverse bioactive compounds including vitamins, flavor molecules, lipid soluble natural compounds, and pharmaceutical actives in these natural lipid structures. These novel compositions improve the chemical stability of bioactives without the need for exogenous emulsifiers, metal ion chelators and antioxidants. Furthermore, the formulations improve bioaccessibility and have potential for taste masking. The formulations preserve the beneficial properties of milk fat globular membranes and provide high concentrations of bioactives in both liquid and solid forms. Applications include method of encapsulation, universal delivery system, food supplementation, drug delivery, or food flavors, cosmetic and skin care products, and nutritional products such as infant nutrition and nutraceuticals.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a biocompatible material to mimic the glycocalyx, the natural layer of molecules that coats the outside of endothelial cells. This technology can be used to treat inflammation in diseases characterized by dysfunction in leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions. Endothelial cells can lose glycocalyx when patients face chronic or acute systemic inflammation like that seen in COVID-19 or following ischemia reperfusion injury. When this loss of glycocalyx occurs, cell surface receptors are exposed to the extracellular environment. Circulating white blood cells (WBCs) then encounter the exposed receptors and bind to them - inducing an adverse inflammatory response. While circulating platelets support thrombus formation after encountering the receptors. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed an engineered biomaterial that prevents this inflammatory response by binding to the exposed receptors, thereby \u201chiding\u201d the endothelial cell from the WBCs and platelets. The biomaterial consists of two parts: a binding peptide resistant to enzymatic degradation; and a glycosaminoglycan. The binding peptide has a unique, peptide-resistant sequence that improves function at lower doses. Its overall composition is very similar to that of natural glycocalyx, making it a likely candidate for safe and effective use as a therapeutic in humans. Applications: A therapeutic for treating coagulopathy without systemic antiplatelet activity, Reducing endothelial cell inflammation, Minimizing disease-caused dysfunction in leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions.

    "ip_description": "Molecular enclosures appear often in both solid-state materials and biological systems, including nanoporous materials for energy storage and nanolipid particles for drug delivery. The constituent ions and molecules within these enclosures can largely determine the properties and performance of the entire system. Therefore, it is critical to determine their density, relative concentration, arrangement, physical and electronic structure, viscosity, diffusivity, and other properties. However, these properties can vary dramatically, yet often remain poorly understood. So improving understanding of how these systems are assembled can improve their design and efficacy in a variety of applications. Working together, researchers at the University of California, Davis and collaborators at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have developed a simulation method based on SGTI that improves understanding of the properties of molecular enclosures. SGTI is an improvement compared to standard thermodynamic integration (TI), because SGTI only requires knowledge of the initial state, while TI requires knowledge of states along the entire integration. The SGTI method developed employs a spliced soft-core interaction potential (SSCP) that is designed to more accurately represent the target hard-core interaction potential (HCP). The proposed method allows proper wall thickness to be maintained when filling an enclosure, an important consideration when attempting to maintain the target thickness of the enclosure's wall. The proposed SSCP can be used in any system employing a standard soft-core potential (SCP), and should be tunable to outperform previously-used SCPs in a wide variety of applications. Applications: Increase fidelity of simulations, Helps determine the properties of molecular enclosures, Can be incorporated into many standard simulation packages, Important for any system in which the size of the constituent contents (e.g., ions, molecules, polymers) is commensurate with wall thickness and final enclosed volume of the enclosure. Features/Benefits: More accurate than previously used techniques, Only requires knowledge of initial state of the system.",

Bioreactors are sterile environments often used for cell culture growth. Current methods to monitor cell culture health and growth inside the reactor include extracting a sample of the culture from the reactor every day. This monitoring process requires the cell culture and its media to come into direct contact with sampling devices, putting the entire culture at risk for inadvertent infection. Such pathogen contamination compromises the sterile environment of the bioreactor and therefore could ruin the entire culture. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a device that can monitor the volatile organic compounds emitted by cell cultures. For normal cell respiration, bioreactors pass air into the reactor and circulate it out through an exhaust. The device samples the exhaust gas VOCs, which are a normal by-product of cell metabolism. These VOC emissions can then be correlated against known standards to monitor and analyze both cell growth rates and overall bioreactor health. Monitoring these gases can thus help identify any adverse conditions within the bioreactor, perhaps allowing adjustments to be made that would improve the ongoing reactor environment in near real-time.",

Currently, graphene is employed in various applications, including electric circuits, solar cells and medical processes. Although graphene has many desirable properties in these applications, existing production processes for graphene typically yield low-quality or low volumes of graphene using excess surfactant or in organic liquids. A process for producing high-quality graphene in significant volumes is thus highly desirable. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a robust, simple and fast process for exfoliating graphite to single-layer to few layer graphene. This process utilizes novel amphiphilic cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) derived from readily available agricultural and food processing biomass that is non-toxic. Additionally, the fabrication process is aqueous and easily scalable for bulk graphene production. Graphene flakes produced from this method are stable in aqueous media without aggregation. By comparison, current techniques for fabricating graphene from bulk graphite at comparable concentrations require harsh organic compounds or significant quantity of surfactants and often result in graphene flakes that aggregate over time. The graphene flakes fabricated using CNFs can be readily formed into graphene nanopapers - which display unique moisture-responsive properties, as well mechanical strength and flexibility.

    "ip_description": "Breeding of diploid plants relies on thorough screening to identify novel and desirable characteristics. Large numbers of progeny from crosses must be grown, inbreed for 8-10 generations and evaluated over several years in order to select one or a few plants with a desired combination of traits. The process can be accelerated by producing haploid plants (or doubled haploid plants) to produce homozygous lines in one generation. Production of haploid plants that can be doubled to generate fertile doubled haploids in only one generation can dramatically improve the efficiency and effectiveness of plant breeding. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method to target and degrade cell-specific centromeric proteins using dormant, protease inducible N-degron to produce haploid plants. The method produces plant gametes with uncompetitive chromosomes that are lost during post-fertilization mitosis, halving the chromosome number. This method can use specific centromeric protein depletion in the gamete of one sex but not the other, as well as achieve genome elimination through self-fertilization within the same bisexual flower rather than relying on cross fertilization between genetically different plants. In addition, the depletion of centromeric proteins by protein degradation is more rapid and efficient than depletion by transcriptional or post-transcriptional repression. Researchers have demonstrated the N-degron induced depletion of centromeric proteins and ongoing tests about germline depletion causing haploid induction when in the gamete of one sex but not the other look promising. Haploid induction by self-fertilization using this method, combined with other manipulations, is advantageous to normal reproductive development. Haploids generated by this process may not be used for breeding as easily as those generated by cross-fertilization but within a cross-fertilization setting, ongoing experiments are testing the method\u2019s potential to be more efficient than haploid induction by centromeric protein variants.",

Up-conversion mixers modulate baseband signals to further broadcast through space or other media. The mixers should not constrain overall transmitter linearity, and their nonlinearities could be generated in many ways during the frequency translation. This makes analyzing the mixer difficult. Current methods of analyzing mixers use time-varying Volterra series or simulator-based analysis to address nonlinearity concerns but these methods overload the analysis, making it difficult, inefficient and costly to provide design insights with even greater analysis complexity when cascading nonlinear stages together. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a harmonic-based nonlinearity factorization scheme/method to fully characterize the time-varying behavior of the up-conversion mixer switching stages with low intermediate frequency (IF).

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed conductive nanocellulose aerogels as building blocks for mechanical strain sensors and coaxial aerogel fibers for cryo- and thermo-protective insulation. Nanocellulose aerogels are ultra-light porous materials used for a wide variety of applications including insulation, packaging, filtration, ion diffusion and drug delivery. Aerogels containing electrically conductive polymers have shown promise in applications such as strain sensing due to their compressive flexibilities and electrically conductive nature. The challenge, however, lies in the interface between the non-conductive and low dry compressive strength of the cellulose aerogel and the conductive polymer. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed conductive nanocellulose aerogels with higher dry tensile strength and modulus than current aerogels to be handled and used as stand-alone materials. The composite aerogel contains cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) protonated with conductive polymer, infused with an elastomer to be flexible, stretchable, conformable to shapes and motions as highly sensitive and linearly responsive strain sensors. In parallel, the researchers have also developed a coaxial structured microfiber containing nanocellulose aerogel core and cellulose ester sheath. The hierarchical pore structures in the core and the sheath combine the unique characteristics of low thermal conductivity, good mechanical strength, and low mass density to be highly insulating for applications in cryo- and thermo-protective wearables, deformables, portables as well as in space and large-scale structural applications. These novel fibers are renewable, biodegradable and producible in existing wet-spinning facilities to be scalable and cost effective.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method for measuring in-plane and out-of-plane surface magnetic properties of thin films. In magnetized samples, a reflected light beam (due to interaction with a sample) differs in phase from the original beam. This non-reciprocal optical effect provides information about the sample\u2019s surface magnetic properties. Surface properties are currently measured using two configurations: one where light travels zero-area but is normally incident to the sample and the other where light travels a finite-area loop but at an oblique incidence angle. Both methods are required to measure in- and out-of-plane magnetic properties but must be measured separately as combining both into a single measurement gives rise to delayed echoes and degradation of the overall signal. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a method which enables simultaneously oblique incidence and zero-loop area measurement configurations for sensitive detection of in- and out-of-plane magnetization. This method employs an optical configuration in which a single beam is split into two polarized beams that hit the magnetized sample at an oblique angle. The reflected beams then return to the beam source for recollection and phase analysis. Utilizing this oblique incidence allows for measurement of both in-plane and out-of-plane effects. Furthermore, reflection after light-sample interaction sends both polarized components back in such a manner that zero-area is enclosed in the loop traversed by the beam. This system allows for simultaneous oblique incidence and zero-loop area measurements while preventing delayed echoes and degradation of the signal. Applications: Probing surface magnetic properties, Characterization of thin films, Characterization of magnetized samples. Features/Benefits: Oblique incidence and zero-area loop, Simultaneous measurement of in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization.",

Data centers, or networked servers for the remote storage, processing, and distribution of large amounts of data, has merited the creation of photonics for high throughput communication. Currently, optical solutions are separate pluggable devices from the input/output (I/O) electronics, limiting energy efficiency and processing speed. Optical interposers that bring close integration of electronics and photonics are of strong interest but current photonic optical interposer design guides do not support close integration between photonics and electronics. Researchers at the University of California, Davis and NHanced Semiconductors, in consultation with Polytechnic and Analog, have developed a new type of optical interposer than can work within a small proximity between photonics and electronics. This new type of embedded optics technology decreases the distance between the electronics and photonics to less than 1 mm, avoiding impedance effects (capacitance and skin-effect induced high resistance). It uses less energy than existing optical solutions and can self-align, potentially offering cost-effective, low loss, and robust integration in photonic/electronic communication. The silicon photonic interposer would work without the use of high-speed-through-silicon-vias (TSVs), allowing for rapid and efficient data communication within integrated circuits. Applications include the creation of embedded photonics solutions that work at a closer distance between photonics and electronics that will lead to higher energy efficiency and better bandwidth density.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a quarter-rate serial link receiver with low aperture delay samplers for use in high-speed serial link interconnects in network systems. This receiver decreases the parasitic capacitances that result from threshold adjustments and can drastically decrease the amount of power required for high data rate applications. Serial links are used for connections between chips in networked systems and are important in multimedia sharing, cloud computing, virtual reality (VR) and other high use network systems. Traditional serial link receivers use equalizers, for example, half rate continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) with decision feedback equalizer (DFE), to reduce inter-symbol interference (ISI). Next-generation data rates, however, will require higher speeds and the currently employed half rate receivers will be inefficient and require more power. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have designed a quarter-rate serial link receiver with much lower aperture delays in the samplers for use in high date rate applications. This design ensures that almost no noise affects the data and that the power consumption of the serial link is unchanged due to the increased speeds by utilizing offset calibration and DFE threshold adjustment. The full quarter-rate architecture saves more than a half of power consumption compared to half-rate architecture and the combination of DFE threshold adjustment and the sampler offset calibration improves system performance without introducing excessive parasitic capacitance. This new scheme has been successfully simulated and confirmed to achieve better eye-open performance while consuming less power compared to traditional half rate equalization. Applications: Technologies that require a quasi-noiseless transmission of data within a networked system, Decreasing the latency and power usage in virtual reality headsets and other wireless devices, Improving energy efficiency and performance of cloud computing clusters. Features/Benefits: Decreases the power consumption of a serial link by taking away unnecessary parasitic capacitances, Improved noise reduction due to threshold adjustment and offset calibration.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have developed a dual soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)/ phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor for the treatment of inflammatory pain. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is an enzyme that metabolizes endogenous cytochrome P450s (CYP450) derived epoxy-fatty acids (EpFAs). Inhibition of sEH elevates EpFA levels, which has anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties. In general, however, the bioavailability of potent sEH inhibitors is poor while efforts to improve pharmacokinetics results in decreased potency. Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is an enzyme involved in the inflammatory response in immune cells and is a major target for inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and asthma. PDE4 activation is also correlated with symptoms of neuronal disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Currently, PDE4 Inhibitors are used to block the PDE4 enzyme in inflammatory pain therapies but have limited use due to side effects such as nausea and vasculitis. Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have developed a new drug that inhibits both soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4). This drug has been shown to reduce inflammatory pain in rats after oral application. Co-administration of PDE4 and sEH inhibitors resulted in an enhanced analgesic effect compared to the individual treatment and, by inhibiting both enzymes, the new sEH/PDE4 dual compound has the potential to provide rapid relief of inflammatory pain while improving bioavailability, mitigating vasculitis and limiting side effects such as nausea. Additionally, based on the current knowledge of the involved single targets and their inhibitors, diseases such as hypertension, COPD, neuropathic pain and depression could also potentially be addressed by this compound.",

High frequency filters and oscillator circuits utilize mechanical resonances to absorb or emit electromagnetic energy. Currently, these types of integrated circuits use piezoelectric materials that must be micromachined and tuned to achieve a desired frequency response. Generally, the resulting frequency produced is insufficient and additional circuitry is necessary to clean up the response, taking up additional space and increasing the cost of the overall circuit. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a hybrid high frequency vibrational metamaterial for use in optical and electrical devices. This superlattice metamaterial is composed of molecules and nanoparticles and can resonate in response to optical, plasmonic, electrical, thermal, or mechanical stimulation. By modifying the individual particles, a specific resonance can be achieved between 100 MHz to 2 THz. Moreover, the metamaterial exhibits a high quality factor (Q Factor), improving power efficiency and eliminating the need for costly additional circuitry.

Current methods to prevent the transmission of EIDs involve wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) including facemasks, bio-protective suits, and medical gloves. Although PPE significantly minimizes pathogen transmission, it cannot eliminate the full risk of infection. Additional solutions to minimize risk include using pathogens to capture and intercept viruses through protective materials.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a fabrication method for free-form reflective side viewing miniature optical elements to focus and reflect light with minimal chromatic aberrations. Current methods for fabricating side viewing optics include flat prism, gradient index element combined with a flat prism, and angle polished fused ball lens. A flat prism at the end of a fiber optic or fiber optic bundle can create a side firing probe but lacks a focusing element, affecting the collection efficiency and imaging resolution. This can be addressed with a gradient index element, but variations of index of refraction and absorption of dopant with wavelength leads to chromatic aberrations and limits the useable wavelengths of the probe. Additionally, the circular symmetry of the doping profile prevents correction of astigmatism introduced by a sheath. Alternatively, angle polished fused ball lenses can be used but the size of the ball is limited by constraints on the fusion process, thus limiting its application to small fibers and short working distances. Chromatic aberrations are also present with this design. Here, astigmatism introduced by a sheath can be addressed by creating elongated balls but the process used to obtain the right shape is lengthy and requires multiple trials to optimize the fusion recipe. Finally, the angle polished ball lens relies on total internal reflection so use of the element in liquids requires the probe tip to be fully enclosed. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method that enables the fabrication of miniature free-form optical elements capable of precisely focusing and reflecting light with minimal chromatic aberrations. This new method uses a flat piece of glass that is processed using photolithography, grayscale lithography, laser ablation, or other suitable technique to obtain an array of curved surfaces with free-form optical surface geometry to focus a beam. The array is then precisely diced to separate each optic. By leveraging microfabrication techniques to create precise free-form surfaces, the components can be optimized for a wide range of working distances/magnification and correct for any astigmatism introduced by a sheath. The created surfaces can be easily replicated with high precision and in high numbers, leading to a low cost per part. Additionally, a reflective coating can be easily applied to the free-form surface at the wafer level, such that fluid or adhesive in contact with the free-form surface does not adversely impact the optical performances of the element. Applications: Imaging devices used in catheterization, endoscopy and optical biopsy, Any devices or applications using micro optics. Features/Benefits: Allows for high precision and reproducibility manufacturing, Thousands of elements can be manufactured on a single wafer, lowering cost per part, Any optical surface geometry can be created for optimized imaging performance, Works with a wide range of working distances and wavelengths, Corrects optical aberrations introduced by device sheath, Can be used in fluid or potted within an assembly for a low additional cost per part with a reflective coating applied on the wafer.",

Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have discovered that the survival and engraftment of stem cells (e.g. in cardiac tissue) can be increased by first exposing the stem cells to an inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase in vitro. By using the novel soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEHI) inhibitors as adjuvant treatment in cell-based cardiac therapies, they successfully conditioned stem cells in vitro, which then resulted in significantly reduced oxidative stress causing lowered stem cell apoptosis. The survival of these stem cells is then improved when transplanted into the tissue of a subject.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed an all-in-one microscope combining ultraviolet excitation light with a waveguide directly integrated onto a light microscope stage, capable of providing surface morphology and fluorescence information with minimal sample preparation. Histology is an important tool in biology for visualization of plant and animal cells and tissues. Cells can be visualized with white light or polarized light to allow for visualization of fluorophores. Although both methods are effective, each mode provides detailed information that the other does not. Traditional microscopes illuminate a sample from either the top or bottom at normal incidence, which greatly limits the amount of information that can be retrieved. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have combined ultraviolet excitation light with a plastic LED waveguide, doubling the sample mount while successfully integrating it directly onto a light microscope stage. This waveguide can be fitted onto existing microscopes and is configured so that the excitation light is launched in from the side at an oblique angle to allow for the acquisition of images. By allowing the acquisition of images, this new method provides both surface morphology and general fluorescence information without the need for specialized lasers or separate imaging modes. Applications include high resolution, rapid histology, imaging of live plants, imaging of live animal cells, and surface morphology and fluorescence all-in-one. Features/Benefits include the ability to retrofit existing regular microscopes, easier switch between lenses, ability to use with high-NA short-working-distance lenses, no thin-sectioning required, minimal sample preparation, tissue can be stained in the cassette and can be replaced with a UV transparent window for imaging, uses non-total internal reflection conditions for deeper tissue imaging penetration, and can add additional spectral ranges for increased immunofluorescence detections.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a new flight mechanism that offers vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capability and cruising speeds comparable with fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Quadcopters lack adequate aerodynamic efficiency to sustain long range flights due to their hover flight oriented design. In addition, they sit close to the ground, decreasing any vertical advantage in grounded mode. A proposed solution to increase quadcopter operating range is to use a fixed wing aircraft. Fixed wing aircrafts, however, are not VTOL capable and are difficult to use where landing space is limited. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a new flight mechanism offering vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capability as well as cruising speeds comparable with fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicles. This new mechanism takes advantage of the offset angle between the engine and nacelle to switch into a horizontal flight (cruise) mode when the aircraft is pitched below the offset angle. This also allows for a faster cruising speed as the engines are tilted by the offset angle from vertical. In addition, the aircraft\u2019s propeller thrust governing system (PTGS) offers a simple solution to variable pitch propellers and allows the aircraft to maintain a constant rotational speed. Applications include long range missions and VTOL capability.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a robust header compression (ROHC) system to enable internet protocol data transmission with efficient radio resource usage over a wireless communication link. Internet protocol data constitute much of today\u2019s wireless traffic. Typically, cellular wireless networks transmit user information by dividing it into a sequence of packets with headers so that the receiver knows how to handle/interpret the data. Full headers in packet transmissions are very inefficient. Headers in successive packets are often highly correlated so the transmitter can compress while the receiver is able to decompress subsequent header based on the context from the previous header. However, as wireless channels are not error-free, the compressor in the transmitter cannot always send compressed headers, which would otherwise cause the decompressor in the receiver to lose context synchronization in case of consecutive packet losses, resulting in the inability to decompress successfully received headers. In unidirectional ROHC, the state of the decompressor cannot be directly observed by the compressor and thus the compressor must adjust the compression level autonomously and thus is less reliable. On the contrary, bidirectional ROHC uses a feedback channel so that the decompressor can communicate its context with the compressor. However, the frequent feedback from the decompressor to the compressor can be costly, and existing bidirectional ROHC schemes have a rigid feedback rate that cannot address the trade-off between compression efficiency and feedback. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a robust header compression (ROHC) system to enable data transmission with efficient radio resource usage over a cellular communication link. Substantially improving existing cellular header compression, this new invention can adaptively adjust compression level and request sporadic feedback based on trans-layer information collected from the RLC/MAC/PHY layer entities in the transmitter with an underlying partially observable Markov decision process model. The invention achieves flexible trade-off between transmission reliability/efficiency and feedback overhead. In addition, this new system requires few changes to other layers of the protocol stack, and therefore can be easily integrated into existing packet-switched wireless communication systems. Applications: High volume IP data transmission with efficient radio resource usage over a packet-switched wireless communication link composed of a transmitter, a receiver and the channel between them. Features/Benefits: Substantial improvement of data payload rate and efficiency of radio resource usage for the wireless packet transmissions, Flexible trade-off between transmission efficiency and feedback overhead, Easy and standalone upgrade of only header compression operations without altering the state-of-art cellular network protocols.",

Current applications of millimeter wave (mm-wave) and terahertz (THz) frequency regimes are spectroscopy, imaging, radars and short range communication. Although successful, these methods demand power generation, radiation with sufficient radiated power and frequency control, and are both bulky and expensive. Even harmonic oscillators, employed in phased arrays to overcome the frequency, have the limited generation capabilities of transistors and require an array of sources in order to extract sufficient output power. This new structure continuously distributes coherent arrays that avoid lossy and parasitic coupling networks and can easily be scaled by extending the size of the structure and replicating the unit cell. In addition, the structure enables the use of wide beam steering and high power radiation in phased arrays while completely avoiding the use of lossy phase shifters needed in conventional phased arrays. By completely removing the need for coupling circuitry and phase shifters between different elements in an array, this structure provides a cheaper and more efficient solution while being able to scale the array with no theoretical limits and having higher power arrays. Features/Benefits: Expandable arrays, Maximized tuning range, Maximized output power of each individual source, Continuous distribution, Easily scalable, Eliminates need for lossy phase shifters.",

Higher basal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells make them susceptible to ROS-induced apoptosis. A major producer of ROS in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (METC), respiratory complex III is a natural target for anticancer drugs. Current inhibitors of respiratory complex III promote ROS production by competitively out binding natural ligands, necessitating a relatively high dosage level causing attendant off-target effects. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have discovered a class of METC inhibitors that bind to a unique binding site within respiratory complex III. Inhibition of the METC increases ROS production in cancer cells triggering apoptosis. Due to natural ligands low affinity for this binding site, the effective dosage for these compounds is lower than current METC inhibitors, resulting in fewer side effects.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a non-thermal, digital microfluidic flowmeter with the ability to measure ultralow flow rates. Fluid flow is often measured using a pitot tube to calculate the flow based on pressure gradient. This method is prone to false readings due to the binding of fluids and overall poor accuracy when used in conjunction with low flow rates. Alternatives include thermal flow sensors which, despite being more accurate, are limited in application due to: their inability to be used with heat-sensitive fluids (including biological fluids), non-linear nature over usage temperature range and susceptibility to fluid contamination and complexed fluid flow. Non-thermal alternatives are often expensive, difficult to make, and are unable to reach the same sensitivities as their thermal counterparts. This creates a need for a non-thermal fluid sensor that can achieve good sensitivity and accurate readings under low flow rates and volume conditions. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a non-thermal, digital microfluidic flowmeter that can achieve highly sensitive and accurate measurements of ultralow flow rates. The device uses resistive, rather than thermal, principles to quantify fluid flow. Made using existing microfabrication technology, the flowmeters are inexpensive and easy to make and can be interfaced with adaptive fluidic configurations for use in a diverse range of applications. The robust microflowmeter is scalable and has already been tested in a wearable textile-based prototype, measuring, in real-time, a range of 3-70 \u03bcL/min flow of continuous saline solution.

    "ip_description": "Complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology has been extended to transceive circuits in the millimeter, high frequency range. High frequency signals offer larger bandwidth availability and require smaller dimensions for gain relative to antenna size compared to low frequency signals. In typical cases, a local oscillator is required to generate the signals modulated by CMOS. These local oscillators, however, have difficulty in generating stable, low phase noise and require a lot of power due to inefficiency at high operating frequencies. Thus, there is a need for a high efficiency broadband multiplier with high efficiency and output power to address the performance of local oscillators at high frequencies. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a push-push frequency doubler which adopts transformer based input balun with a newly invented central compensation capacitor for matching and balanced signal generation. The invention has a compact size and by choosing proper value of the compensation capacitor, the balun can achieve good balanced performance. The doubler is fabricated in a 65 nm chip area and consumes 9\u201314 mW power. It demonstrates a peak conversion gain of 2.5-dB and peak efficiency of 9.7% with a saturated output power of 2.5-dBm at 74 GHz. The doubler exhibits a 3-dB CG bandwidth of 28 GHz from 62 to 90 GHz and the fundamental rejection is larger than 20-dB.",

    "ip_description": "Cardiotoxicity is one of the most common and dangerous risks in the development of new drugs. Due to the association between prolonged QT intervals and drug-induced proarrhythmias, QT intervals have become widely accepted as markers for cardiac arrhythmia. QT intervals, however, have become problematic as they are neither sensitive nor selective in cardiotoxicity identification. This results in the unnecessary elimination of potentially useful drugs. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed PharmaCoLogic: a computer based multiscale model to predict the effects of developmental drugs and drug induced cardiotoxicity. The model uses dynamic interactions of drugs and ion channels (at the atomic level) to generate kinetic function parameters. These parameters are then integrated into predictive models at the channel, cell and tissue scales, to expose fundamental arrhythmia vulnerabilities and complex emergent behaviors. The model can be used to predict inherently coexistent risk factors during preclinical drug screening and drug rehabilitation. Applications: Preclinical drug screening, Drug rehabilitation, Drug induced cardiac arrhythmias, Drug interaction with inherently coexistent risk factors. Features/Benefits: Predictive computer based model, Able to predict drug effects over multiple time and spatial scales.",

Currently, there are no viable methods to study the behavior of highly dense nanoparticles dissolved in solution unless the solution is frozen and/or diluted, both of which disturb the natural environment of the nanoparticles. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have discovered a process called x-ray induced energy transfer (XIET) between nanoparticle donors and acceptors as well as developed a method, based on this process, to study the interactions of high density nanoparticles with high spatial resolution. The long penetration depth of X-rays allows energy transfer between the irradiated nanoparticle donor/acceptor pair to be studied in dense materials embedded in opaque media. The method can also be used to create targeted drug delivery systems by introducing a strong x-ray absorbing donor material that targets a specific host (such as cancer cells in a particular organ) and transfers the absorbed x-ray energy to a drug delivery release vehicle or acceptor. A lethal dose of drugs can be released with a low x-ray dose due to the increased radiation effect (type 2 physical enhancement, T2PE) on the vehicle generated by the donor material. XIET efficiency with T2PE has the potential to improve drug delivery and establish models for more efficient nanomaterial studies.",

Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a nondestructive method for identifying raw nuts with CD. The method employs Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) at selected wavelength ranges to generate a discriminant analysis model. The model can be applied to an automated sorting system to rapidly identify raw nuts with CD prior to roasting. These method can be used to establish thresholds for the specific kernel moisture content, temperature, and the various time and storage management scenarios to improve quality of the nuts and improve grower returns.

This becomes comprehensible when you consider the scarcity of portable water: 99.3% of total water is either too salty, or inaccessible (ice caps). In the search to expand access to permissible portable drinking water, desalination systems have become an area of growing interest. The current standard approach to desalination, called Reverse Osmosis (RO), has proved to be too costly in terms of energy consumption and operation cost to apply on a large scale. Researchers at the University of California Davis have developed a novel method of desalination which is integrated directly with a thin-film solar cell that provides enough energy to run the system without an external source. The integrated device utilizes the electric fields generated in a solar cell to tune the thickness of the electric double layer (EDL) that arises in nanopores during fluid flow. The EDL is then used to selectively reject ions passing through in order to achieve desalination. This system is an upgrade from current standard desalination system (RO) in that it reduces both energy and operation costs, making large scale deployment a possibility. Applications: Desalination of water systems. Features/Benefits: Primary source of energy is solar illumination, Channels formed in a PVD system, Minimized operating costs, Capacitive, Electrical based system, Reduced pore clogging, Larger channel size reduces flow resistance, Can be used with smaller pressures and pumps, Lower energy consumption compared to traditional RO systems.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a new technique for achieving ultra-high resolution heterodyne synthetic imaging across multiple platforms (e.g. multiple satellites) using optical frequency comb sources. Satellite-based imaging systems capture images of objects located significantly far away at high resolution. High resolution images are typically achieved by using a single large lens however a large lens is relatively expensive and heavy. Alternatively, researchers have been developing synthetic-aperture imaging systems that gather images from multiple platforms and combine them into a single high-resolution image equivalent to a single large aperture. So far, synthetic aperture systems have been limited in use due to the complex active optics required to coherently combine the optical signals from the collector optics. Heterodyne imaging system can address the complexity of the optics but requires an absolute calibration and stability of optical sources. Therefore, there is a need for a satellite-based heterodyne imaging system that does not suffer from absolute calibration and image instability. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have invented a new method of achieving heterodyne optical imaging across multiple platforms (e.g. multiple satellites). By placing a self-referenced precise and low noise optical frequency comb source at each platform, image sources will have an absolute and stable optical frequency reference. The self-referenced optical frequency comb can achieve stability of better than 1E-13 over 1 second which, with simple electronics or signal processing, can monitor drift in phase of frequency comb lines. The system can then combine the individual signals to create an image of ultra-high resolution. Applications: Multi-platform resolution imaging. Features/Benefits: Self-referenced optical frequency comb stabilization, High resolution images, Large number of wavelengths at channel spacing comparable to the electronic bandwidth of detectors, Detection across the entire optical spectrum can be achieved using many parallel detectors of typical detector bandwidths (~ GHz).",

Chemotherapeutic agents are becoming increasingly important as possible treatments for cancer but are susceptible to cancer resistance and compensatory cancer pathways.Therefore, there is a need for new compounds that can specifically target tumors based on their biology while being able to work concurrently with existing cancer therapies. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a new library of small molecule compound LLS2 that can kill a variety of cancer cells.

Nanoparticles offer several distinct advantages in these applications such as improved solubility, prolonged in vivo circulation time and preferential accumulation at a tumor site. One obstacle to the effective clinical application of nano-therapeutics is a lack of high affinity and high specificity targeting ligands that can deliver nanomedicines to a tumor or target site with high efficiency in vivo.

Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) regulate inflammation, pain and other biological processes relevant to human health. Their biological activities are mediated by their substrates epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) and arachidonoyl ethanolamide (AEA), respectively, and are essential components of eicosanoid and endocannabinoid signaling, respectively. These signaling pathways are known to modulate a number of disease states, including chronic pain, hypertension and cancer, and thus, these two enzymes are promising clinical targets. Despite substantial promising pre-clinical data for both sEH and FAAH inhibitors, none of the clinical trials to date have demonstrated efficacy for either target. One approach to overcoming this obstacle is to target two or more parallel pathways involved in the same disease.

Aerogels are ultra-light porous materials that are uniquely desirable for a wide variety of applications including insulation, packaging, filtration, ion diffusion and drug delivery. However, commonly used processes such as supercritical drying of silica aerogels, or freezing and freeze-drying of natural and synthetic polymer-based aerogels consume immense energy. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a facile and more energy efficient process to produce ultra-light nanocellulose aerogels with improved mechanical strength and hydrophobicity. This process enables drying under ambient conditions, and therefore does not require any high vacuum, freeze drying or heating steps. This process is not only more energy efficient and economic, but also feasible for scaling up. Chemical crosslinking results in aerogels that have an even higher specific surface area, dry compressive strength, and tunable hydrophobicity. Unlike hydrophilic silicon aerogels or hydropholic carbon nanotube or graphene based aerogels, these nanocellulose based aerogels are amphiphilic super-absorbents and tunable to become hydrophobic super-absorbents. These nanocellulose based aerogels are derived from sustainably sourced feedstock, i.e., waste streams of agriculture and food and beverage processing: the process turns under-utilized byproducts into high value added products and helps to reduce environmental impact of our food production system.

    "ip_description": "Bone homeostasis is maintained by a balance between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts. The anti-inflammatory system triad composed of RANK, RANK-L, and OPG orchestrates bone homeostasis by selectively activating osteoclasts and osteoblasts in a regulated fashion. In chronic osteolytic inflammatory diseases, such as periodontitis, the failure of endogenous resolution pathways seem to lead to bone loss and tissue destruction. Precise regulation of the RANK, RANK-L, and OPG triad promises a solution to this disease and many others. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a method to regulate the RANK, RANK-L, and OPG signaling pathway. This method regulates the signaling system to limit inflammation, cancer, arthritic disease, and bone loss while promoting bone growth, remodeling, and regeneration. This method is based on the elevation and regulation of epoxy fatty acid (EpFA) levels, which is accomplished by the inhibition of the enzyme, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). This method has proven effective to reduce bone loss in mice infected with periodontitis. Bioactive compounds are available that can be used topically for periodontal disease and have good pharmacokinetics and high oral availability for oral administration.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed an innovative synthesis approach to achieve high anisotropy L1 FeNi by combining physical vapor deposition and a high speed rapid thermal annealing (RTA). Magnetic anisotropy is a material property that anchors magnetic moments in place, enabling their practical use. High magnetic anisotropy materials are essential to the advancement of high energy density permanent magnets and ultrahigh density heat-assisted magnetic recording media. Current leading alloy candidates for recording media applications and permanent magnets include FePt, CoPt, FePd, NdFeB, and SmCo, which contain either precious noble metals or rare-earth elements. These materials are expensive and prone to extreme price fluctuations. An attractive alternative material is L10 FeNi, which is a metastable high anisotropy phase in a face-centered tetragonal crystal structure. It is conventionally formed by neutron bombardment, but the process is slow and impractical. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed an innovative synthesis approach to achieve high anisotropy FeNi by combining physical vapor deposition via atomic layer sputtering and high speed RTA. This FeNi synthesis contains only common earth-abundant elements, thus substantially reducing real costs and the economic uncertainties therein. This synthesis approach leads to stable L10 FeNi films with an anisotropy of >106 erg/cm3, substantially higher than the cubic A1 phase, and a high Curie temperature. Applications include high energy density permanent magnets, magnetic recording, hybrid/electric vehicles, motors, generators, MRI systems, magnetically levitated trains, wind turbines, power storage, consumer electronics (Cell phones, DVD/CD players, speakers), magnetic refrigeration, and materials separation. Features/Benefits include high magnetic anisotropy, high Curie temperature, earth-abundant common elements, cost effectiveness, less prone to price fluctuations, and convenient manufacturing.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a ROHC compressor that adaptively adjusts the compression level based on an underlying Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model. The popularity of smartphones and high speed networks has placed a great deal of pressure on existing wireless networks. This growing demand has made it essential to improve bandwidth efficiency. One way of doing this is through the ROHC approach which compresses data where capacity is strained. Although ROHC compressors exist, they either have no means of receiving an error recovery request, or they require their own feedback channel. The model makes use of the estimation of the channel status, and looks at results from previous transmissions in order to determine if they have been acquired from lower layers in the protocol stack. This novel method is advantageous in that it is both more efficient than a traditional U-mode ROHC compressor, and unlike O and R mode compressors, does not require its own ROHC feedback channel. Applications include compressing data and bandwidth efficiency. Features/Benefits include higher efficiency than U model ROHC compressor and no need for a dedicated ROHC feedback channel (which is required in both R and O mode compressors).",

Manufacturing bioproducts by means of chemical synthesis or extraction from natural producers, is limited due to the compounds\u2019 chemical complexity and low abundance in nature. The use of plant-derived enzymes in microbial or plant-based combinatorial production systems can enable the scalable and versatile production of various bioproducts. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed diterpene synthases (diTPS) of plant origin that show novel enzyme functions, and methods for producing natural and novel high-value diterpene natural products. A previously unidentified 5,7-fused bicyclic diterpene, termed pseudolaratriene, has expanded the known structural landscape of plant diterpenoids. There is evidence that pseudolaratriene serves as a key intermediate for pseudolaric acid B (PAB). PAB is a rare diterpenoid naturally occurring in the roots of the Chinese Medicinal plant golden larch and holds promise to yielding numerous therapeutic bioproducts with anti-cancer and anti-microbial efficacy. The broad spectrum of diterpenoid bioproducts accessible through combinatorial engineering of diTPS stretches from high-end perfume ingredients to potential pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer, diabetes and inflammation. Current therapeutics involving diterpenoids include the anti-cancer drug taxol and the weight-loss drug forskolin.",

The application of turbojet engines for military use has further supported the development to vector aircraft engine thrust, providing advantages to aircraft that would be otherwise unavailable. Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed a novel mechanism for vectoring the thrust of supersonic, air-breathing engines. The mechanism uses two asymmetrically staggered ramps; one placed at the throat of the engine nozzle, the other positioned at the exit lip of the nozzle. Thrust vector control (TVC) provides several advantages, such as increased lift and maneuverability. Applications include supersonic, air-breathing engines. Features/Benefits include lower external profile, increased maneuverability, and increased lift.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Davis have developed an energy-efficient voice monitoring technique for smart devices, such as smartphones and wearables, based on accelerometer data. Voice control has emerged as a popular method for interacting with smart-devices. Prominent voice control applications like Siri and Cortana are currently utilized by a large number of smartphones and tablets. User spoken voice control initiation commands, or trigger words (e.g. \u201cOkay Google\u201d or \u201cHi Galaxy\u201d), allow these applications to differentiate between user voice commands and normal conversations through the use of a microphone.

This technique utilizes low-power, low-cost accelerometer sensors, commonly available in today\u2019s smart devices, for continuous monitoring of a user\u2019s spoken voice control initiation commands, or trigger words. Our research demonstrates that accelerometer sensors can accurately detect and distinguish a user\u2019s voice commands through signal mining and machine learning classification.
