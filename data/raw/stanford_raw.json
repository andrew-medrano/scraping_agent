    "ip_description": "Stanford inventors have developed a method to efficiently differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into nearly pure populations of human blood progenitors or blood vessel cells in a Petri dish. This method solely uses extracellular signals to guide differentiation. Current differentiation protocols usually generate impure populations of human blood or blood-vessel cells from hPSCs. These impure populations only contain a subset of the desired cell-type, which limits the practical applications of these cell populations. Moreover, these protocols are typically lengthy that they require weeks to complete. This novel differentiation system enables efficient and rapid generation of nearly pure cell populations from hPSCs. It can generate 60-90% pure populations of desired blood or blood vessel cells in several days of hPSC differentiation. This allows wide applications of this differentiation system in treating blood related diseases and in tissue engineering. Applications include blood or immune system diseases, recovery from chemotherapy or radiation, and blood vessel generation. Advantages include generation of pure cell populations and efficient and rapid differentiation.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers in Prof. Corinne Beinat's lab have developed a small molecule radiotheranostic for targeted radionuclide therapy of cancers overexpressing system xc-, such as high-grade glioma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeted radionuclide therapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment, yet numerous cancers still lack safe, effective targeted treatments. The system xc- amino acid antiporter is overexpressed in various cancers, including glioma and NSCLC, and has been identified as a significant target. However, most radiotracers targeting system xc- encounter issues with high uptake in inflammation and undesirable tissue retention, hindering their efficacy and none thus far have been radiolabeled with therapeutic radioisotopes such as bromine-77. The inventors have developed a second-generation radiotracer targeting system xc- that can be radiolabeled with either fluorine-18 ([18F]hGTS13) for diagnostic imaging or bromine-77 ([77Br]hGTS13) for radionuclide therapy. In pre-clinical studies [18F]hGTS13 showed an improved tumor uptake in NSCLC rat models, and lower pancreas and kidney retention compared to [18F]FSPG, the most widely studied radiotracer targeting system xc-. Dynamic PET/CT imaging results further demonstrate that [18F]hGTS13 has a high and sustained glioma uptake in rats, making it particularly promising for glioblastoma imaging and treatment. In NSCLC in vitro studies, the brominated hGTS13 maintains transporter selectivity for system xc-. Hence, this second-generation hGTS13 radiotracer is a promising small molecule [18F]/[77Br] theranostic pair for high-grade glioma and NSCLC with favorable tumor-targeting properties, biodistribution, and tumor-selective cytotoxicity, and the potential to be applied to multiple other types of cancer. Applications: Cancer theranostics for tumors overexpressing system xc- (e.g., High-grade glioma, Non-small cell lung cancer), Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT), Cancer diagnostic. Advantages: First-in-class small molecule theranostic radiopharmaceutical for the targeted treatment of cancer, Favorable pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, Improved tumor-targeting properties and lower toxicity.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers in Prof. Engleman and Reticker-Flynn's labs have created a novel cell therapy that targets the T-antigen, a prominent tumor-specific antigen, by leveraging the high avidity interactions between lectins and glycans. The therapy is designed to enhance treatment for patients with a wide range of metastatic carcinomas unresponsive to current immunotherapies or targeted treatments. The field of cancer therapy has seen advancements, particularly in immunotherapy, yet a significant number of patients remain unresponsive to available treatments. Identifying and targeting specific tumor antigens remains a challenge due to the possibility of cancer cells evading immune detection through immunoediting. Furthermore, tumor-localized immune cells are often insufficient, and a systemic immune response is necessary for effective anti-tumor immunotherapy. Current therapies have not adequately addressed these issues, presenting an unmet need for treatments targeting key tumor features, such as the T-antigen. The inventors have developed an innovative cell-based therapy that targets the T-antigen, a key tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA), enhancing the potential treatment of a wide range of metastatic carcinomas. The technology addresses the core challenge in current cancer therapies, where patients either do not respond robustly or do not have a durable response to immunotherapy. This solution incorporates a novel lectin-based targeting domain, leveraging high avidity interactions between lectins and glycans, yielding a robust anti-tumor response. This innovative therapy reduces the possibility of cancer cells escaping treatment and disrupts metastatic tolerance by targeting lymph node metastases. Applications: Cancer immunotherapy, Treatment for metastatic solid malignancies. Advantages: Novel targeting: First cell therapy to target T-antigen in a peptide-agnostic manner, Enhanced efficacy: Leverages high avidity interactions resulting in robust anti-tumor response compared to traditional therapies, Durable response: Targets functional mediators of disease progression rendering evolutionary tumor escape less likely, Reducing the metastatic capacity of the tumor, Metastasis disruption: Potential to target metastases and enhance the overall immune response to immunotherapy, Specificity: Targets aberrant glycosylation seen in tumors, reducing harm to healthy tissues.",

SLAC researchers have a new manufacturing approach that achieves greater precision at significantly lower costs. Fabricating long undulator magnet cores has traditionally been challenging due to the difficulty in meeting precise mechanical and alignment tolerances, especially for lengths exceeding 1 meter. The new designs propose machining shorter, half-period segments that are stacked, aligned, and clamped to create longer cores. In response to growing demand driven by VUV lithography for advanced chip manufacturing, several companies and research laboratories worldwide are increasing the production of superconducting magnets, including undulators. This low-cost manufacturing approach with enhanced precision holds tremendous potential for both research and commercial applications. Figure Description: Design of an undulator magnet core. Superconducting wires are wrapped around two iron cores.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed ModulADAR - a novel RNA sensing platform that enables precise, cell-type or state-specific activation of mRNA expression using ADAR editing, offering unparalleled flexibility and specificity for targeted RNA therapeutics. Targeting specific cell types or states within complex mixtures of cells is a significant challenge in research and medicine. Current methods for targeting cells often lack the precision required to manipulate subsets of cells, such as cancerous or immune cells. This lack of specificity hinders the development of advanced therapies that could precisely eliminate pathogenic cells or modify specific cell populations for therapeutic purposes, such as in cancer treatment or immune cell therapies. Additionally, current RNA-based technologies often lack the flexibility to respond to multiple RNA inputs, limiting their utility in a broad range of applications. To address this challenge, Stanford researchers have developed ModulADAR, a novel solution that enables precise control of gene expression triggered by specific RNA sequences, allowing for the targeted manipulation of cells based on their type or state. This technology uses a modular RNA sensing system that incorporates ADAR editing, enabling the activation of mRNA translation only in the presence of predefined RNA triggers. This selective expression mechanism allows for the targeted activation in specific cell types or states, such as tumor cells or immune cells in vivo. Moreover, this modular system removes previous sequence constraints and provides greater flexibility, sensitivity, and specificity. This innovation opens new possibilities for developing precise RNA therapeutics and advancing research in molecular biology, cancer treatment, and immunology. Applications: Targeted RNA therapeutics, RNA level measurement in living cells. Advantages: Measures RNA expression in living cells with high precision, Removes the need for rigid sequence constraints, Modular and scalable platform, Broad applicability across diverse cell types and states, Improved sensor features result in increased ADAR editing efficiency.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Hydrogen that is free of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is a key vector to fuel a net-zero emissions economy, but today's H2 is sourced from fossil fuels mostly by the highly emissions-intensive processes of steam methane reforming (SMR) or coal gasification. Water electrolysis, the only viable technology that can produce CO2-free H2 today, produces H2 at costs 3\u20134 times higher (~$4/kg) than SMR and will have difficulty achieving the target $1/kg H2 production cost target of the US Dept. of Energy H2 Earthshot. Methane pyrolysis is a technology that could reach the $1/kg-H2 production target given that the energy intensity of H2 production of methane pyrolysis is much lower than water electrolysis and given that the produced carbon byproduct can be sold to offset the H2 production cost. However, methane pyrolysis technologies have historically been stymied by catalyst deactivation via coking. With this technology, we developed a semi-continuous heterogeneous catalytic CH4 pyrolysis process to produce CO2-free H2 and high-value carbon consisting of the following cyclic steps: 1. CNT growth by concentrated CH4 pyrolysis in a fluidized-bed reactor 2. In situ CNT dislodging (i.e., inside the reactor) and CNT recovery and collection by vigorous fluidization with humidified argon. The term 'semi-continuous' is defined as a process that can run continuously without requiring cooldown of the reactor or removal of the catalyst from the reactor for catalyst regeneration. In a commercial process, this semi-continuous process would be operated in a continuous manner by flow switching between multiple reactors operating in parallel (pyrolysis, purge, regeneration, reduction, etc.). Applications: Hydrogen: ammonia/fertilizers, methanol, refining, steelmaking, fuel-cell vehicles; Carbon nanotubes: composites materials like carbon fiber, concrete, cement; structural materials, electronics, automotive, aerospace, sporting equipment, tires, rubber. Advantages: H2 production at high H2 yields and high CH4 conversion with negligible process CO2 production; Highly crystalline CNT co-production at high yields; In-situ CNT dislodging for repeated catalyst use; Simple, scalable heterogeneous catalyst made from abundant materials; Potential for $1/kg H2 production cost with further research and development.",

This advancement has significant potential in enhancing solar energy harvesting, night vision, cameras, and bioimaging technology. Triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) is particularly promising for these applications due to its low up-conversion thresholds and broadband, tunable absorption. However, current NIR-to-visible TTA-UC systems are significantly less efficient than their visible-to-visible counterparts. For example, the current best NIR-to-visible TTA-UC solid-state devices, made of PbS quantum dots and rubrene, are limited by (1) low absorption of NIR photons, (2) low energy transfer rates, and (3) low conversion efficiency, which restricts their broader application. The Stanford team proposed a novel device architecture enabling strongly absorbing PbS films with improved efficiencies. Key innovations include (1) a 5-tetracene carboxylic acid interlayer to improve film homogeneity and upconversion efficiencies, and (2) a gold-based nanostructure to enhance absorption and emissive properties, yielding a fivefold improvement over control devices. Applications include photovoltaics, cameras/photodetectors, night vision, anti-counterfeiting, and bio-imaging. Advantages include access to sub-silicon bandgap photons (NIR photons beyond 1100nm), higher upconversion efficiencies, enhanced absorption and emissivity, and compatibility with solid-state device fabrication processes.",

Inventors in Stanford's Engleman lab discovered that these types of tumors grow faster in mice rendered obese through a high fat diet. Because macrophages play an important role in diseases associated with obesity and are present in high frequency in tumors, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) may contribute to this accelerated tumor growth. TAMs in tumors implanted into obese mice promote tumor growth, since their depletion from these mice results in slower tumor growth. TAMs in the tumors of obese mice express high levels of molecules that blunt immune activation of macrophages (in contrast to macrophages in obese mice that are outside of tumors), and obese mice in which the genes encoding these molecules are absent do not display accelerated tumor growth. Agents that neutralize or inhibit the functions of these molecules are expected to have therapeutic activity against tumors in the setting of obesity, including monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, and genetic approaches including RNAi that can knock down the expression of these molecules. Conversely, since these molecules inhibit macrophage-mediated immune inflammation, agents that enhance the signaling of these molecules may prove useful in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",

Populations of CAR-Treg cells are bimodal with respect to expression of the surface marker CD39, where the cytotoxic potential of these cell population depends on the expression of CD39. Selection for a CD39+ CAR-Treg population provides for a population with significantly reduced cytotoxic risk toward the cell population targeted by the CAR. Conversely, selecting the CD39- CAR-Treg subgroup can enhance cytotoxicity toward CAR-targeted cells. The CD39+ cell subgroup has potential to improved immunoregulatory function, which are useful in the treatment of autoimmune disease, to provide tolerance in transplantation, to promote wound healing or tissue regeneration etc. The CD39- cell populations on the other hand can be used for depletion of targeted populations, e.g. in cancer, depletion of undesirable antigen-presenting cells such as those present in transplantation rejection, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.",

This breakthrough technology could transform RNA-based therapeutics by allowing sustained protein expression from stable circular RNA, with applications ranging from cancer treatment to enzyme replacement therapy and RNA-based vaccines.\n\nIRES (Internal Ribosome Entry Site) sequences are crucial for initiating protein translation in circular RNA, but current solutions rely heavily on viral sequences which pose significant limitations for therapeutic applications. While eukaryotic IRES-like sequences offer a safer alternative, their efficiency has traditionally been much lower than their viral counterparts.

The development of effective non-viral IRES sequences for circular RNA could provide a new path forward for long-term protein delivery in diseases requiring sustained therapeutic protein expression.\n\nIRES-like sequences from mouse Hox genes enabled highly efficient cap-independent translation in circular RNA constructs. These sequences demonstrated superior translation efficiency compared to other eukaryotic IRES sequences, while maintaining the safety advantages of non-viral elements. Importantly, the system allows for fine-tuned protein expression through targeted 2-4 nucleotide mutations in the IRES-like sequences, enabling precise control over therapeutic protein levels.
