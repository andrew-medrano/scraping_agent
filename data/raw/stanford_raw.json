    "ip_description": "Stanford inventors have developed a method to efficiently differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into nearly pure populations of human blood progenitors or blood vessel cells in a Petri dish. This method solely uses extracellular signals to guide differentiation. Current differentiation protocols usually generate impure populations of human blood or blood-vessel cells from hPSCs. These impure populations only contain a subset of the desired cell-type, which limits the practical applications of these cell populations. Moreover, these protocols are typically lengthy that they require weeks to complete. This novel differentiation system enables efficient and rapid generation of nearly pure cell populations from hPSCs. It can generate 60-90% pure populations of desired blood or blood vessel cells in several days of hPSC differentiation. This allows wide applications of this differentiation system in treating blood related diseases and in tissue engineering. Applications include blood or immune system diseases, recovery from chemotherapy or radiation, and blood vessel generation. Advantages include generation of pure cell populations and efficient and rapid differentiation.",

The method overcomes key limitations of current organoid models by providing efficient nutrient exchange, uniform 3D structure formation, and improved reproducibility and scalability for translational applications. This technology utilizes a hanging droplet plate system with a hybrid biomaterial composite that mimics the biophysical properties of the brain tissue microenvironment. Additionally, the researchers have also characterized USP16, a novel Alzheimer's disease target found to underpin neural progenitor cell defects, contribute to inflammation and plaque pathology, and regulate stem cell aging and memory. This combined approach of advanced organoid technology and novel target characterization represents a significant advancement in modeling neurodegenerative diseases, offering a more physiologically relevant platform for drug discovery and personalized medicine approach.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers in Prof. Corinne Beinat's lab have developed a small molecule radiotheranostic for targeted radionuclide therapy of cancers overexpressing system xc-, such as high-grade glioma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeted radionuclide therapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment, yet numerous cancers still lack safe, effective targeted treatments. The system xc- amino acid antiporter is overexpressed in various cancers, including glioma and NSCLC, and has been identified as a significant target. However, most radiotracers targeting system xc- encounter issues with high uptake in inflammation and undesirable tissue retention, hindering their efficacy and none thus far have been radiolabeled with therapeutic radioisotopes such as bromine-77. The inventors have developed a second-generation radiotracer targeting system xc- that can be radiolabeled with either fluorine-18 ([18F]hGTS13) for diagnostic imaging or bromine-77 ([77Br]hGTS13) for radionuclide therapy. In pre-clinical studies [18F]hGTS13 showed an improved tumor uptake in NSCLC rat models, and lower pancreas and kidney retention compared to [18F]FSPG, the most widely studied radiotracer targeting system xc-. Dynamic PET/CT imaging results further demonstrate that [18F]hGTS13 has a high and sustained glioma uptake in rats, making it particularly promising for glioblastoma imaging and treatment. In NSCLC in vitro studies, the brominated hGTS13 maintains transporter selectivity for system xc-. Hence, this second-generation hGTS13 radiotracer is a promising small molecule [18F]/[77Br] theranostic pair for high-grade glioma and NSCLC with favorable tumor-targeting properties, biodistribution, and tumor-selective cytotoxicity, and the potential to be applied to multiple other types of cancer.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers in Prof. Engleman and Reticker-Flynn's labs have created a novel cell therapy that targets the T-antigen, a prominent tumor-specific antigen, by leveraging the high avidity interactions between lectins and glycans. The therapy is designed to enhance treatment for patients with a wide range of metastatic carcinomas unresponsive to current immunotherapies or targeted treatments. The field of cancer therapy has seen advancements, particularly in immunotherapy, yet a significant number of patients remain unresponsive to available treatments. Identifying and targeting specific tumor antigens remains a challenge due to the possibility of cancer cells evading immune detection through immunoediting. Furthermore, tumor-localized immune cells are often insufficient, and a systemic immune response is necessary for effective anti-tumor immunotherapy. Current therapies have not adequately addressed these issues, presenting an unmet need for treatments targeting key tumor features, such as the T-antigen. The inventors have developed an innovative cell-based therapy that targets the T-antigen, a key tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA), enhancing the potential treatment of a wide range of metastatic carcinomas. The technology addresses the core challenge in current cancer therapies, where patients either do not respond robustly or do not have a durable response to immunotherapy. This solution incorporates a novel lectin-based targeting domain, leveraging high avidity interactions between lectins and glycans, yielding a robust anti-tumor response. This innovative therapy reduces the possibility of cancer cells escaping treatment and disrupts metastatic tolerance by targeting lymph node metastases. Applications: Cancer immunotherapy, Treatment for metastatic solid malignancies. Advantages: Novel targeting: First cell therapy to target T-antigen in a peptide-agnostic manner, Enhanced efficacy: Leverages high avidity interactions resulting in robust anti-tumor response compared to traditional therapies, Durable response: Targets functional mediators of disease progression rendering evolutionary tumor escape less likely, Reducing the metastatic capacity of the tumor, Metastasis disruption: Potential to target metastases and enhance the overall immune response to immunotherapy, Specificity: Targets aberrant glycosylation seen in tumors, reducing harm to healthy tissues.",

Targeting specific cell types or states within complex mixtures of cells is a significant challenge in research and medicine. Current methods for targeting cells often lack the precision required to manipulate subsets of cells, such as cancerous or immune cells. This lack of specificity hinders the development of advanced therapies that could precisely eliminate pathogenic cells or modify specific cell populations for therapeutic purposes, such as in cancer treatment or immune cell therapies. Additionally, current RNA-based technologies often lack the flexibility to respond to multiple RNA inputs, limiting their utility in a broad range of applications. To address this challenge, Stanford researchers have developed ModulADAR, a novel solution that enables precise control of gene expression triggered by specific RNA sequences, allowing for the targeted manipulation of cells based on their type or state. This technology uses a modular RNA sensing system that incorporates ADAR editing, enabling the activation of mRNA translation only in the presence of predefined RNA triggers. This selective expression mechanism allows for the targeted activation in specific cell types or states, such as tumor cells or immune cells in vivo. Moreover, this modular system removes previous sequence constraints and provides greater flexibility, sensitivity, and specificity. This innovation opens new possibilities for developing precise RNA therapeutics and advancing research in molecular biology, cancer treatment, and immunology.

    "ip_description": "Hydrogen that is free of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is a key vector to fuel a net-zero emissions economy, but today's H2 is sourced from fossil fuels mostly by the highly emissions-intensive processes of steam methane reforming (SMR) or coal gasification. Water electrolysis, the only viable technology that can produce CO2-free H2 today, produces H2 at costs 3\u20134 times higher (~$4/kg) than SMR and will have difficulty achieving the target $1/kg H2 production cost target of the US Dept. of Energy H2 Earthshot. Methane pyrolysis is a technology that could reach the $1/kg-H2 production target given that the energy intensity of H2 production of methane pyrolysis is much lower than water electrolysis and given that the produced carbon byproduct can be sold to offset the H2 production cost. However, methane pyrolysis technologies have historically been stymied by catalyst deactivation via coking. With this technology, we developed a semi-continuous heterogeneous catalytic CH4 pyrolysis process to produce CO2-free H2 and high-value carbon consisting of the following cyclic steps: 1. CNT growth by concentrated CH4 pyrolysis in a fluidized-bed reactor 2. In situ CNT dislodging (i.e., inside the reactor) and CNT recovery and collection by vigorous fluidization with humidified argon. The term 'semi-continuous' is defined as a process that can run continuously without requiring cooldown of the reactor or removal of the catalyst from the reactor for catalyst regeneration. In a commercial process, this semi-continuous process would be operated in a continuous manner by flow switching between multiple reactors operating in parallel (pyrolysis, purge, regeneration, reduction, etc.). Applications: Hydrogen: ammonia/fertilizers, methanol, refining, steelmaking, fuel-cell vehicles; Carbon nanotubes: composites materials like carbon fiber, concrete, cement; structural materials, electronics, automotive, aerospace, sporting equipment, tires, rubber. Advantages: H2 production at high H2 yields and high CH4 conversion with negligible process CO2 production; Highly crystalline CNT co-production at high yields; In-situ CNT dislodging for repeated catalyst use; Simple, scalable heterogeneous catalyst made from abundant materials; Potential for $1/kg H2 production cost with further research and development.",

This advancement has significant potential in enhancing solar energy harvesting, night vision, cameras, and bioimaging technology. Triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) is particularly promising for these applications due to its low up-conversion thresholds and broadband, tunable absorption. However, current NIR-to-visible TTA-UC systems are significantly less efficient than their visible-to-visible counterparts. For example, the current best NIR-to-visible TTA-UC solid-state devices, made of PbS quantum dots and rubrene, are limited by (1) low absorption of NIR photons, (2) low energy transfer rates, and (3) low conversion efficiency, which restricts their broader application. The Stanford team proposed a novel device architecture enabling strongly absorbing PbS films with improved efficiencies. Key innovations include (1) a 5-tetracene carboxylic acid interlayer to improve film homogeneity and upconversion efficiencies, and (2) a gold-based nanostructure to enhance absorption and emissive properties, yielding a fivefold improvement over control devices. Applications include photovoltaics, cameras/photodetectors, night vision, anti-counterfeiting, and bio-imaging. Advantages include access to sub-silicon bandgap photons (NIR photons beyond 1100nm), higher upconversion efficiencies, enhanced absorption and emissivity, and compatibility with solid-state device fabrication processes.",

Inventors in Stanford's Engleman lab discovered that these types of tumors grow faster in mice rendered obese through a high fat diet. Because macrophages play an important role in diseases associated with obesity and are present in high frequency in tumors, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) may contribute to this accelerated tumor growth. TAMs in tumors implanted into obese mice promote tumor growth, since their depletion from these mice results in slower tumor growth. TAMs in the tumors of obese mice express high levels of molecules that blunt immune activation of macrophages (in contrast to macrophages in obese mice that are outside of tumors), and obese mice in which the genes encoding these molecules are absent do not display accelerated tumor growth. Agents that neutralize or inhibit the functions of these molecules are expected to have therapeutic activity against tumors in the setting of obesity, including monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, and genetic approaches including RNAi that can knock down the expression of these molecules. Conversely, since these molecules inhibit macrophage-mediated immune inflammation, agents that enhance the signaling of these molecules may prove useful in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",

Populations of CAR-Treg cells are bimodal with respect to expression of the surface marker CD39, where the cytotoxic potential of these cell population depends on the expression of CD39. Selection for a CD39+ CAR-Treg population provides for a population with significantly reduced cytotoxic risk toward the cell population targeted by the CAR. Conversely, selecting the CD39- CAR-Treg subgroup can enhance cytotoxicity toward CAR-targeted cells. The CD39+ cell subgroup has potential to improved immunoregulatory function, which are useful in the treatment of autoimmune disease, to provide tolerance in transplantation, to promote wound healing or tissue regeneration etc. The CD39- cell populations on the other hand can be used for depletion of targeted populations, e.g. in cancer, depletion of undesirable antigen-presenting cells such as those present in transplantation rejection, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have found that sialylated Fc ligands can be used to modulate immune responses to respiratory viral infections. Severe respiratory viral infections can trigger an aberrant inflammatory response that damages lung tissue and compromises gas exchange in the alveolar space, potentially leading to lethal complications such as respiratory failure. Immunoglobulins, comprised of Fc and Fab regions, regulate this inflammatory response, affecting the severity of viral diseases and effectiveness of vaccines. The Fc region is relatively constant among different antibodies in the same class, while the Fab region, also known as the antigen-binding fragment, is highly variable. Current immunoglobulin treatments for respiratory viral infections involve antibodies with Fab regions specific to the target viral protein, which limits their usage against different types of viral infections. Researchers at Stanford have shown that intravenous administration of immunoglobulin G with sialylated Fc domain, or even sialylated Fc ligand alone, helps preserve lung function after respiratory viral infection (Figure 1). The addition of sialic acid induces conformational changes that promote interactions with anti-inflammatory SIGN receptors. This approach can be applied against any viral strain, eliminating the need for adjustments when novel viral strains and mutations emerge.",

Quality control of gene therapy products is key to effective and safe clinical deployment. One hurdle to appropriate quality control is that most clinical AAV vectors do not transduce efficiently in tissue culture systems, making it difficult to measure titer and potency, which are important for quality assurance and dosing. Currently, the quality control of gene therapy products based on AAV vectors consists of determining the physical characteristics of the particles and a crude measure of \"genome titer,\" which does not directly measure the ability of the viral particle to infect cells. This can lead to viral preparation varying widely in their quality and potency. To allow for direct in vitro measurement of AAV potency, Stanford inventors have created a cell line with greatly enhanced susceptibility to AAV transduction. By tuning AAV receptor (AAVR) expression and inhibiting one key gene, the inventors have engineered AAV-Titer, cell lines that are highly suitable for functional titration and potency assay development for clinical gene therapy. Applications: Quality control and R&D of clinical gene therapies. Advantages: More accurate and consistent titer measurement for AAVs used in clinical gene therapies.

    "ip_description": "The recognition of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes by T cells is the cornerstone of cellular immunity, enabling the elimination of infected or tumoral cells. pMHC can thus be leveraged as a detection tool for T cells. The molecule naturally exists in a monomeric form, which impedes easy detection of T cells due to their weak equilibrium dissociation with the lymphocyte. To overcome this limitation, inventors at Stanford have developed a flexible pMHC display system on a self-assembling protein scaffold. Termed a spheromer, the platform has high compatibility with currently available pMHC molecules and streptavidin reagents that are routinely used for T cell analysis. Due to its increased specificity and sensitivity, the pMHC-spheromer platform overcomes the current limitations of existing T cell detection platforms. The platform is a valuable tool that can be used for the detection, isolation, and activation of antigen-specific T cells, enabling the successful tracking and modulation of the adaptive immune response.\n\nApplications:\n- Detection and quantitation of disease-relevant T-cells\n- Disease tracking, such as immunity in vaccinated individuals\n- Induction of antigen-specific immunological tolerance to treat autoimmune conditions\n\nAdvantages:\n- Greater detection efficiency than any commonly used pMHC multimer reagents\n- Customizable system enabling addition of co-stimulator molecules\n- Modulation of anti-tumor/anti-viral immunity by inducing antigen-specific responses",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have discovered a first-in-class covalent inhibitor that binds to activated Fis1 and prevents mitochondrial fission and dysfunction. Mitochondria, essential for cellular function, undergo dynamic processes of fusion and fission and balancing the two is critical to retain optimal function. Fis1 protein responds to cellular stress by recruiting Drp1 to mitochondria and driving excessive fission. This process is known to cause mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction and contribute to pathogenesis of variety of health conditions (such as neurodegeneration, inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases). Previously, the molecular mechanism of activation of Fis1 during stress was unknown and thus hard to target. Now, researchers have identified the mechanism of Fis1 activation and discovered a first-in-class covalent inhibitor of activated Fis1. The small molecule covalently binds to activated Fis1, preventing pathological fission and protecting against oxidative stress-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction. These compounds have potential to be developed as therapeutics for a number of disease conditions with underlying mitochondrial pathologies that currently have no approved therapies. Applications: Treating diseases impacting mitochondrial fission, including neurodegeneration, inflammatory conditions, and cardiovascular diseases. Advantages: First-of-its-kind molecule to covalently bind to activated Fis1, prevents pathological mitochondrial fission without affecting physiological mitochondrial fission.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a 3D-printed biodegradable zinc implant with mechanical properties suitable for structural support after core decompression in osteonecrosis patients. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a debilitating disease characterized by collapse of the femoral head due to an interruption in blood supply to mesenchymal and hematopoietic cells. Early diagnosis allows preservation of most of the femoral head through a procedure called core decompression. In this procedure, a path is drilled into the bone to stimulate new bone formation and blood vessels ingrowth. An implant is then inserted into the drill hole to provide structural support and guide tissue ingrowth. To date, these implants have been porous scaffolds made of nondegradable metals. Biodegradable metals can allow for more complete bone growth as the implant gradually degrades. Stanford researchers have found that an implant made of zinc or zinc alloy in a customized 3D form can bear the load after core compression while promoting osteogenesis. They used laser powder bed fusion to 3D-print the metal into the desired geometry (Figure 1). Their prototypes featured cylindrical shapes with lattice structures, but the design can be adjusted to create any specific degradation profile for enhanced vascularization. Applications: Core decompression surgery for osteonecrosis, Femoral head, Humeral head. Advantages: Biodegradable, Better osseointegration due to enhanced osteogenesis and angiogenesis, Load bearing capacity of nonbiodegradable metal implants, Degradation properties can be tuned.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed an innovative AI-driven solution that leverages the BERT-based AI model to automatically classify patient-provider messages into 12 distinct categories, reducing clinician workload and enhancing workflow efficiency in healthcare settings. In healthcare communication, there has been a dramatic rise in secure patient-provider messaging, particularly Patient Medical Advice Requests (PMARs), which enables patients to seek medical advice, request medication refills, schedule appointments, and discuss their health concerns directly with their healthcare providers. Currently, there is no effective way of sorting these messages without involving manual examination. Moreover, this surge in PMARs has introduced several challenges like the lack of efficient processing methods and workforce capacity to handle PMARs, leading to clinician burnout and inefficiencies in patient care. To address these critical challenges, Stanford researchers from Quadrant Health and Stanford's Healthcare Applied Research Team have developed an innovative AI solution using the BERT algorithm to automate categorizing patient-provider messages. BERT is designed to understand the context and semantics of text, making it highly effective at categorizing unstructured and multidimensional messages like PMARs. The model was trained on PMARs from online patient portals to categorize patient-provider messages into 12 distinct classes including medication, scheduling, paperwork, orders, results, data entry, referral, and review level. By automating the classification of PMARs, we eliminate the need for manual review and sorting by clinicians, enhancing workflow efficiency and reducing burnout. In summary, our innovative AI solution addresses the critical problem of managing the surge in PMARs by automating the categorization process, thereby reducing clinician workload and improving overall efficiency in patient-provider communication. Applications: First-of-its-kind, comprehensive approach to patient message categorization, Healthcare providers, hospitals and Electronic Health Record (EHR) system developers. Advantages: Integrates with EHR systems, allowing for automated workflows, Reduction in clinician workload, Improved workflow efficiency and minimizing delays in patient communication, High accuracy and efficiency in patient message categorization, Scalable and adaptable.",

The tool, which uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data as input, is called CytoTRACE and is based on the premise that less differentiated cells express a larger number of genes. CytoTRACE has been validated across 42 scRNA-seq datasets and outcompeted ~19,000 other features in predicting the differentiation status of single cells. The platform can identify markers to isolate regenerative cells in normal human tissues and target tumor-initiating cells that drive recurrence in cancer. CytoTRACE can be applied independently of tissue, platform, and species, with no prior knowledge required. The inventors have validated their discovery pipeline in data from human breast cancer patients. CytoTRACE identified a new target, GULP1, and demonstrated that the knockdown of this gene abrogates the growth of human breast cancers xenografted in mice. Applications include target discovery in oncology and regenerative medicine, identification of tumor-initiating cells, identification of novel stem cell and tumor cell populations, biomarker identification in oncology and cellular regeneration, characterization of cellular hierarchies in complex cell populations, and assessment of chromatin accessibility on a single-cell level. Advantages include applicability across all cell types, tissues, and species, ability to be applied independently of sequencing protocol, no need for a 'reference' point or prior knowledge of differentiation status, and outperforming many leading computational models.",

Uniform heating of volumetric media to high temperatures is the foundation of many physical and chemical reaction systems that involve elevated processing temperatures or endothermic heat requirements. The predominant source of heating for most high temperature reactor systems is chemical fuel combustion, which produces significant carbon emissions. Inductive heating is an established method for clean, efficient heating. However, an underlying challenge to date is understanding how inductive heating can be adapted to heat volumetric media efficiently and uniformly, which requires unique specification of the susceptor and power electronics. Researchers at Stanford University have incorporated a metamaterial mesh susceptor and high-efficiency electronics to create a sustainable thermochemical reactor that can produce a customized volumetric heating profile. Their invention electrifies the heating process by using magnetic induction to produce high frequency currents. The mesh susceptor in the core of the reactor can be tailored to support electrically conductive properties that enable high efficiency and uniform inductive heating within the entire reactor volume. This invention can assist in decarbonizing many heavy industrial processes. Applications include carbon dioxide capture, oil and gas production, steam cracking, limestone decomposition, cement and ceramic manufacturing, materials processing through pyrolysis, and hydrogen sulfur capture and utilization. Advantages include decarbonization, uniform heating at high temperatures, efficiency, high reaction rates, smaller size, lower cost, and scalability.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed tissue-based profiling by deep sequencing for detection of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) by tracking patient-specific tumor mutations in post-chemotherapy tissue samples, enabling a highly sensitive, molecular-level assessment of residual cancer. Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the U.S, with over 260,000 cases diagnosed annually. Despite advancements in treatment, more than 40,000 Americans still die each year due to metastatic breast cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is essential for shrinking tumors before surgery in locally advanced cases, yet current methods to detect residual disease post-NAC lack sensitivity. Pathological assessments and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) tests often miss microscopic traces, leading to undetected residual disease and undertreatment of patients. A more accurate detection method is urgently needed to guide patient selection for adjuvant treatments, inform targeted therapies, and reduce recurrence risks. To address this need, Stanford researchers have developed tissue-based deep sequencing for Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) detection, which offers a highly sensitive approach to identify residual cancer cells in tumor tissue after NAC. Unlike traditional pathology, which relies on visual examination, spatial-MRD (sMRD) uses ultra-deep sequencing to detect molecular traces of cancer across different regions of the tumor tissue, even when no residual cells are detectable under the microscope. In pilot studies, s-MRD demonstrated superior accuracy and sensitivity compared to traditional pathology, detecting molecular residual disease in resection tissues where pathology was negative but the cancer later recurred. With its potential to outperform existing methods, s-MRD represents a promising advancement for improving breast cancer outcomes and making it a valuable tool for global oncology care. Applications: Cancer diagnostics, Prognostic tool for personalized treatment, Companion diagnostic in drug trials. Advantages: High sensitivity detection of minimal residual disease at a molecular level, Personalized profiling of residual cancer, Alternative to manual pathology, especially beneficial in resource-limited settings, Adaptable to multiple cancer types beyond breast cancer.",

Ureteral stents are a standard tool in urological procedures, primarily used to ensure urine drainage from the kidney to the bladder after interventions like ureteroscopy. While effective, the current stent designs frequently lead to stent-related complications in over 80% of patients, causing symptoms such as pain, bladder spasms, and urine reflux. These issues often result in unplanned clinical visits, contributing to patient discomfort and healthcare costs. The market has yet to see a ureteral stent that effectively addresses these root causes. To address this need, Stanford researchers have developed UreStent - an innovative ureteral stent designed to tackle stent-related complications (SRCs). UreStent is engineered to provide all the benefits of a standard ureteral stent, such as ensuring drainage and preventing ureteral obstruction, while minimizing SRCs by prioritizing patient comfort and clinical efficacy. Key design features include a flexible polymer conduit for adaptable placement, and a distal tip with collapsible tube and a flexible retention cone to prevent reflux, reducing kidney irritation and bladder spasms.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have designed a novel tricuspid annuloplasty ring that minimizes the risk of interrupting cardiac conduction during implantation. Tricuspid regurgitation is a prevalent heart condition in which the tricuspid valve fails to close completely during ventricular contraction. The disrupted unidirectional blood flow could lead to abnormal pressure or volume overload. Patients with moderate to severe cases may require annuloplasty, where a ring device is implanted over the annulus around the tricuspid valve to support valve leaflets. While securing the device, sutures often inadvertently cross the bundle of His in the septum, disrupting heart conduction. To avoid this complication, there is a critical need for alternate annuloplasty devices. Researchers in the Woo Lab at Stanford have created a modular annuloplasty device that avoids suture placement in conduction tissue. Its most basic form is a C-shaped band with a wide gap between the two ends to avoid traversing over the septal leaflet. The device can be further secured by adding a flexible polymer that joins the ends of the device. Alternatively, the ends can be conjoined with a bridge-like structure that bends away from the valve. The bridge is angled to conform to the septal wall and aorta, improving retention. Applications: Tricuspid valve annuloplasty. Advantages: No suture placement in conduction tissue, Reduced need for pacemakers, Improved retention strength, Reduced recurrent regurgitation.",

Mitral annuloplasty ring implantation is one of the most common mitral valve surgeries to reduce mitral regurgitation by establishing proper leaflet coaptation. Mitral ring sizing is a difficult process whereby a surgeon decides how much to reduce the size of the annulus while the heart is arrested. Methods currently do not exist to adjust the ring size once the heart has been restarted, and small sizing errors often result in persistent regurgitation, which requires the surgeon to re-arrest the heart and re-perform the annuloplasty procedure. To avoid exposing patients to this additional risk, Stanford researchers have developed an annuloplasty ring with a mechanism to adjust its size after the heart has been closed and re-animated. They used custom folding and semiflexible material technologies to enable asymmetric annulus constriction via sutures routed through the ring. The suture-based tightening mechanism exits the left atrium and allows for post-implantation adjustments based on real-time heart function. This invention enables surgeons to address minor sizing errors without extensive reoperation.",

State of the art manufacturing of integrated Ti:Sapphire technology relies on costly, size limited, highly doped Ti:Sapphire wafers which are limited in size, doping control, and uniformity.\n\nStanford researchers start using a standard, undoped, sapphire substrate, in which a near surface level Titanium source is created via implantation of or deposition. This layer can be patterned via masked implantation, or lithographically deposited. High temperature annealing improves the doping layer quality.

Finally, the undoped sapphire portions of the original material are removed, leaving a wafer-scale thin-film Ti:Sapphire platform.

Multiple integrated microfluidic channels introduce single droplets of consistent size onto the optoelectronic substrate. The optoelectronics precisely encapsulates and decapsulates individual solid supports (i.e., polystyrene microbeads) with corresponding picoliter volume reagent microdroplets. Complete encapsulation ensures uniform reagent exposure, which reduces errors and improves the final yield rate significantly.

The Hesselink Group successfully demonstrated the on-chip enzymatic oligonucleotide coupling reaction and are adapting the platform for a wider range of reactions. This light-orchestrated microdroplet reactor platform provides quicker, more affordable, more efficient, and sustainable oligonucleotide synthesis.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted between humans and animals. Viral mutation and zoonotic transfer are anticipated to lead to future pandemics and largescale outbreaks. Indeed, the COVID-19 respiratory disease likely originated in bats, and led to a pandemic with over 750 million cases and nearly seven million deaths worldwide. To date, there are a limited number of active pharmaceutical agents that are effective at treating COVID-19 or other coronavirus infections in patients. There is therefore an urgent need for therapeutics capable of treating infections arising from known coronaviruses, as well as from new coronaviruses that will arise in the future. For instance, the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies was a major advance in the treatment of COVID-19. However, known mAb therapies gradually become ineffective with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The inventors have developed improved fusion proteins containing an antibody domain, that binds a highly conserved epitope of betacoronavirus Spike proteins on the S2 subunit, and an ACE2 domain, which serves at the neutralizing domain. SARS-CoV-2 variants are less likely to escape the binding of fusion proteins than neutralizing mAbs targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins. Applications include use as a broad and high-potency therapeutic against coronavirus infections, fusion protein therapies which are likely to inhibit any betacoronavirus that uses the highly conserved ACE2 as a receptor, making them suitable for stockpiling in anticipation of the next betacoronavirus jumping from animals to humans, and use in high-risk patients with complex medication regimes. Advantages include greater breadth of protection than previously described fusion proteins, the use of fusion proteins with enzymatically inactive ACE2 (the virus' own host receptor), which prevents adverse side effects of administering fusion proteins with active ACE2 domain, more efficacious in vitro activity than known anti-coronavirus mAbs, broad neutralizing range that includes all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV-1, and expected to have few, if any, interactions with other medications a patient may be taking.",

The inventors have developed methods for the biomanufacturing of large-scale tissue constructs. This includes methods for preparing a tissue and allowing the printed cell structure to incubate in the biocompatible matrix. The printed cell structure is generally removed from the biocompatible matrix when it has sufficient strength to be self-supporting or has developed into a contiguous tissue. Applications include: The biocompatible matrix can comprise a foam, emulsion, colloid, granular medium, or gel. The biocompatible matrix can include one or more types of diverse growth media or can include polyacrylic acid. The cell bioink can comprise a slurry of compacted organoids such that they are deformed from their equilibrium shape. The cell bioink has a cell density similar to that of native tissues, and it is substantially free of exogenous material such as collagen or gelatin. Advantages include: An extended time can be allowed for at least a portion of the cells in the printed cell structure to develop into a contiguous tissue. Depending on the type of cells, this can range from 24 hours up to 15-to-50 days, unlike other state-of-the-art methods where cells must be removed from the printing matrix almost immediately. The biocompatible matrix can include a rheological modifier to tune the self-healing time of the matrix; a rapid, self-healing matrix can help alleviate deformation of the printed cell structure due to the stiffness of the matrix from the high yield stress during printing.

    "ip_number": "S22-032",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Current methods of genetically-engineered cells require precise integration of genetic material. Genotyping is usually used to detect genetic edits; however, it's difficult to track the exact changes made in each individual cell in a large cellular mixture, especially when the cells receive multiple edits. While whole genome genotyping is available to track each cell in a mixture, the technique is expensive and time-consuming. Thus, there is a need for additional methodologies that enables quicker and cost-efficient tracking of genetic edits within cells of interest. The Fraser lab at Stanford has invented a genetic engineering platform that enables multiple cellular gene editing while tracking the exact edits being made. The invention consists of two or more CRISPEY modules covalently produced by the vector, where the combination of edits that will be made across all modules are predetermined. Each module applies edits of interest tagged with unique sequences that can be easily genotyped by DNA sequencing or other methods. When needed, the intended combination of precise edits for each can also be inferred by Sanger sequencing, NGS, or other detection methods. Unlike existing methods, the invention can be applied to a mixture of cells as well as single cell or clonal cell lineages, and provides an efficient, high-throughput, and low-cost method for genetic and cellular engineering. Applications include tracking relative abundance of cells targeted by a mixture of edit in parallel, such as high-throughput precision editing genetic screens to improve industrial microbial growth, select strains for improving crop yield, track edited cell populations treated by genetic editing medicine, and track edited cell populations used in-cell therapy. Advantages include a high-throughput, cost-effective method compared to existing methods, does not require integrating of vector into the genome, detection of the first edit (label) that installs the unique sequencing indicates that the edit tool is functional, and higher likelihood of the rest of the cells containing the second edit that is intended, important for isolating edited cells of interest. Edits made to the same target cell iteratively can be tracked by reading past unique barcodes installed into the genetic material. The barcode label can also be associated with antibiotic markers or other markers that allow cell purification.",

    "ip_description": "Theranostics represents a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, offering a more personalized and molecular approach to cancer diagnosis and treatment with striking efficacy and low toxicity. The significance of theranostics therefore lies in its ability to personalize and optimize medical treatments by tailoring them to individual patients. B7H3 is a transmembrane protein, that has recently been identified as a pan-cancer antigen with dense expression across a multitude of cancer types and with restricted expression in normal tissue, rendering B7H3-targeted radiotheranostics a viable treatment option for millions of patients. Despite the promise of B7H3, no peptide ligands have been identified. Furthermore, because the protein lacks structural and functional characterization there is currently no a priori way to design ligands. Stanford researchers have discovered B7H3-targeting peptides from peptide phage display that can be used for cancer theranostic applications, such as for diagnostic imaging and peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy. This would allow for both the diagnosis and treatment of various advanced or refractory cancers lacking other viable therapies. The newly identified peptide is the first peptide identified specific to B7H3, and when chelated to 68Ga and 177Lu, the first radionuclide therapy for B7H3. Researchers predict that the B7H3 peptide-targeted radiotherapeutics would have preferential uptake in tumor tissue where the majority of DNA damage would occur, with timely elimination from clearance organs. Stage of Development: In vitro and in vivo: proof of concept in cell lines. Applications: Cancer diagnostic, Radionuclide cancer therapy, Cancer theranostics. Advantages: Cost effective synthesis, Can be used to diagnose and treat a range of resistant and refractory cancer types, Favorable pharmacokinetics, First peptides identified specific to B7H3, Can chelate 68Ga and 177Lu for radionuclide therapy.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers at the Kasevich Lab have developed a module that can attach to any standard optical system or sensor for wide-field, time-resolved imaging. This invention enables nanosecond image gating and modulation in low-light conditions, opening new applications for wide-field imaging such as fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). This technology enables the first wide-field lifetime camera that is compatible with single-molecule microscopy. Existing sensors for wide-field nanosecond imaging (e.g. time-of-flight cameras, SPAD arrays, and gated intensifiers) sacrifice performance and are not compatible with low-light applications in bioimaging and fluorescence microscopy. The researchers have demonstrated the use of electro-optic wide-field imaging gates for nanosecond temporal resolution with high photon collection efficiency. Their method enables wide-field FLIM in a single exposure image on any standard camera sensor. By acquiring all pixels in parallel they demonstrate 5 orders of magnitude improvement in imaging speeds compared to single photon counting. They have also demonstrated 39 MHz image modulation for fluorescence lifetime microscopy of single molecules at high frame rate. This allows FLIM applications in super-resolution microscopy and observations of single-molecule dynamics such as FRET. Prototypes have been tested on commercial microscopes. On-going work: Researchers are continuing to improve the technique to allow larger imaging field-of-view, higher frequency operation, and improved electro-optic configurations. A compact and user-friendly module for MHz resonant image modulation is under development. The inventors have expanded upon this technology in Stanford Docket 19-424: Wide-field Resonant Electro-optic Imaging Devices and Applications.

Low-cost nanosecond camera sensors with favorable performance and form-factor are more desirable, especially for applications in LIDAR and fluorescence lifetime imaging. The Kasevich lab has developed resonant electro-optic imaging techniques and optimized the design of electro-optic crystals to allow compact, low-cost, and wide angular field-of-view imaging.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have invented a twist-expand mechanical bioreactor that provides an appropriate _in vitro_ microenvironment for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived cardiomyocytes to achieve biomimetic anisotropic alignment and form contractile cardiac tissue. Many studies have successfully demonstrated directed differentiation of iPSCs into cardiomyocytes. However, further assembling and maturing the iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to mimic the mechanics of the native heart tissue remains a challenge. To overcome this challenge, studies have created microenvironments resembling that of primary cardiomyocytes during development: micropillar structures were placed to provide a 3D environment and exogenous cues were applied to facilitate anisotropic alignment of cells for coordinated contraction and electrical conduction. The engineered tissue's maturation was improved but still not comparable to the native heart. Researchers at Stanford have devised a platform that provides a more biomimetic microenvironment (Figure 1). Using advanced 3D bioprinting technology, cells were printed with soft silicone in preferred arrangements. The print was placed in an electrically conductive bioreactor that can be actuated to apply torsional force or pneumatic pressure to the silicone to introduce twisting and contractile cardiac mechanics that the micropillar approach neglected to include. This system has the potential to form functional macro-level heart tissues from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Applications include cardiac tissue engineering, drug testing, disease modeling, and developmental studies. Advantages include mimicking the complex contractile pattern of the native heart tissue better than other existing systems and potential for personalized treatment.",

    "ip_description": "The ascending somatosensory pathway transmits sensory information, including pain, touch and itch, from the peripheral nervous system to the brain. Dysfunctions in this pathway are linked to disorders like peripheral neuropathy and autism spectrum disorder. Despite a significant need for effective therapeutics modulating pain and other somatosensory modalities, clinical translation remains challenging, which is likely related to species-specific features and the lack of in vitro models to directly probe and manipulate this polysynaptic pathway. To remedy this issue, Stanford researchers have developed the first human ascending sensory pathway model using assembloids. The method involves differentiating human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells into regionalized neural organoids resembling the components of the human sensory ascending pathway (Figure 1). This model provides a unique opportunity to directly study and manipulate the human sensory ascending pathway, overcoming previous challenges. This platform also enables functional analysis, including synchronized neural activity across the entire sensory pathway, offering a powerful tool for drug discovery targeting sensory disorders.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have engineered hematopoietic stem cells to provide long-term secretion of chosen therapeutic antibodies, eliminating the need of repeated dosing for delivery. Thirty nine million people worldwide are living with HIV infection. Autologous transplantation of specific hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is the only known cure for HIV-1 infection. However, this treatment is extremely limited due to the rarity of specific matched donors, the morbidities associated with allogeneic transplantation, and the prevalence of HIV-1 strains resistant to select gene knockout treatments alone. To circumvent these limitations, Stanford researchers genetically engineered HSPCs that secrete antibodies against various targets, including but not limited to HIV, PCSK9, and TNF-alpha. The genetically engineered HSPCs can be delivered via a one-time therapy through autologous transplantation. This technology could be used to develop autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapies for the long-term delivery of therapeutic antibodies for various diseases.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have discovered that the untranslated region (UTR) of RNA can be engineered into autonomous switches capable of both sensing native biological conditions (e.g. T cell activation) and promptly responding by initiating the translation of a therapeutic sequence (e.g. a chimeric antigen receptor). Autonomous mRNA switches can provide dynamic regulation within cellular immunotherapies and offer broad utility in next-generation mRNA therapeutics, such as engineering chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells _in vivo_.\n\n_Ex vivo_ CAR T cell therapy has shown significant success in treating oncology patients and combating malignant tumors. However, this approach is limited by the expensive and time-consuming _ex vivo_ production process, which can take several weeks, and the challenge of administering only a single effective dose to patients, leading to potential tumor relapse. In contrast, _in vivo_ CAR T cell therapy offers a promising solution by directly engineering T cells within patients using mRNA therapeutics. This innovative approach enables rapid and customizable production, with the transient nature of mRNA therapies allowing for precise temporal control of therapeutic doses. Nevertheless, advancements are needed to develop technologies capable of sensing relevant biological conditions and tightly regulating the translation of therapeutic payloads. Novel strategies for controlling mRNA expression in T cells will enable the development of _in vivo_ T cell therapies that can alleviate T cell dysfunction while preserving the protective immune responses required for human health.\n\nNovel engineered UTR sequences resulted in RNA elements that can sense T cell signals and modulate therapeutic mRNA expression as ON/OFF switches. These mRNA switches have been shown to induce the translation of genetic payloads upon T-cell activation. The use of these mRNA switches to control the translation of a CAR in engineered T cells resulted in the expression of the CAR and the killing of antigen-positive tumor cells. Importantly, when co-cultured with antigen-negative cells, there was no difference in CAR expression or killing when compared to baseline. Consequently, autonomous mRNA switches have the potential to enhance cellular immunotherapies and enable the development of _in vivo_ CAR T cell therapies.\n\n**Stage of Development:**\nPreclinical \u2013 _in vitro_ data\nContinued research \u2013 _in vivo_ demonstration of efficacy and further description of switches that capture other immune cell states (e.g. T cell exhaustion, NK cell activation, etc.).

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have developed an ingestible smart pill to sample biomarkers from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract plays an important role in maintaining overall health, as it is responsible for digesting food, absorbing nutrients, and eliminating waste. Sampling from the GI tract, particularly its mucous layer, is essential in understanding gut health and disease. Bioanalytes from the mucus can provide insights into inflammation, metabolic function, and immune response. Currently, invasive procedures like endoscopy and colonoscopy are used to sample from the GI tract. There is a need for a non-invasive method. Smart pills have recently emerged as non-invasive sampling platforms. However, to date, they have relied on passive diffusion and thus are not suitable for viscous mucus. Stanford researchers have designed a smart pill that can be swallowed and docked at a desired location in the GI tract for active sampling of the mucus. After confirming the pill's location within the GI tract, its hydrodynamic screw is remotely actuated. The rotational motion facilitates the collection of mucus samples along its spiral path, directing them towards a dedicated collection chamber. This technology could enable easy, simple, affordable, and repeat sampling of GI tract regions of interest. Applications include precision medicine, early disease detection, health monitoring, and disease management. Advantages include the ability to collect high viscosity samples, multiple sampling locations, cost-effectiveness, non-invasiveness, and enabling frequent high-quality data collection.",
