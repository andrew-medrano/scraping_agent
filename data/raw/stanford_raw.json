    "ip_description": "Stanford inventors have developed a method to efficiently differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into nearly pure populations of human blood progenitors or blood vessel cells in a Petri dish. This method solely uses extracellular signals to guide differentiation. Current differentiation protocols usually generate impure populations of human blood or blood-vessel cells from hPSCs. These impure populations only contain a subset of the desired cell-type, which limits the practical applications of these cell populations. Moreover, these protocols are typically lengthy that they require weeks to complete. This novel differentiation system enables efficient and rapid generation of nearly pure cell populations from hPSCs. It can generate 60-90% pure populations of desired blood or blood vessel cells in several days of hPSC differentiation. This allows wide applications of this differentiation system in treating blood related diseases and in tissue engineering. Applications include blood or immune system diseases, recovery from chemotherapy or radiation, and blood vessel generation. Advantages include generation of pure cell populations and efficient and rapid differentiation.",

The method overcomes key limitations of current organoid models by providing efficient nutrient exchange, uniform 3D structure formation, and improved reproducibility and scalability for translational applications. This technology utilizes a hanging droplet plate system with a hybrid biomaterial composite that mimics the biophysical properties of the brain tissue microenvironment. Additionally, the researchers have also characterized USP16, a novel Alzheimer's disease target found to underpin neural progenitor cell defects, contribute to inflammation and plaque pathology, and regulate stem cell aging and memory. This combined approach of advanced organoid technology and novel target characterization represents a significant advancement in modeling neurodegenerative diseases, offering a more physiologically relevant platform for drug discovery and personalized medicine approach.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers in Prof. Corinne Beinat's lab have developed a small molecule radiotheranostic for targeted radionuclide therapy of cancers overexpressing system xc-, such as high-grade glioma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeted radionuclide therapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment, yet numerous cancers still lack safe, effective targeted treatments. The system xc- amino acid antiporter is overexpressed in various cancers, including glioma and NSCLC, and has been identified as a significant target. However, most radiotracers targeting system xc- encounter issues with high uptake in inflammation and undesirable tissue retention, hindering their efficacy and none thus far have been radiolabeled with therapeutic radioisotopes such as bromine-77. The inventors have developed a second-generation radiotracer targeting system xc- that can be radiolabeled with either fluorine-18 ([18F]hGTS13) for diagnostic imaging or bromine-77 ([77Br]hGTS13) for radionuclide therapy. In pre-clinical studies [18F]hGTS13 showed an improved tumor uptake in NSCLC rat models, and lower pancreas and kidney retention compared to [18F]FSPG, the most widely studied radiotracer targeting system xc-. Dynamic PET/CT imaging results further demonstrate that [18F]hGTS13 has a high and sustained glioma uptake in rats, making it particularly promising for glioblastoma imaging and treatment. In NSCLC in vitro studies, the brominated hGTS13 maintains transporter selectivity for system xc-. Hence, this second-generation hGTS13 radiotracer is a promising small molecule [18F]/[77Br] theranostic pair for high-grade glioma and NSCLC with favorable tumor-targeting properties, biodistribution, and tumor-selective cytotoxicity, and the potential to be applied to multiple other types of cancer.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers in Prof. Engleman and Reticker-Flynn's labs have created a novel cell therapy that targets the T-antigen, a prominent tumor-specific antigen, by leveraging the high avidity interactions between lectins and glycans. The therapy is designed to enhance treatment for patients with a wide range of metastatic carcinomas unresponsive to current immunotherapies or targeted treatments. The field of cancer therapy has seen advancements, particularly in immunotherapy, yet a significant number of patients remain unresponsive to available treatments. Identifying and targeting specific tumor antigens remains a challenge due to the possibility of cancer cells evading immune detection through immunoediting. Furthermore, tumor-localized immune cells are often insufficient, and a systemic immune response is necessary for effective anti-tumor immunotherapy. Current therapies have not adequately addressed these issues, presenting an unmet need for treatments targeting key tumor features, such as the T-antigen. The inventors have developed an innovative cell-based therapy that targets the T-antigen, a key tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA), enhancing the potential treatment of a wide range of metastatic carcinomas. The technology addresses the core challenge in current cancer therapies, where patients either do not respond robustly or do not have a durable response to immunotherapy. This solution incorporates a novel lectin-based targeting domain, leveraging high avidity interactions between lectins and glycans, yielding a robust anti-tumor response. This innovative therapy reduces the possibility of cancer cells escaping treatment and disrupts metastatic tolerance by targeting lymph node metastases. Applications: Cancer immunotherapy, Treatment for metastatic solid malignancies. Advantages: Novel targeting: First cell therapy to target T-antigen in a peptide-agnostic manner, Enhanced efficacy: Leverages high avidity interactions resulting in robust anti-tumor response compared to traditional therapies, Durable response: Targets functional mediators of disease progression rendering evolutionary tumor escape less likely, Reducing the metastatic capacity of the tumor, Metastasis disruption: Potential to target metastases and enhance the overall immune response to immunotherapy, Specificity: Targets aberrant glycosylation seen in tumors, reducing harm to healthy tissues.",

Targeting specific cell types or states within complex mixtures of cells is a significant challenge in research and medicine. Current methods for targeting cells often lack the precision required to manipulate subsets of cells, such as cancerous or immune cells. This lack of specificity hinders the development of advanced therapies that could precisely eliminate pathogenic cells or modify specific cell populations for therapeutic purposes, such as in cancer treatment or immune cell therapies. Additionally, current RNA-based technologies often lack the flexibility to respond to multiple RNA inputs, limiting their utility in a broad range of applications. To address this challenge, Stanford researchers have developed ModulADAR, a novel solution that enables precise control of gene expression triggered by specific RNA sequences, allowing for the targeted manipulation of cells based on their type or state. This technology uses a modular RNA sensing system that incorporates ADAR editing, enabling the activation of mRNA translation only in the presence of predefined RNA triggers. This selective expression mechanism allows for the targeted activation in specific cell types or states, such as tumor cells or immune cells in vivo. Moreover, this modular system removes previous sequence constraints and provides greater flexibility, sensitivity, and specificity. This innovation opens new possibilities for developing precise RNA therapeutics and advancing research in molecular biology, cancer treatment, and immunology.

    "ip_description": "Hydrogen that is free of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is a key vector to fuel a net-zero emissions economy, but today's H2 is sourced from fossil fuels mostly by the highly emissions-intensive processes of steam methane reforming (SMR) or coal gasification. Water electrolysis, the only viable technology that can produce CO2-free H2 today, produces H2 at costs 3\u20134 times higher (~$4/kg) than SMR and will have difficulty achieving the target $1/kg H2 production cost target of the US Dept. of Energy H2 Earthshot. Methane pyrolysis is a technology that could reach the $1/kg-H2 production target given that the energy intensity of H2 production of methane pyrolysis is much lower than water electrolysis and given that the produced carbon byproduct can be sold to offset the H2 production cost. However, methane pyrolysis technologies have historically been stymied by catalyst deactivation via coking. With this technology, we developed a semi-continuous heterogeneous catalytic CH4 pyrolysis process to produce CO2-free H2 and high-value carbon consisting of the following cyclic steps: 1. CNT growth by concentrated CH4 pyrolysis in a fluidized-bed reactor 2. In situ CNT dislodging (i.e., inside the reactor) and CNT recovery and collection by vigorous fluidization with humidified argon. The term 'semi-continuous' is defined as a process that can run continuously without requiring cooldown of the reactor or removal of the catalyst from the reactor for catalyst regeneration. In a commercial process, this semi-continuous process would be operated in a continuous manner by flow switching between multiple reactors operating in parallel (pyrolysis, purge, regeneration, reduction, etc.). Applications: Hydrogen: ammonia/fertilizers, methanol, refining, steelmaking, fuel-cell vehicles; Carbon nanotubes: composites materials like carbon fiber, concrete, cement; structural materials, electronics, automotive, aerospace, sporting equipment, tires, rubber. Advantages: H2 production at high H2 yields and high CH4 conversion with negligible process CO2 production; Highly crystalline CNT co-production at high yields; In-situ CNT dislodging for repeated catalyst use; Simple, scalable heterogeneous catalyst made from abundant materials; Potential for $1/kg H2 production cost with further research and development.",

This advancement has significant potential in enhancing solar energy harvesting, night vision, cameras, and bioimaging technology. Triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) is particularly promising for these applications due to its low up-conversion thresholds and broadband, tunable absorption. However, current NIR-to-visible TTA-UC systems are significantly less efficient than their visible-to-visible counterparts. For example, the current best NIR-to-visible TTA-UC solid-state devices, made of PbS quantum dots and rubrene, are limited by (1) low absorption of NIR photons, (2) low energy transfer rates, and (3) low conversion efficiency, which restricts their broader application. The Stanford team proposed a novel device architecture enabling strongly absorbing PbS films with improved efficiencies. Key innovations include (1) a 5-tetracene carboxylic acid interlayer to improve film homogeneity and upconversion efficiencies, and (2) a gold-based nanostructure to enhance absorption and emissive properties, yielding a fivefold improvement over control devices. Applications include photovoltaics, cameras/photodetectors, night vision, anti-counterfeiting, and bio-imaging. Advantages include access to sub-silicon bandgap photons (NIR photons beyond 1100nm), higher upconversion efficiencies, enhanced absorption and emissivity, and compatibility with solid-state device fabrication processes.",

Inventors in Stanford's Engleman lab discovered that these types of tumors grow faster in mice rendered obese through a high fat diet. Because macrophages play an important role in diseases associated with obesity and are present in high frequency in tumors, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) may contribute to this accelerated tumor growth. TAMs in tumors implanted into obese mice promote tumor growth, since their depletion from these mice results in slower tumor growth. TAMs in the tumors of obese mice express high levels of molecules that blunt immune activation of macrophages (in contrast to macrophages in obese mice that are outside of tumors), and obese mice in which the genes encoding these molecules are absent do not display accelerated tumor growth. Agents that neutralize or inhibit the functions of these molecules are expected to have therapeutic activity against tumors in the setting of obesity, including monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, and genetic approaches including RNAi that can knock down the expression of these molecules. Conversely, since these molecules inhibit macrophage-mediated immune inflammation, agents that enhance the signaling of these molecules may prove useful in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",

Populations of CAR-Treg cells are bimodal with respect to expression of the surface marker CD39, where the cytotoxic potential of these cell population depends on the expression of CD39. Selection for a CD39+ CAR-Treg population provides for a population with significantly reduced cytotoxic risk toward the cell population targeted by the CAR. Conversely, selecting the CD39- CAR-Treg subgroup can enhance cytotoxicity toward CAR-targeted cells. The CD39+ cell subgroup has potential to improved immunoregulatory function, which are useful in the treatment of autoimmune disease, to provide tolerance in transplantation, to promote wound healing or tissue regeneration etc. The CD39- cell populations on the other hand can be used for depletion of targeted populations, e.g. in cancer, depletion of undesirable antigen-presenting cells such as those present in transplantation rejection, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have found that sialylated Fc ligands can be used to modulate immune responses to respiratory viral infections. Severe respiratory viral infections can trigger an aberrant inflammatory response that damages lung tissue and compromises gas exchange in the alveolar space, potentially leading to lethal complications such as respiratory failure. Immunoglobulins, comprised of Fc and Fab regions, regulate this inflammatory response, affecting the severity of viral diseases and effectiveness of vaccines. The Fc region is relatively constant among different antibodies in the same class, while the Fab region, also known as the antigen-binding fragment, is highly variable. Current immunoglobulin treatments for respiratory viral infections involve antibodies with Fab regions specific to the target viral protein, which limits their usage against different types of viral infections. Researchers at Stanford have shown that intravenous administration of immunoglobulin G with sialylated Fc domain, or even sialylated Fc ligand alone, helps preserve lung function after respiratory viral infection (Figure 1). The addition of sialic acid induces conformational changes that promote interactions with anti-inflammatory SIGN receptors. This approach can be applied against any viral strain, eliminating the need for adjustments when novel viral strains and mutations emerge.",

Quality control of gene therapy products is key to effective and safe clinical deployment. One hurdle to appropriate quality control is that most clinical AAV vectors do not transduce efficiently in tissue culture systems, making it difficult to measure titer and potency, which are important for quality assurance and dosing. Currently, the quality control of gene therapy products based on AAV vectors consists of determining the physical characteristics of the particles and a crude measure of \"genome titer,\" which does not directly measure the ability of the viral particle to infect cells. This can lead to viral preparation varying widely in their quality and potency. To allow for direct in vitro measurement of AAV potency, Stanford inventors have created a cell line with greatly enhanced susceptibility to AAV transduction. By tuning AAV receptor (AAVR) expression and inhibiting one key gene, the inventors have engineered AAV-Titer, cell lines that are highly suitable for functional titration and potency assay development for clinical gene therapy. Applications: Quality control and R&D of clinical gene therapies. Advantages: More accurate and consistent titer measurement for AAVs used in clinical gene therapies.

    "ip_description": "The recognition of peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes by T cells is the cornerstone of cellular immunity, enabling the elimination of infected or tumoral cells. pMHC can thus be leveraged as a detection tool for T cells. The molecule naturally exists in a monomeric form, which impedes easy detection of T cells due to their weak equilibrium dissociation with the lymphocyte. To overcome this limitation, inventors at Stanford have developed a flexible pMHC display system on a self-assembling protein scaffold. Termed a spheromer, the platform has high compatibility with currently available pMHC molecules and streptavidin reagents that are routinely used for T cell analysis. Due to its increased specificity and sensitivity, the pMHC-spheromer platform overcomes the current limitations of existing T cell detection platforms. The platform is a valuable tool that can be used for the detection, isolation, and activation of antigen-specific T cells, enabling the successful tracking and modulation of the adaptive immune response.\n\nApplications:\n- Detection and quantitation of disease-relevant T-cells\n- Disease tracking, such as immunity in vaccinated individuals\n- Induction of antigen-specific immunological tolerance to treat autoimmune conditions\n\nAdvantages:\n- Greater detection efficiency than any commonly used pMHC multimer reagents\n- Customizable system enabling addition of co-stimulator molecules\n- Modulation of anti-tumor/anti-viral immunity by inducing antigen-specific responses",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have discovered a first-in-class covalent inhibitor that binds to activated Fis1 and prevents mitochondrial fission and dysfunction. Mitochondria, essential for cellular function, undergo dynamic processes of fusion and fission and balancing the two is critical to retain optimal function. Fis1 protein responds to cellular stress by recruiting Drp1 to mitochondria and driving excessive fission. This process is known to cause mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction and contribute to pathogenesis of variety of health conditions (such as neurodegeneration, inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases). Previously, the molecular mechanism of activation of Fis1 during stress was unknown and thus hard to target. Now, researchers have identified the mechanism of Fis1 activation and discovered a first-in-class covalent inhibitor of activated Fis1. The small molecule covalently binds to activated Fis1, preventing pathological fission and protecting against oxidative stress-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction. These compounds have potential to be developed as therapeutics for a number of disease conditions with underlying mitochondrial pathologies that currently have no approved therapies. Applications: Treating diseases impacting mitochondrial fission, including neurodegeneration, inflammatory conditions, and cardiovascular diseases. Advantages: First-of-its-kind molecule to covalently bind to activated Fis1, prevents pathological mitochondrial fission without affecting physiological mitochondrial fission.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a 3D-printed biodegradable zinc implant with mechanical properties suitable for structural support after core decompression in osteonecrosis patients. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a debilitating disease characterized by collapse of the femoral head due to an interruption in blood supply to mesenchymal and hematopoietic cells. Early diagnosis allows preservation of most of the femoral head through a procedure called core decompression. In this procedure, a path is drilled into the bone to stimulate new bone formation and blood vessels ingrowth. An implant is then inserted into the drill hole to provide structural support and guide tissue ingrowth. To date, these implants have been porous scaffolds made of nondegradable metals. Biodegradable metals can allow for more complete bone growth as the implant gradually degrades. Stanford researchers have found that an implant made of zinc or zinc alloy in a customized 3D form can bear the load after core compression while promoting osteogenesis. They used laser powder bed fusion to 3D-print the metal into the desired geometry (Figure 1). Their prototypes featured cylindrical shapes with lattice structures, but the design can be adjusted to create any specific degradation profile for enhanced vascularization. Applications: Core decompression surgery for osteonecrosis, Femoral head, Humeral head. Advantages: Biodegradable, Better osseointegration due to enhanced osteogenesis and angiogenesis, Load bearing capacity of nonbiodegradable metal implants, Degradation properties can be tuned.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed an innovative AI-driven solution that leverages the BERT-based AI model to automatically classify patient-provider messages into 12 distinct categories, reducing clinician workload and enhancing workflow efficiency in healthcare settings. In healthcare communication, there has been a dramatic rise in secure patient-provider messaging, particularly Patient Medical Advice Requests (PMARs), which enables patients to seek medical advice, request medication refills, schedule appointments, and discuss their health concerns directly with their healthcare providers. Currently, there is no effective way of sorting these messages without involving manual examination. Moreover, this surge in PMARs has introduced several challenges like the lack of efficient processing methods and workforce capacity to handle PMARs, leading to clinician burnout and inefficiencies in patient care. To address these critical challenges, Stanford researchers from Quadrant Health and Stanford's Healthcare Applied Research Team have developed an innovative AI solution using the BERT algorithm to automate categorizing patient-provider messages. BERT is designed to understand the context and semantics of text, making it highly effective at categorizing unstructured and multidimensional messages like PMARs. The model was trained on PMARs from online patient portals to categorize patient-provider messages into 12 distinct classes including medication, scheduling, paperwork, orders, results, data entry, referral, and review level. By automating the classification of PMARs, we eliminate the need for manual review and sorting by clinicians, enhancing workflow efficiency and reducing burnout. In summary, our innovative AI solution addresses the critical problem of managing the surge in PMARs by automating the categorization process, thereby reducing clinician workload and improving overall efficiency in patient-provider communication. Applications: First-of-its-kind, comprehensive approach to patient message categorization, Healthcare providers, hospitals and Electronic Health Record (EHR) system developers. Advantages: Integrates with EHR systems, allowing for automated workflows, Reduction in clinician workload, Improved workflow efficiency and minimizing delays in patient communication, High accuracy and efficiency in patient message categorization, Scalable and adaptable.",

The tool, which uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data as input, is called CytoTRACE and is based on the premise that less differentiated cells express a larger number of genes. CytoTRACE has been validated across 42 scRNA-seq datasets and outcompeted ~19,000 other features in predicting the differentiation status of single cells. The platform can identify markers to isolate regenerative cells in normal human tissues and target tumor-initiating cells that drive recurrence in cancer. CytoTRACE can be applied independently of tissue, platform, and species, with no prior knowledge required. The inventors have validated their discovery pipeline in data from human breast cancer patients. CytoTRACE identified a new target, GULP1, and demonstrated that the knockdown of this gene abrogates the growth of human breast cancers xenografted in mice. Applications include target discovery in oncology and regenerative medicine, identification of tumor-initiating cells, identification of novel stem cell and tumor cell populations, biomarker identification in oncology and cellular regeneration, characterization of cellular hierarchies in complex cell populations, and assessment of chromatin accessibility on a single-cell level. Advantages include applicability across all cell types, tissues, and species, ability to be applied independently of sequencing protocol, no need for a 'reference' point or prior knowledge of differentiation status, and outperforming many leading computational models.",

Uniform heating of volumetric media to high temperatures is the foundation of many physical and chemical reaction systems that involve elevated processing temperatures or endothermic heat requirements. The predominant source of heating for most high temperature reactor systems is chemical fuel combustion, which produces significant carbon emissions. Inductive heating is an established method for clean, efficient heating. However, an underlying challenge to date is understanding how inductive heating can be adapted to heat volumetric media efficiently and uniformly, which requires unique specification of the susceptor and power electronics. Researchers at Stanford University have incorporated a metamaterial mesh susceptor and high-efficiency electronics to create a sustainable thermochemical reactor that can produce a customized volumetric heating profile. Their invention electrifies the heating process by using magnetic induction to produce high frequency currents. The mesh susceptor in the core of the reactor can be tailored to support electrically conductive properties that enable high efficiency and uniform inductive heating within the entire reactor volume. This invention can assist in decarbonizing many heavy industrial processes. Applications include carbon dioxide capture, oil and gas production, steam cracking, limestone decomposition, cement and ceramic manufacturing, materials processing through pyrolysis, and hydrogen sulfur capture and utilization. Advantages include decarbonization, uniform heating at high temperatures, efficiency, high reaction rates, smaller size, lower cost, and scalability.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed tissue-based profiling by deep sequencing for detection of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) by tracking patient-specific tumor mutations in post-chemotherapy tissue samples, enabling a highly sensitive, molecular-level assessment of residual cancer. Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the U.S, with over 260,000 cases diagnosed annually. Despite advancements in treatment, more than 40,000 Americans still die each year due to metastatic breast cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is essential for shrinking tumors before surgery in locally advanced cases, yet current methods to detect residual disease post-NAC lack sensitivity. Pathological assessments and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) tests often miss microscopic traces, leading to undetected residual disease and undertreatment of patients. A more accurate detection method is urgently needed to guide patient selection for adjuvant treatments, inform targeted therapies, and reduce recurrence risks. To address this need, Stanford researchers have developed tissue-based deep sequencing for Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) detection, which offers a highly sensitive approach to identify residual cancer cells in tumor tissue after NAC. Unlike traditional pathology, which relies on visual examination, spatial-MRD (sMRD) uses ultra-deep sequencing to detect molecular traces of cancer across different regions of the tumor tissue, even when no residual cells are detectable under the microscope. In pilot studies, s-MRD demonstrated superior accuracy and sensitivity compared to traditional pathology, detecting molecular residual disease in resection tissues where pathology was negative but the cancer later recurred. With its potential to outperform existing methods, s-MRD represents a promising advancement for improving breast cancer outcomes and making it a valuable tool for global oncology care. Applications: Cancer diagnostics, Prognostic tool for personalized treatment, Companion diagnostic in drug trials. Advantages: High sensitivity detection of minimal residual disease at a molecular level, Personalized profiling of residual cancer, Alternative to manual pathology, especially beneficial in resource-limited settings, Adaptable to multiple cancer types beyond breast cancer.",

Ureteral stents are a standard tool in urological procedures, primarily used to ensure urine drainage from the kidney to the bladder after interventions like ureteroscopy. While effective, the current stent designs frequently lead to stent-related complications in over 80% of patients, causing symptoms such as pain, bladder spasms, and urine reflux. These issues often result in unplanned clinical visits, contributing to patient discomfort and healthcare costs. The market has yet to see a ureteral stent that effectively addresses these root causes. To address this need, Stanford researchers have developed UreStent - an innovative ureteral stent designed to tackle stent-related complications (SRCs). UreStent is engineered to provide all the benefits of a standard ureteral stent, such as ensuring drainage and preventing ureteral obstruction, while minimizing SRCs by prioritizing patient comfort and clinical efficacy. Key design features include a flexible polymer conduit for adaptable placement, and a distal tip with collapsible tube and a flexible retention cone to prevent reflux, reducing kidney irritation and bladder spasms.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have designed a novel tricuspid annuloplasty ring that minimizes the risk of interrupting cardiac conduction during implantation. Tricuspid regurgitation is a prevalent heart condition in which the tricuspid valve fails to close completely during ventricular contraction. The disrupted unidirectional blood flow could lead to abnormal pressure or volume overload. Patients with moderate to severe cases may require annuloplasty, where a ring device is implanted over the annulus around the tricuspid valve to support valve leaflets. While securing the device, sutures often inadvertently cross the bundle of His in the septum, disrupting heart conduction. To avoid this complication, there is a critical need for alternate annuloplasty devices. Researchers in the Woo Lab at Stanford have created a modular annuloplasty device that avoids suture placement in conduction tissue. Its most basic form is a C-shaped band with a wide gap between the two ends to avoid traversing over the septal leaflet. The device can be further secured by adding a flexible polymer that joins the ends of the device. Alternatively, the ends can be conjoined with a bridge-like structure that bends away from the valve. The bridge is angled to conform to the septal wall and aorta, improving retention. Applications: Tricuspid valve annuloplasty. Advantages: No suture placement in conduction tissue, Reduced need for pacemakers, Improved retention strength, Reduced recurrent regurgitation.",

Mitral annuloplasty ring implantation is one of the most common mitral valve surgeries to reduce mitral regurgitation by establishing proper leaflet coaptation. Mitral ring sizing is a difficult process whereby a surgeon decides how much to reduce the size of the annulus while the heart is arrested. Methods currently do not exist to adjust the ring size once the heart has been restarted, and small sizing errors often result in persistent regurgitation, which requires the surgeon to re-arrest the heart and re-perform the annuloplasty procedure. To avoid exposing patients to this additional risk, Stanford researchers have developed an annuloplasty ring with a mechanism to adjust its size after the heart has been closed and re-animated. They used custom folding and semiflexible material technologies to enable asymmetric annulus constriction via sutures routed through the ring. The suture-based tightening mechanism exits the left atrium and allows for post-implantation adjustments based on real-time heart function. This invention enables surgeons to address minor sizing errors without extensive reoperation.",

State of the art manufacturing of integrated Ti:Sapphire technology relies on costly, size limited, highly doped Ti:Sapphire wafers which are limited in size, doping control, and uniformity.\n\nStanford researchers start using a standard, undoped, sapphire substrate, in which a near surface level Titanium source is created via implantation of or deposition. This layer can be patterned via masked implantation, or lithographically deposited. High temperature annealing improves the doping layer quality.

Finally, the undoped sapphire portions of the original material are removed, leaving a wafer-scale thin-film Ti:Sapphire platform.

Multiple integrated microfluidic channels introduce single droplets of consistent size onto the optoelectronic substrate. The optoelectronics precisely encapsulates and decapsulates individual solid supports (i.e., polystyrene microbeads) with corresponding picoliter volume reagent microdroplets. Complete encapsulation ensures uniform reagent exposure, which reduces errors and improves the final yield rate significantly.

The Hesselink Group successfully demonstrated the on-chip enzymatic oligonucleotide coupling reaction and are adapting the platform for a wider range of reactions. This light-orchestrated microdroplet reactor platform provides quicker, more affordable, more efficient, and sustainable oligonucleotide synthesis.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted between humans and animals. Viral mutation and zoonotic transfer are anticipated to lead to future pandemics and largescale outbreaks. Indeed, the COVID-19 respiratory disease likely originated in bats, and led to a pandemic with over 750 million cases and nearly seven million deaths worldwide. To date, there are a limited number of active pharmaceutical agents that are effective at treating COVID-19 or other coronavirus infections in patients. There is therefore an urgent need for therapeutics capable of treating infections arising from known coronaviruses, as well as from new coronaviruses that will arise in the future. For instance, the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies was a major advance in the treatment of COVID-19. However, known mAb therapies gradually become ineffective with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The inventors have developed improved fusion proteins containing an antibody domain, that binds a highly conserved epitope of betacoronavirus Spike proteins on the S2 subunit, and an ACE2 domain, which serves at the neutralizing domain. SARS-CoV-2 variants are less likely to escape the binding of fusion proteins than neutralizing mAbs targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins. Applications include use as a broad and high-potency therapeutic against coronavirus infections, fusion protein therapies which are likely to inhibit any betacoronavirus that uses the highly conserved ACE2 as a receptor, making them suitable for stockpiling in anticipation of the next betacoronavirus jumping from animals to humans, and use in high-risk patients with complex medication regimes. Advantages include greater breadth of protection than previously described fusion proteins, the use of fusion proteins with enzymatically inactive ACE2 (the virus' own host receptor), which prevents adverse side effects of administering fusion proteins with active ACE2 domain, more efficacious in vitro activity than known anti-coronavirus mAbs, broad neutralizing range that includes all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV-1, and expected to have few, if any, interactions with other medications a patient may be taking.",

The inventors have developed methods for the biomanufacturing of large-scale tissue constructs. This includes methods for preparing a tissue and allowing the printed cell structure to incubate in the biocompatible matrix. The printed cell structure is generally removed from the biocompatible matrix when it has sufficient strength to be self-supporting or has developed into a contiguous tissue. Applications include: The biocompatible matrix can comprise a foam, emulsion, colloid, granular medium, or gel. The biocompatible matrix can include one or more types of diverse growth media or can include polyacrylic acid. The cell bioink can comprise a slurry of compacted organoids such that they are deformed from their equilibrium shape. The cell bioink has a cell density similar to that of native tissues, and it is substantially free of exogenous material such as collagen or gelatin. Advantages include: An extended time can be allowed for at least a portion of the cells in the printed cell structure to develop into a contiguous tissue. Depending on the type of cells, this can range from 24 hours up to 15-to-50 days, unlike other state-of-the-art methods where cells must be removed from the printing matrix almost immediately. The biocompatible matrix can include a rheological modifier to tune the self-healing time of the matrix; a rapid, self-healing matrix can help alleviate deformation of the printed cell structure due to the stiffness of the matrix from the high yield stress during printing.

    "ip_description": "Current methods of genetically-engineered cells require precise integration of genetic material. Genotyping is usually used to detect genetic edits; however, it's difficult to track the exact changes made in each individual cell in a large cellular mixture, especially when the cells receive multiple edits. While whole genome genotyping is available to track each cell in a mixture, the technique is expensive and time-consuming. Thus, there is a need for additional methodologies that enables quicker and cost-efficient tracking of genetic edits within cells of interest. The Fraser lab at Stanford has invented a genetic engineering platform that enables multiple cellular gene editing while tracking the exact edits being made. The invention consists of two or more CRISPEY modules covalently produced by the vector, where the combination of edits that will be made across all modules are predetermined. Each module applies edits of interest tagged with unique sequences that can be easily genotyped by DNA sequencing or other methods. When needed, the intended combination of precise edits for each can also be inferred by Sanger sequencing, NGS, or other detection methods. Unlike existing methods, the invention can be applied to a mixture of cells as well as single cell or clonal cell lineages, and provides an efficient, high-throughput, and low-cost method for genetic and cellular engineering. Applications include tracking relative abundance of cells targeted by a mixture of edit in parallel, such as high-throughput precision editing genetic screens to improve industrial microbial growth, select strains for improving crop yield, track edited cell populations treated by genetic editing medicine, and track edited cell populations used in-cell therapy. Advantages include a high-throughput, cost-effective method compared to existing methods, does not require integrating of vector into the genome, detection of the first edit (label) that installs the unique sequencing indicates that the edit tool is functional, and higher likelihood of the rest of the cells containing the second edit that is intended, important for isolating edited cells of interest. Edits made to the same target cell iteratively can be tracked by reading past unique barcodes installed into the genetic material. The barcode label can also be associated with antibiotic markers or other markers that allow cell purification.",

The significance of theranostics therefore lies in its ability to personalize and optimize medical treatments by tailoring them to individual patients. B7H3 is a transmembrane protein, that has recently been identified as a pan-cancer antigen with dense expression across a multitude of cancer types and with restricted expression in normal tissue, rendering B7H3-targeted radiotheranostics a viable treatment option for millions of patients. Despite the promise of B7H3, no peptide ligands have been identified. Furthermore, because the protein lacks structural and functional characterization there is currently no a priori way to design ligands. Stanford researchers have discovered B7H3-targeting peptides from peptide phage display that can be used for cancer theranostic applications, such as for diagnostic imaging and peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy. This would allow for both the diagnosis and treatment of various advanced or refractory cancers lacking other viable therapies. The newly identified peptide is the first peptide identified specific to B7H3, and when chelated to 68Ga and 177Lu, the first radionuclide therapy for B7H3. Researchers predict that the B7H3 peptide-targeted radiotherapeutics would have preferential uptake in tumor tissue where the majority of DNA damage would occur, with timely elimination from clearance organs. Stage of Development: In vitro and in vivo: proof of concept in cell lines. Applications: Cancer diagnostic, Radionuclide cancer therapy, Cancer theranostics.

This invention enables nanosecond image gating and modulation in low-light conditions, opening new applications for wide-field imaging such as fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). This technology enables the first wide-field lifetime camera that is compatible with single-molecule microscopy. Existing sensors for wide-field nanosecond imaging (e.g. time-of-flight cameras, SPAD arrays, and gated intensifiers) sacrifice performance and are not compatible with low-light applications in bioimaging and fluorescence microscopy. The researchers have demonstrated the use of electro-optic wide-field imaging gates for nanosecond temporal resolution with high photon collection efficiency. Their method enables wide-field FLIM in a single exposure image on any standard camera sensor. By acquiring all pixels in parallel they demonstrate 5 orders of magnitude improvement in imaging speeds compared to single photon counting. They have also demonstrated 39 MHz image modulation for fluorescence lifetime microscopy of single molecules at high frame rate. This allows FLIM applications in super-resolution microscopy and observations of single-molecule dynamics such as FRET. Prototypes have been tested on commercial microscopes. On-going work: Researchers are continuing to improve the technique to allow larger imaging field-of-view, higher frequency operation, and improved electro-optic configurations.

Many studies have successfully demonstrated directed differentiation of iPSCs into cardiomyocytes. However, further assembling and maturing the iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to mimic the mechanics of the native heart tissue remains a challenge. To overcome this challenge, studies have created microenvironments resembling that of primary cardiomyocytes during development: micropillar structures were placed to provide a 3D environment and exogenous cues were applied to facilitate anisotropic alignment of cells for coordinated contraction and electrical conduction. The engineered tissue's maturation was improved but still not comparable to the native heart. Researchers at Stanford have devised a platform that provides a more biomimetic microenvironment (Figure 1). Using advanced 3D bioprinting technology, cells were printed with soft silicone in preferred arrangements. The print was placed in an electrically conductive bioreactor that can be actuated to apply torsional force or pneumatic pressure to the silicone to introduce twisting and contractile cardiac mechanics that the micropillar approach neglected to include. This system has the potential to form functional macro-level heart tissues from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Applications include cardiac tissue engineering, drug testing, disease modeling, and developmental studies. Advantages include mimicking the complex contractile pattern of the native heart tissue better than other existing systems and potential for personalized treatment.",

Thirty nine million people worldwide are living with HIV infection. Autologous transplantation of specific hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is the only known cure for HIV-1 infection. However, this treatment is extremely limited due to the rarity of specific matched donors, the morbidities associated with allogeneic transplantation, and the prevalence of HIV-1 strains resistant to select gene knockout treatments alone. To circumvent these limitations, Stanford researchers genetically engineered HSPCs that secrete antibodies against various targets, including but not limited to HIV, PCSK9, and TNF-alpha.

Autonomous mRNA switches can provide dynamic regulation within cellular immunotherapies and offer broad utility in next-generation mRNA therapeutics, such as engineering chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells _in vivo_.\n\n_Ex vivo_ CAR T cell therapy has shown significant success in treating oncology patients and combating malignant tumors. However, this approach is limited by the expensive and time-consuming _ex vivo_ production process, which can take several weeks, and the challenge of administering only a single effective dose to patients, leading to potential tumor relapse. In contrast, _in vivo_ CAR T cell therapy offers a promising solution by directly engineering T cells within patients using mRNA therapeutics. This innovative approach enables rapid and customizable production, with the transient nature of mRNA therapies allowing for precise temporal control of therapeutic doses. Nevertheless, advancements are needed to develop technologies capable of sensing relevant biological conditions and tightly regulating the translation of therapeutic payloads. Novel strategies for controlling mRNA expression in T cells will enable the development of _in vivo_ T cell therapies that can alleviate T cell dysfunction while preserving the protective immune responses required for human health.\n\nNovel engineered UTR sequences resulted in RNA elements that can sense T cell signals and modulate therapeutic mRNA expression as ON/OFF switches. These mRNA switches have been shown to induce the translation of genetic payloads upon T-cell activation. The use of these mRNA switches to control the translation of a CAR in engineered T cells resulted in the expression of the CAR and the killing of antigen-positive tumor cells. Importantly, when co-cultured with antigen-negative cells, there was no difference in CAR expression or killing when compared to baseline. Consequently, autonomous mRNA switches have the potential to enhance cellular immunotherapies and enable the development of _in vivo_ CAR T cell therapies.\n\n**Stage of Development:**\nPreclinical \u2013 _in vitro_ data\nContinued research \u2013 _in vivo_ demonstration of efficacy and further description of switches that capture other immune cell states (e.g. T cell exhaustion, NK cell activation, etc.).

Kidney stones are clusters of minerals and salts that form in the urinary tract, potentially causing severe pain from urinary tract obstruction, renal injury, or infections. During ureteroscopy, an endoscope is inserted through the urethra to break up larger stones with lasers or ultrasound. Fragments are either retrieved or, if small, allowed to pass naturally. Unfortunately, residual fragments and dust often cause recurrent symptomatic obstruction and stone regrowth. Therefore, there is a critical need for a more efficient clearance method. In response, vacuum-assisted sheaths have been recently introduced. However, they remove renal fluid along with the debris, necessitating fluid infusion to sustain the renal pressure. Stanford researchers at the Zhao Lab have designed a safer and more efficient kidney stone fragments and dusts extraction device that can be used together with kidney stone breaking devices.

This innovative technology, capable of metabolizing CO2 at low, atmospheric concentrations, offers a promising approach to large-scale carbon sequestration, potentially contributing to global efforts to remove tens of gigatons of carbon dioxide annually by 2030. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a primary contributor to global warming, with atmospheric concentrations steadily increasing due to human activities. Traditional CO2 capture methods often require energy-intensive processes to concentrate and convert the gas, and there are limited end uses for CO2, reducing incentive for CO2 capture and limiting the large-scale applicability. Biological systems, particularly CO2-respiring microbes, offer a promising alternative due to their ability to metabolize CO2 at low concentrations and ambient conditions. Unlike energy-intensive chemical processes, these commonly anaerobic microorganisms can directly capture and convert dilute CO2 into useful organic compounds, operating efficiently in moderately alkaline solutions at ambient temperatures and pressures. Understanding the mechanisms of microbial CO2 metabolism and the conditions that facilitate it could lead to the development of efficient, large-scale carbon capture and conversion technologies. Preliminary experiments with the microbial CO2 capture and conversion system demonstrated successful production of reduced carbon compounds from indoor air. Importantly, the system consumed CO2 to levels below average atmospheric concentrations at sea level, indicating effective carbon sequestration. These results suggest that the microbial technology is capable of both capturing and converting dilute atmospheric CO2. Consequently, this approach has the potential to significantly contribute to global carbon sequestration efforts and transform climate change mitigation strategies by offering a sustainable method to remove CO2 from the atmosphere while producing valuable organic compounds.

Subsurface thermal energy storage addresses key challenges faced by solar thermal energy: intermittency and the need for large-scale, long-term storage. Instead of using above ground insulated tanks with exotic molten salts for energy storage, this method (see Figure 1) uses the vast pore volume of depleted oil and gas fields for heat storage, which reduces above-ground infrastructure, cuts costs, increases the amount of energy that may be stored, is scalable, and potentially reduces heat losses. The heat is stored in the reservoir until there is a demand for energy. The energy is brought to the surface and can be used to generate electricity or process heat, making the system adaptable for different industrial applications, and potentially converting solar thermal energy to a base load renewable energy.\n\nApplications:\n- Clean energy:\n  - Concentrated solar energy\n  - Steam-powered electricity generation\n- Thermal oil recovery (TEOR) and decarbonization in oil production\n- Industrial processes requiring heat\n\nAdvantages:\n- Reduces costs\n  - Less expensive than molten salts used in conventional solar heat storage\n  - Significantly reduces the need for above-ground infrastructure and costs compared to conventional systems\n  - Leverages existing oil field infrastructure\n- Scalable, large-scale storage with expanded energy capacity\n- Reduces heat loss\n- Dual functionality and adaptable for different industrial applications\n- Reduces carbon dioxide footprint of thermally enhanced oil recovery - shifts fuel from natural gas to solar radiation\n- Balances the daily and seasonal variations of solar radiation\n- Reduces operational risk - integration of existing geothermal and oil extraction techniques reduces operational risk and leverages geothermal technology to handle steam and mitigate issues like scale formation in wellbore equipment",

    "ip_description": "Industry, government, and private investment in CO2 capture is growing to address climate change. Without carbon utilization, however, high costs impede large scale capture efforts. Alexander Al Zubeidi, a Stanford post doc in the D-Lab, has developed an inexpensive, scalable gas flow cell based system to convert atmospheric CO2 to other hydrocarbon based chemicals (like ethylene) using light and excess renewable electricity. In the prototype system, gas enters the reactor cell via a gas flow channel, flows over the gas diffusion electrode covered in copper nanoparticles and electrolyte solution at ambient temperature. Visible light (450-800 nm) enters through the cell window, exciting copper nanoparticle electrons that reduce CO2 to ethylene. These electrolyzers can produce hydrocarbon based chemicals and syngas, a mixture of H2 and O2. Unlike competing electrolyzers that are built to operate on large scales, with long payback periods that typically require high capacity factors, the D-Lab system (Figure 2) can operate when renewable energy is in excess, generating net-zero emissions and converting point-source CO2 emissions to high-value products. This inexpensive, scalable plasmonic gas flow reactor system provides cost effective carbon capture CO2 gas separation and storage while producing valuable feedstocks for the chemical industry or zero-carbon fuels. Applications include industrial chemical production, especially ethylene, green fuel / hydrocarbon based fuel production, and syngas production. Advantages include low cost ethylene production with high cap-ex return, compact, scalable and mass producible design, no purification of reactants, operates at ambient temperature, and does not require CH3.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed AutoABI, a deep learning system that predicts ankle-brachial index (ABI) from Doppler ultrasound sounds. This approach offers a new method for ABI measurements, particularly useful for patients with non-compressible arteries, such as those with diabetes. By analyzing Doppler sounds, AutoABI provides a straightforward way to assess peripheral artery disease (PAD) risk without traditional blood pressure cuffs. The system could improve the accessibility and efficiency of PAD diagnosis in point-of-care settings, where quick and accurate assessments are valuable.\n\nAnkle-brachial index (ABI) is a crucial diagnostic tool for peripheral artery disease (PAD), but current measurement methods face significant limitations. Traditional ABI assessment requires inflating a blood pressure cuff while using Doppler ultrasound to measure blood flow in the tibial arteries. However, this technique proves unreliable in patients with non-compressible arteries, a common condition in diabetics with PAD. These patients often have medial arterial calcification, leading to falsely elevated and unreliable ABI readings. The prevalence of diabetes and the increasing need for accurate PAD diagnosis underscores the importance of developing more versatile, point-of-care ABI measurement techniques. An improved method that can provide reliable ABI estimates without relying on blood pressure cuffs could significantly enhance PAD diagnosis and management, particularly in challenging patient populations.\n\nAutoABI, a deep learning system integrated into a hand-held Doppler device, successfully predicts ankle-brachial index (ABI) directly from audible Doppler sounds without the need for blood pressure cuffs. This innovative approach enables ABI measurements in patients with non-compressible arteries, a common issue in diabetics with PAD. The device's on-board computer processes Doppler signals in real-time, displaying results on an integrated touch screen for immediate clinical use. By offering a more versatile and accessible method for ABI assessment, AutoABI has the potential to significantly improve PAD diagnosis and management across various healthcare settings, from hospital wards to vascular labs.\n\n**Stage of Development:**\nPrototype\nContinued research: fully integrating the computer and deep learning computation within the Doppler device itself, eliminating the need for external processing and creating a self-contained, portable ABI measurement system.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD)\n*   Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements in patients with non-compressible arteries, such as diabetics\n*   Point-of-care vascular health assessments in clinics and hospital wards\n*   Integration into existing vascular lab equipment for enhanced capabilities\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   Eliminates the need for blood pressure cuffs in ABI measurements\n*   Provides reliable ABI estimates for patients with calcified arteries\n*   Increases accessibility of ABI testing in various clinical settings\n*   Offers real-time, on-device processing and results display\n*   Simplifies the ABI measurement process for healthcare providers\n*   Potential for improved PAD diagnosis rates and patient outcomes",

    "ip_description": "Researchers in Dr. Michelle Monje-Deisseroth's lab at Stanford have identified therapeutic targets for drug development to limit the spread of high-grade gliomas (HGGs). HGGs, including glioblastoma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, are a group of brain cancers with dire prognosis. They frequently invade a region of the brain called the subventricular zone (SVZ) and this spread correlates with decreased survival. Currently the only therapeutic approach to limit spreading into the SVZ is not optimal as it involves irradiation of the SVZ, which can cause very serious side effects. Thus, new targeted therapeutic strategies are needed. The inventors have determined that SVZ invasion is promoted by the secretion of pleiotrophin, which forms a complex with a group of proteins that acts as a chemoattractant for the glioma to the SVZ. Therapeutic agents that inhibit this chemoattractant complex, such as inhibitory nucleic acids, thus provide a strategy for treating HGGs. This technology provides potential new targets for drug development to limit the spread of deadly brain cancers. The inventors have identified pleiotrophin and its binding partners as key proteins secreted by cells in the SVZ that are necessary and sufficient for glioma invasion of the SVZ. Applications include drug development for new targets to treat gliomas and inhibitory nucleic acids (shRNA, siRNA, miRNA, ASOs) to treat HGG spread. Advantages include addressing an unmet medical need as the existing therapeutic strategy is non-optimal and providing new targets for therapeutic development.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have developed PVSeg, a tool that automatically segments vascular and perivascular compartments in brain MRI data. This innovative tool can identify non-demented individuals at increased risk of developing dementia and accelerated brain atrophy. PVSeg's metrics could serve as a screening tool, allowing early diagnosis of brain microvascular issues and potentially improving patient treatments and outcomes. Additionally, it could enrich clinical trials for treatments targeting cognitive decline by identifying suitable candidates at increased risk of future cognitive impairment, thereby reducing subject enrollment challenges and decreasing costs. Moreover, in clinical trials specifically targeting Alzheimer's disease pathology (amyloid-\u03b2 and tau), PVSeg's metrics can refine the selection of participants with a 'purer' form of preclinical Alzheimer's disease by identifying and screening out individuals with radiographic signs of vascular damage, improving efficiency and effectiveness of clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. Finally, PVSeg's metrics are suitable for longitudinal assessments, allowing the evaluation of treatment effects on the brain vasculature _in-vivo_.\n\nCerebral small vessel disease is a significant contributor to cognitive decline and dementia. Currently, clinicians use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect signs of vascular damage in the brain, such as white matter hyperintensities and microbleeds. However, these markers are often subtle in healthy individuals and lack quantitative precision. Recent advancements allow for the measurement of brain vasculature and perivascular spaces using standard T1-weighted MRI scans. Yet, current techniques have notable limitations: they are user-dependent, leading to potential inconsistencies, and lack inter-scanner reproducibility. These drawbacks hinder the execution of large-scale, longitudinal studies and clinical trials crucial for understanding the relationship between vascular changes and cognitive impairment over time. There is a clear need for a more robust, automated method to quantify cerebral vascular structures consistently across different MRI machines and over extended periods.\n\nA novel, fully automated algorithm has been developed to assess perivascular diameter and count of blood vessels with MRI-visible perivascular space in white matter and basal ganglia using standard 3D T1-weighted MRI scans. PVSeg demonstrates excellent inter-scanner and test-retest reproducibility, addressing key limitations of current methods. Importantly, the algorithm revealed significant associations between vascular metrics and dementia risk, as well as brain atrophy rates, in a large-scale study (>10,000 subjects). By enabling more efficient screening in clinical trials, PVSeg has the potential to substantially reduce required participant numbers and to refine their selection, thereby increasing trial power and reducing costs in dementia research.\n\n**Stage of Development:**\n\n*   Preclinical _in-vivo_\n*   Continued research - Further clinical applications of the algorithm are currently being explored at Stanford.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Assessment of cerebral small vessel disease and its relation to cognitive decline\n*   Early detection of individuals at high risk for dementia\n*   Enrichment of clinical trials for cognitive impairment and dementia\n*   Evaluation of treatment effects on brain vasculature _in-vivo_\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   Fully automated segmentation of vascular and perivascular compartments in brain MRI\n*   Excellent inter-scanner reproducibility and test-retest repeatability\n*   Robust performance in longitudinal studies\n*   Requires only standard T1-weighted MRI sequences, enabling widespread use\n*   Potential for significant cost reduction in clinical trials through improved participant selection",

Point of use tests are commonly conducted under scenarios where resources are scarce. They are utilized in order to rapidly detect and quantify multiple compounds of interest in biological, chemical and environmental samples. However, instrumentation cost, size and power requirements can severely limit utilization of point of use tests in resource-limited settings. Elimination of the instrumentation typically required to analyze or read point of use tests would enable modern diagnostics technologies to be employed more widely. This would provide users with real-time, actionable health and/or environmental information. Therefore to address the limitation of instrumentation, Stanford researchers developed a electrochemical lateral flow assay diagnostics platform that eliminates the need for expensive analyzers or reader instrumentation typically required for quantitative tests. Instead the eLFA communicates the presence or abundance of compounds of interest to a user wirelessly via a cell phone app. This advanced eLFA technology platform presents commercial opportunities as it is compatible with the two most widely utilized molecular diagnostics test formats, sandwich assays and competition assays.

Magnetic shielding protects vulnerable devices used in automotives, aerospace and aviation, telecommunications, data storage, medical imaging equipment, high precision instruments, and more. Permeability, magnetic saturation, thermal stability, and operating frequency range determine magnetic shield effectiveness. Iron has excellent magnetic saturation and thermal stability, but can only be used in the frequency range of 100 Hz due to eddy current losses. Fe-Si and other soft metal alloys are typically used, which are expensive and difficult to process. The Stanford researchers' additive manufacturing (AM) method leverages space-filling curves to increase the iron components frequency range three orders of magnitude to above 1 kHz, without affecting iron's saturation, permeability, or thermal stability. The process is easier, faster, and less expensive than industry standards, and resulting prototypes meet or outperform industry standard devices made from more resistive nanocrystalline and amorphous compositions, and laminate devices made from electrical steel.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed an approach to enable larger superconducting quantum systems that can likely span several refrigerators, necessitating connecting qubits across refrigerators efficiently. Current connectors are limited in its scalability. Superconducting coaxial cables have not been seriously considered for connecting qubits in neighboring dilution refrigerators because they lose quantum information too quickly at typical superconducting qubit frequencies (approximately 2-8 GHz). However, it is known that such cables are extremely low loss at low frequencies when the wavelength of light is comparable to the fridge-to-fridge separation. This invention enables qubits to be strongly coupled to the low-frequency modes of superconducting coaxial cables using a circuit that transduces quantum information from typical qubit frequencies down to a lower frequency, the so-called baseband, where the tradeoff between frequency-dependent loss and thermal fluctuations is optimized. Stage of Development: Proof of concept, Calculations demonstrated that this invention is significantly better than the current state-of-the-art as measured by two important figures of merit known as single-photon fidelity and quantum channel capacity.

    "ip_description": "Of the 1.4 million first time mothers giving vaginal birth in the United States, approximately 75% will experience tearing of their vagina or perineum. During labor, the pelvic floor stretches to accommodate fetal passage, and overstretching of this relatively inelastic tissue can result in tearing and permanent injury. Up to 7% of mothers will experience the most severe form of tears, where the laceration extends from the vaginal opening all the way to the anus and rectum, damaging the underlying tissues. These severe injuries require comprehensive repair, and put patients at increased risk of post-partum complications such as infections, wound dehiscence, and pain. Patients with severe tears are also more likely to experience long term sequelae of their injuries including incontinence, prolapse, and dyspareunia. These result in ongoing follow-up visits, out of pocket costs, and in some cases additional surgical procedures. The prevention of perineal trauma during childbirth remains a significant concern for maternal health.\n\nEvidence suggests that applying heat to the perineal area can potentially reduce the risk of trauma by increasing tissue elasticity and blood flow. However, current methods for delivering this heat, such as conductive heating pads or compresses, present challenges in achieving safe and effective temperatures. Conductive heat can easily lead to burns, especially in the sensitive perineal region of patients that are often under anesthesia. Most available equipment is not designed to provide the consistent, controlled heat necessary to induce beneficial changes at the tissue level. The development of an ultrasound-based heating device specifically for the perineum offers a promising solution to these challenges. By using ultrasound technology, heat can be applied more precisely and safely, reducing the risk of burns while delivering the optimal temperature needed to increase tissue elasticity and potentially lower the risk of perineal tears. This approach combines both safety and effectiveness, addressing the usability gaps in current heating methods and providing a novel intervention for childbirth-related perineal trauma prevention.\n\nInventors at Stanford have developed a handheld therapeutic device that uses ultrasound energy to heat the tissues of the perineum. The device consists of a reusable ultrasound unit with a single use disposable gel pad which will be exchanged between patients and can be easily replaced if soiled. The energy from the device improves pelvic floor elasticity by 1) changing the viscoelastic properties of the underlying tissue at a precisely controlled depth, 2) stimulating blood flow to improve tissue's resistance to tearing, and 3) inhibiting neural pathways that lead to over-contraction of the pelvic muscles during the delivery. The device provides a low-cost therapeutic solution that ensures sterility, patient comfort, and ease of use at the bedside.\n\n**Stage of Development**\n_Proof of Concept_ - The device is at the proof-of-concept stage. Existing literature supports the efficacy of heat in reducing perineal trauma, and we have successfully demonstrated that our ultrasound technology can safely heat tissues at the required depth without causing burns. This establishes a strong foundation for the device's potential in preventing perineal tears during childbirth. Further development is focused on optimizing the device for clinical use.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Perineal trauma\n*   Maternal health\n*   OB/GYN\n*   Labor and Delivery\n*   Medical device\n*   Therapeutic ultrasound\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   No existing commercial solutions aimed at reducing perineal tears during delivery\n*   Precise control of heat delivery: precision targeting and controlled temperature that ensures an optimal temperature at deeper tissues without overheating the skin\n*   Non-invasive and safe\n*   Portable and user-friendly design",

Ciliopathies are genetic disorders affecting multiple organ systems and reducing life expectancy. Joubert syndrome, a rare form of ciliopathy, is characterized by midbrain defects, ocular motor apraxia, and developmental delays. At least 35 genes critical for cilia function have been identified in these disorders. Ciliopathies can lead to renal failure, progressive blindness, and other severe complications.

The device is portable, disposable, and low-cost, enabling point-of-care assessment of disease. Classifying exosomes from patient plasma can be used as a diagnostic for rapid, sensitive, and non-invasive diagnoses of brain cancers. Glioblastoma detection poses significant challenges due to its complex nature and similarity to other brain lesions. Current diagnostic methods, primarily relying on MRI and biopsy, are limited in their ability to accurately distinguish glioblastoma from other conditions or detect early recurrence. The heterogeneity of glioblastoma further complicates diagnosis, requiring extensive molecular and histopathological analysis as per WHO guidelines. These methods are often costly, time-consuming, and not universally accessible. With a median survival of less than 15 months and a 90% recurrence rate, there is an urgent need for more efficient and accurate detection methods. Developing a rapid, cost-effective, and non-invasive screening tool could substantially enhance glioblastoma diagnosis, enabling earlier detection, more precise tumor margin identification, and improved differentiation from treatment-related changes. Consequently, a molecule-specific non-invasive tool that can provide comprehensive diagnostic information is essential to address these clinical challenges and improve patient outcomes. Using Surface Enhanced Raman spectroscopy (Glio-SERS) and machine learning to classify exosomes resulted in high specificity and sensitivity in glioblastoma identification. Importantly, Glio-SERS is capable of differentiating between glioblastoma and other brain lesions with high accuracy. Consequently, Glio-SERS has the potential to drastically improve glioblastoma detection and transform the brain cancer field by providing a rapid, sensitive, and non-invasive diagnostic for glioblastoma patients.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a predictive biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence post-treatment that provides key spatial distribution information about cell interaction. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common form of liver cancer and has poor five-year survival rates of below 20%. Early-stage HCC patients often undergo surgery to remove damaged livers as a means of disease intervention. However, the effectiveness of surgery is often counteracted by high recurrence rates, which can range from 50-70%. To reduce high recurrence, adjuvant therapies can be used in the clinic, yet these therapies cause severe adverse events in more than a third of the patients. One of the primary challenges of combating early recurrence is identifying reliable biomarkers to help predict patients who are most likely to experience HCC recurrence after treatments like surgery or chemoembolization. Prior biomarkers for HCC, such as gene signatures or protein expression, are limited in their ability to provide information about the spatial distribution of cells or how cancer and immune cells interact with each other. To address this gap Stanford researchers developed a novel spatial signature/ biomarker capable of identifying patients at high risk of recurrence with high accuracy. This predictive capability could enhance patient outcomes by making more informed selection of patients for risky adjuvant therapies, as well as enabling more tailored post-operative treatment plans. The technology is also designed to work with standard histology samples, making it easily integrable into current clinical and commercial workflows without the need for specialized equipment or processes.",

    "ip_description": "Typically, cell live imaging and cell molecular profiling are performed on two different samples without the direct observation of two modalities of information on the exact same cells. The main challenge lies in tissue distortions and loss of spatial information during sample processing, such as slicing or chemical treatments. Stanford researchers have developed a solution to track the spatial coordinates of the sample throughout the process. By maintaining a coordinated reference system and correcting for distortions, the method allows researchers to map molecular profiles back to the same cells that were observed in vivo. This approach offers a new level of precision in studying organs like the brain, liver, or kidney, where understanding both cellular function and molecular properties is critical. Applications: Aligning of in vivo cell imaging and ex vivo structural molecular profiling of the same cells, Research in: Neuroscience, cancer, clinical diagnostics, drug development, immunotherapy.

    "ip_description": "Among the many medical imaging modalities, CT and MRI scans are utilized most often for imaging bone and soft tissue respectively. As such, physicians often require both images to fully diagnose patients and determine treatment plans. To better harness these advantages, this work has developed a deep-learning model for creating hybrid CT-MRI images from highly sparse sensory data. The key component of this technology utilizes the assumption that each hybrid, CT, and MRI image can be reconstructed from a shared latent feature space. Therefore, the training set only requires a mini-batch of CT and MRI images each which is fed into the cross-modal auto encoder framework. Preliminary testing has shown that analytic reconstruction of just the CT or MRI images show large streak artifacts due to under-sampled data, but the hybrid image has high similarity with the true images. The degree of fusion between CT and MRI can also be tuned using a fusion hyperparameter allowing physicians to create the most useful image.\n\nApplications:\n- Treatment planning for radiation therapy\n- Hybrid image guided interventions (e.g., radiation therapy or surgery)\n- Effectively fuse different modality images: low-dose CT and fast MRI reconstruction\n\nAdvantages:\n- Higher image quality for improved diagnostics and image guidance: hybrid images preserve high bone contrast and clear soft tissue dynamic range\n- Creation of MRI image from CT sensory data, and vice versa.\n- Reduced human intervention in regularization term design",

Opioids are a powerful tool for pain management when used in clinical care settings. However, in recent years these drugs have been misappropriated for recreational use, spurring a public health crisis. In the US alone there were over 80,000 deaths due to opioid overdose in 2022. Naloxone has proven to be a key tool in the fight against opioid overdose by acting as an agonist of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). However, use of naloxone for opioid overdose has drawbacks, including that naloxone requires larger, repeated doses in response to more potent fentanyl. To this end, a need exists for novel negative allosteric modulators of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) that are selective with limited off target effects.\n\nStage of Development\nResearch - in vitro\n\nStage of Research\nResearchers sought to improve upon their previous finding (compound 368) via structure-based optimization in order to find compounds with enhanced medicinal chemistry properties. Specifically, researchers modified a potentially labile sulfide to an ether to improve its pharmacokinetic properties. Researchers found that this compound is an allosteric modulator of the MOR in vitro. While this molecule is still a full inhibitor of the MOR, it has a dampened ability to enhance naloxone affinity for the receptor, which in turn makes the molecule less dependent on co-administration with naloxone for activity.\n\nApplications\n\n* Novel treatment of opioid overdose\n\nAdvantages\n\n* Potentially less dependent on co-administration with naloxone for therapeutic effects",

H5 avian influenza strains are among the most concerning despite lack of documented human to human transmission due to their high mortality rates (40-60%). Currently available vaccines are unlikely to confer significant immunity to H5. Additionally, a large portion of public health resources every year are expended to create a seasonal vaccine for influenza viral strains that are circulating in the general population. Taken together, these facts point towards the urgent unmet need for a universal influenza vaccine. The inventors have created novel vaccine candidates for H5 influenza viruses. Specifically, the immune response to these vaccine candidates is directed towards specific epitopes that are conserved across strains and are less mutable than epitopes that are traditionally exposed. A modified H5 HA antigen is presented in a defined orientation via electrostatic interactions with the adjuvant such that specific epitopes are exposed and the immune response is therefore directed towards those exposed epitopes. This in turn will confer immunity to a larger breadth of viral variants. Experiments in mice with these vaccine candidates have shown that these vaccine candidates generate broad immunity to a number of influenza strains. Applications: Vaccine candidates for H5 avian influenza, Vaccine candidates for a breadth of influenza viruses. Advantages: Generates broad immunity to a number of influenza viral strains via exposure of a conserved epitope.",

The immune system is an integral part of the human body's response to outside threats, including cancer. Specifically, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells have been shown to selectively seek and eliminate cancer cells. However, cancer cells have evolved several ways to evade this immune response, including downregulating receptors, altering tumor associated antigens, and changing the tumor microenvironment. High throughput genetic knockdown and knockout screens have been highly effective in identifying key genetic drivers of these mechanisms. However, these screens are most likely to identify factors that are necessary but not sufficient for a response. A need exists for new methods in identifying and isolating novel regulators of the cancer immune interface. The inventors have developed a method by which cancer cells are able to be specifically sensitized to enhance their elimination by cytotoxic lymphocytes. Specifically, the inventors performed a screen to identify factors which make cancer cells more susceptible to killing by CD8+ T cells. These targets were then overexpressed, individually or in combination, in cancer cells in order to sensitize them to cytotoxic lymphocyte killing. Targets for this sensitization also include ligands that can act in a paracrine signalling mechanism to induce cytotoxic killing activity in engineered lymphocytes. Taken together, this invention comprises a promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment and prevention of cancer. Applications include production of sensitized cancer cells and engineered cytotoxic lymphocytes, and a novel therapeutic avenue for the treatment and/or prevention of cancer.

Available therapies for osteoporosis-related bone loss are effective but come with significant side effects. As such, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects profiles. In a separate vein, stem cell technologies represent a new frontier in modern medicine. Indeed, human skeletal stem cell (hSSC) dysfunction has been implicated in musculoskeletal diseases, specifically in the context of aging. There remains a major unmet medical need for therapies targeting the re-activation of dysfunctional hSSCs in the context of musculoskeletal diseases. The inventors have pioneered a novel method for re-activating dysfunctional hSSCs in the context of disease or age related dysfunction. These researchers found that aged SSCs have lower bone-forming potential due to their lack of diversity via their skewed lineage trajectory towards fibrostromal tissues. Using a Boolean mathematics approach, they identified two factors that can re-instate youthful SSC activity in dysfunctional diseased or aged SSCs. Specifically, this method involves contacting stem cells with a combination of an inhibitor of bone morphogenic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B) and an activator of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling. Indeed, co-administration of such factors was shown to increase osteogenesis in mice. Applications include regeneration of bone due to aging and or disease.

The D-Lab chip-size spin processor efficiently generates one-handed circular polarized light regardless of excitation sources (e.g. light or electrical excitation), and detects both the circular polarization state and intensity of an incoming light at the same time. The integrated nanophotonic platform (figure 1) includes a high-quality-factor (high-Q) chiral Si metasurface integrated with a light-emitting or absorbing thin-film. The high-Q chiral metasurface is made of periodically arranged silicon 'meta-atoms' with a subwavelength thickness (i.e. 220 nm), Q over 2400, and a nearly 100-fold near-field electric field enhancement for one-handed circularly polarized light over the other. To demonstrate the photon spin processor for classical and quantum light sources, the D-Lab integrated the Si metasurface with a monolayer crystal MoSe2, transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) film. The resulting processor, free of bulky birefringent crystals, can generate valley-selective emission at room temperature with a user-defined chirality. Importantly, the light emitter can be photoexcited or electrically excited. Compact chiral light generation for both classical and quantum systems can greatly improve multiplexing of data streams, increase speeds, lower latency, and increase data volume. Stage of Development \u2013 Proof of Concept Prototype. Ongoing development includes expanding the number of spin processor pixels per chip, integrating the spin processor chip with an electrical circuit board, and packaging a prototype electro-optic device.

Ultracompact classical chiral light sources and 2D sensors for: Chiral sensing and circular dichroism spectroscopy, Enantiomers separation crucial to pharmaceuticals development and manufacturing, Photodynamic therapy and optogenetics. Optics-free chiral light detector to simultaneously measure circular polarization state and intensity (without birefringent crystals or photodiodes). Advantages: High performance: Multiplexing capability - A single chip (1 cm2) can encompass over 4000 processors (or pixels) with uniform or different functionalities, High spin selectivity - Integrated with a light-emitting or absorbing thin film, the metasurface reaches nearly 100% selectivity of one-handed circular polarization over the other, High spectral resolution. CMOS compatible fabrication. Highly compatible with transparent conducting films (e.g. indium tin oxide and graphene).

Understanding the cancer processes that influence atherosclerosis is crucial for developing therapies to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disorders in cancer patients and survivors.

By comparing mRNA expression levels in the aortic arches of mice with and without tumors, they found that this gene is upregulated in the presence of tumors. The tumor-promoted upregulation was also confirmed in cultured human aortic endothelial cells. The increased expression of this gene triggers angiogenesis and intraplaque neovessel formation, contributing to heightened atherogenesis and plaque vulnerability. An effective dose of an agent that inhibits this gene could stabilize, prevent, or reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation in cancer patients.

Created via precise stacking or 'relative twist' of van der Waals (vdW) layers, moir\u00e9 superlattices exhibit unpredicted and unexpected emergent electronics states, including superconductivity, making them attractive for a wide range of applications such as quantum devices, sensors, superconductors, ferroelectric memory, spintronic devices, and metamaterials. The most common preparation method (tear-and-stack of Scotch tape exfoliated monolayers) is inefficient, unreproducible, and suffers twist angle inhomogeneity, interfacial contamination, micrometer sizes, and a tendency to untwist at elevated temperatures. The Fang Liu Group fabrication method (see Figure 1) produces moir\u00e9 superlattices from a wide range of 2D materials with unprecedented uniformity and versatility, achieving much higher throughput and near-unity yield over centimeter-scale macroscopic areas, representing a significant improvement compared to conventional techniques. The target twist angle in homo twisted moir\u00e9 structures can be precisely controlled (either manually or through automated processes), due to the perfect lattice alignment of the exfoliated monolayer within the original van der Waals layered crystal. Furthermore, the macroscopic dimension enhances thermal stability of the small twist angle structures, preventing untwisting under high-temperature processes that are essential for device fabrications.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have discovered that treating colonized kidney stones with a cationic biopolymer effectively disrupts bacterial biofilms and reduces bacterial burden while remaining biocompatible with kidney tissue. Irrigating the kidney with this cationic biopolymer during surgery could serve as a novel method to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and sepsis in kidney stone procedures. Kidney stones are an increasingly prevalent urological disorder, often causing significant pain and requiring surgical intervention. Pathogenic bacteria are present in up to 40% of stones and can form biofilms which protect them from antibiotic treatments. As a result, stone surgeries can inadvertently disperse bacterial biofilms across the urinary tract and cause up to 30% of patients to develop a UTI and 15% to develop sepsis. Despite these known complications, little effort has been made to address this clinical issue. The standard clinical practice involves urine tests for infection followed by antibiotic treatment if the culture is positive. However, urine culture positivity rates are low compared to pelvic and stone culture positivity rates and intravenous antimicrobial therapies do not lower the risk of postoperative UTIs. Therefore, a new method of UTI and sepsis prevention during kidney stone procedures is needed. A cationic biopolymer has been demonstrated to interact with negatively charged bacterial surfaces, disrupting their membranes and inducing cell death through the leakage of intracellular components. Furthermore, the biopolymer disrupts bacterial biofilms, thereby reducing their resilience to antibiotic treatments. And, in the urinary tract, the biopolymer interacts with the urothelium, inducing exfoliation that expels and facilitates the eradication of highly resistant intracellular bacterial reservoirs. Treatment of colonized patient kidney stones with the biopolymer resulted in a greater than 90% bacterial viability decrease after 90 minutes. Importantly, histological analysis of human urothelium did not show any abnormalities or cytotoxic effects after treatment with the biopolymer. Therefore, the inclusion of this cationic biopolymer in saline irrigation methods during kidney surgeries can be an impactful preventative measure to decrease UTIs and sepsis in kidney stone patients.",

Therefore, the use of PTER inhibitors may be an effective way of treating obesity and other metabolic disorders.\n\nN-acetyltaurine is an abundant endogenous metabolite whose levels are dynamically regulated by diverse physiologic perturbations that increase taurine and/or acetate flux, including endurance exercise, alcohol consumption, and nutritional taurine supplementation. Interestingly, taurine supplementation has been reported to reduce mitochondrial redox stress, enhance exercise performance, and suppress body weight. PTER, an orphan body mass index-associated enzyme, was shown to have N-acetyltransferase/hydrolase activity and be capable of converting taurine to N-acetyltaurine. Genetic ablation of PTER and/or pharmacological administration of N-acetyltaurine in mice resulted in suppressed body weight and adiposity.\n\nIterative screening for and optimization of PTER inhibitors resulted in the discovery of small molecule inhibitors with a > 250-fold selectivity for PTER.

CRISPR/Cas9 systems have gained momentum in the past decade as a fast, cheap and relatively targeted approach to genome editing. Adeno-associated viral vectors are commonly used to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 due to their efficiency, safety, lower immunogenicity and non-integrative features (i.e. AAV does not integrate into the host genome reducing the likelihood of Cas9 off-target effects). Despite these benefits, one of AAV's shortcomings is its relatively low packaging capacity of 4.7 kb which makes AAV's difficult to use for larger/bulkier cargo. To overcome this packaging limitation, Stanford researchers developed a delivery construct that increases the packaging capacity of recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors. The improvement creates new therapeutic delivery avenues for genetic diseases that have previously fallen outside of the packaging limitation of AAV's such as hemophilia A, cystic fibrosis, duchenne muscular dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt Disease, Usher Syndrome 1B, Miyoshi myopathy and more. The advancement also creates opportunities for current CRISPR-based technologies to incorporate the method to improve existing delivery mechanisms. Applications: Genetic editing of larger genes for gene therapy, Cell engineering in research & industrial applications (i.e. generating cell lines that require the integration of large DNA sequences).

Current automotive sensors, such as phased arrays and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, struggle with high cost, limited field-of-view (FoV), and slow refresh rates, which can degrade performance in dynamic driving environments. This technology addresses these limitations by utilizing a plastic Fresnel lens combined with a 65 nm CMOS imaging array to achieve high angular resolution. The system operates at 220 GHz, offering 0.78\u00b0 angular resolution and 3 m range resolution. This approach simplifies the receiver architecture and eliminates additional latency, providing a cost-effective and efficient solution. Potential applications include advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles, where high-resolution imaging is critical for object detection in various weather conditions.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed Miro1 Reducer, a small molecule that targets the mitochondrial protein Miro1 to treat Glioblastoma, addressing the root cause of tumor growth and immune resistance, and demonstrating significant efficacy in reducing tumor size and improving survival in preclinical models. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, with an alarming annual incidence of about 16,000 cases and poor survival rate. Current treatment modalities, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and even cutting-edge immunotherapies, have failed to provide substantial improvements in patient outcomes. Despite the therapeutic promise shown by immunotherapies in rodent models, their translation to human patients has faced significant hurdles. Moreover, existing treatments often target the immune cells themselves but fail to address the core mechanisms driving GBM proliferation and resistance. There is an urgent need for improved or alternative treatments that target the root cause of GBM. To address this need, Stanford researchers have developed Miro1 Reducer, a small molecule targeting a mitochondrial protein to treat GBM. Mitochondria are crucial for cellular homeostasis and the tumor microenvironment, supporting tumor growth and evasion. Cancerous and adjacent immune cells exhibit metabolic changes including the transfer of mitochondria from non-cancerous to cancer cells, facilitating tumor proliferation. Miro1 Reducer addresses this by targeting the mitochondrial protein Miro1, which is key in these processes. By reducing Miro1 expression in GBM cells, this small molecule hinders metabolic adaptations and immune evasion strategies. In a pilot study, Miro1 Reducer has shown remarkable efficacy in the rescue of tumor size and improving survival in GBM mouse models potentially by suppressing mitochondrial DNA-dependent immune activation, preventing mitochondrial transfer, and promoting mitophagy. In summary, Miro1 Reducer offers a novel mitochondrial-targeted therapy for GBM, effectively reducing tumor size and improving survival in GBM mouse models. Applications: Oral drug that Glioblastoma patients can take to prevent tumor growth and improve prognosis, Targeted therapeutics and personalized treatment for Glioblastoma, Potential for treating Parkinson's disease and Friedreich Ataxia. Advantages: Currently, no effective treatments exist on the market for Glioblastoma, Miro1 Reducer addresses the root cause of immune resistance and tumor proliferation by targeting the mitochondria, unlike existing methods, which primarily target immune cells.",

The current state-of-art leverages electron multiplied or qCMOS cameras with millions of pixels and kHz of bandwidth, limiting the ability to simultaneously time- and space- resolve low light dynamics. The Stanford invention serializes (in time) light from many input spatial modes (pixels) into a common output (either a single output mode or multiple), where it can be detected on a single-pixel, ultra high speed ultra low noise photosensor.

Targeting these epitopes for vaccine development could lead to effective vaccines for TB. TB is a significant global health problem that has been worsening in recent years with 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Despite the high mortality caused by TB, many individuals that test positive for TB have no symptoms and do not spread the bacteria to others. These patients have a latent TB infection and their immune system were able to successfully control the TB infection. Additionally, some patients have had significant exposure to TB and are not only asymptomatic but also test negative for a TB infection. This suggests that these individuals remain uninfected or rapidly clear their infection early on following exposure. The adaptive immune systems of these patients have likely targeted a TB epitope which is highly effective and ideal antigen candidates for vaccine design. A TB epitope that is recognized by CD4 T cells in patients that are naturally resistant to TB has been identified. Importantly, an improved antigen discovery library is expected to identify additional targets which could be highly relevant for TB vaccine design. Stage of Development: Research: in vitro Continued research: in vitro validations of the T cell phenotype that recognizes the TB epitope; screening for additional TB epitopes.

By repurposing FDA-approved drugs, this novel approach offers a practical and timely intervention for treating Alzheimer's and related tauopathies. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global health crisis, marked by the buildup of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) primarily composed of tau protein. A critical factor in AD progression is the propagation of tau protein, which drives the spread of disease pathology throughout the brain, leading to neuronal damage and accelerated cognitive decline. Current therapeutic approaches mainly target amyloid plaques, another hallmark of AD, but have shown limited success. This has resulted in a significant gap in effective treatments that can halt or reverse the progression of AD, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic strategies. The propagation of tau protein presents an untapped opportunity for developing novel interventions. Our invention addresses this unmet need by targeting tau protein propagation, offering a novel and previously unexplored therapeutic pathway. Stanford researchers have delved into the mechanisms underlying tau propagation and identified specific sequences responsible for this activity. Leveraging this knowledge has enabled the screening of a range of bio-reagents, which identified candidates capable of inhibiting tau propagation. Several of these bio-reagents are FDA-approved drugs, which opens the door to drug repurposing, a strategy that can significantly expedite the development and approval process. In summary, this invention marks a significant advancement in AD treatment by introducing a novel approach that directly targets tau propagation using FDA-approved drugs, thereby offering a practical and timely intervention for treating Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have developed a method to detect reactivated human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) in T cell therapies using genomics technologies, including single-cell sequencing. Detecting lytic herpesvirus 6 in T cell therapies can identify patients at risk of encephalitis and assist in ensuring the safety of T cell products. Cell therapies have yielded durable clinical benefits for patients with cancer but have been accompanied by unexpected side effects. For instance, approximately 1 in 40-100 patients who undergo CAR T cell therapy suffer from HHV-6 encephalitis. Unexpectedly, the source of the lytic HHV-6 virus can come from the cell therapy itself. Therefore, the detection of lytic HHV-6 in T cell therapies can serve as a diagnostic tool to identify patients at risk of encephalitis and as a safety screening method for T cell products. Using single-cell sequencing, a rare polyclonal population of HHV-6 'super-expressors' (~1 in 360-10,000 cells) that possess high viral transcription and lytic activity late in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell culture were identified in vitro. Further, through the reanalysis of single-cell sequencing data from FDA-approved cell therapy products, the presence of CAR+, HHV-6+ super-expressor T cells were detected in vivo. Together, this implicates the T cell therapy as a potential source of lytic HHV-6 reported in multiple clinical trials and has broad implications for the design, screening, and diagnosis of unexpected toxicities in cell therapies. Applications: Identification of patients likely to develop HHV-6 encephalitis who receive T cell therapies, Safety screening autologous and allogenic CAR T cells for HHV6 virus in vitro for HHV-6 via genomics technologies, Screening of patient samples to detect HHV6 in cells, including the cell therapies, in vivo. Advantages: In cell therapies, there is no standard / routine screening for HHV-6, so this represents a significant conceptual advance, Utilizes standard / widely-available tools (experimental and computational) to identify HHV6 expression in cells, Uses easily-adoptable molecular biology reagents (including genomics tools) and informatics pipelines with custom downstream analyses to confidently call HHV6 expression.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have found that recombinant osteopontin (SPP1) protein reduces foreign body response (FBR) and thereby facilitates successful integration and function of implantable devices. FBR is an immune response in which detected foreign material is encapsulated in dense fibrotic scar tissue. While this response is crucial for protecting the body from bioactive foreign substances, it can be a problem when implants are intentionally placed in the body for treatment. FBR against these implants can lead to complications such as malfunction, infection, soft tissue disfigurement, and pain. Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) has been used as a coating on implants to effectively attenuate FBR, despite an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Given that ADM is expensive and not easily scalable, it is important to identify alternatives by uncovering its mechanisms of action. Stanford researchers have discovered that SPP1, upregulated by ADM, is necessary and sufficient for FBR attenuation. When a recombinant-SPP1-loaded hydrogel was placed adjacent to an implant, the fibrotic capsule was thinner compared to the conventional FBR. Additionally, the connective tissue architecture within the fibrotic encapsulation was comparable to that derived from ADM-coated implants. Directly managing FBR's main underlying driver SPP-1 could lead to significant improvements in biocompatibility of implantable devices.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a novel approach to ultrasound imaging using the differentiable beamforming pipeline, which optimizes critical imaging parameters, significantly enhancing image quality and diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound imaging is a well-established diagnostic tool in medicine, due to its non-invasive imaging capabilities. While the performance of ultrasound imaging relies on the accuracy of the imaging parameters, these parameters are often empirically determined and remain fixed for a given imaging device. This reliance on fixed parameters can result in images of poor quality in situations where the initial assumptions fail and might not accurately reflect the underlying biological structures. This limitation hinders achieving high-quality imaging necessary for an accurate diagnosis. To address this need, Stanford researchers have developed a novel approach to ultrasound imaging using the differentiable formulation of the beamforming pipeline which adjusts parameters based on the specific imaging context. The software allows the system to learn and continuously optimize parameters during the imaging process, ensuring that the settings are always aligned with the current imaging environment. This approach differs from the static parameters used in traditional ultrasound imaging which is set for a given imaging device. Stanford researchers have demonstrated the efficacy of this technology in optimizing sound speed and element position for flexible arrays which are critical for accurate ultrasound imaging, resulting in more reliable imaging parameter estimates. By leveraging the differentiable formulation of the beamforming pipeline, our invention offers an innovative solution through optimization of imaging parameters, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy and driving the future of ultrasound imaging technology.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed AZD7648, a novel DNA-PK inhibitor that enhances HDR efficiency in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing by shifting DNA repair from the error-prone NHEJ pathway to the precise HDR pathway, significantly improving gene targeting outcomes in human cells for effective ex vivo gene therapies. Ex vivo gene therapy is a powerful approach, which involves genetically modifying human cells outside the body using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and then reintroducing them into the patient for treatment of genetic disorders and cancers. Genetic modifications using CRISPR-Cas9 occurs by creating double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in DNA, repaired by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR). HDR is more precise but less consistent across different genomic loci due to the inconsistency in the levels of HDR activity, often leading to repairs by error-prone NHEJ pathway resulting in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Though DNA-PK inhibitors have been used to improve HDR efficiency, results are inconsistent across different human cell types. There is an urgent need for innovative solutions that enhance HDR efficiency in different genomic loci and cell types. To address this need, Stanford researchers have developed AZD7648, a novel potent DNA-PK inhibitor to enhance the HDR efficiency in CRISPR-Cas9 based gene editing across different genomic loci. By inhibiting the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a key component of NHEJ repair pathway, AZD7648 shifts the DNA repair mechanism towards the HDR pathway, allowing for more precise gene modifications. Stanford researchers have demonstrated that AZD7648 treatment outperforms other DNA-PK inhibitors, achieving up to 100% targeting frequency for small nucleotide changes and 80% for large sequence integrations in multiple human primary cell types. This invention enhances HDR gene targeting efficiency and poised to significantly improve the efficacy of ex vivo gene therapies for treating various genetic diseases and cancers. Stage of Development: Research - in vitro. The next steps involve in vivo validation of the gene-edited human cells generated with the AZD7648 treatment. Future studies include safety studies using multiple cell types and genomic loci to assess commercial viability. Applications: Ex vivo gene therapy products, Treatment for various genetic diseases and cancers. Advantages: Enhanced HDR-based gene targeting efficiency, applicable in multiple human cell types, Superior potency and specificity compared to other DNA-PK inhibitors, Precision and higher gene targeting frequencies, when compared to current methods, Therapeutic relevance with ongoing clinical trials for solid tumors.",

Laser microdissection enables scientists to precisely visualize specific cells or small regions of tissue under a microscope and isolate them for downstream analysis. This is especially critical when analyzing specific cell types in heterogenous samples like tumors. However, available instruments for laser microdissection have significant drawbacks, as they are unable to reliably isolate single cells, are error-prone, and struggle with physical influences such as electrostatics. Additionally, such open systems leave samples prone to contamination and cannot reliably store samples for later analysis. Stanford researchers therefore developed an improved system combining laser microdissection with microfluidics. Cells are isolated using a laser and dispensed into buffer running through a microfluidic chip, where a system of valves sorts different samples. In contrast to systems that rely on gravity, this allows for reliable and standardized sample isolation. This also protects samples from contamination and enables their long-term storage.

The combination of AAV with CRISPR/Cas9 has proven to be a highly efficient strategy for site-specific genome editing. Typically, Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is electroporated into cells and induces a double-stranded break at a target site in the genome, while AAV delivers single-stranded DNA repair templates into the nucleus. The cell then employs endogenous DNA repair machinery to fix the Cas9-induced break using the AAV-delivered DNA as a template. This strategy has been used to make both small changes and large insertions in the genome, enabling both cures for genetic disorders as well as immune cell engineering for the treatment of cancers and autoimmune disorders. However, Stanford researchers recently discovered that a large proportion of cells (~50% or more) edited in this way contain target-site concatemeric knockins of the AAV genome. Critically, these concatemeric knockins greatly affect the level of gene expression but cannot be readily detected by commonly used assays.

In addition, the method is suitable for the synthesis of short-chain organics (less than three carbons) and inorganic small molecules. Applications include ammonia production for fertilizer, methanol production, hydrogen peroxide production, formic acid production, oxygen production, ethane production, and methane production. Advantages include low cost, less energy intensive (uses humidified air instead of H2 as the proton source for ammonia production), and eco-friendly (removes the need for toxic precursors, no carbon dioxide emissions).",

    "ip_description": "Silent speech interfaces (SSIs) offer a non-invasive alternative to brain-computer interfaces for silent verbal communication. However, available SSIs have limited accuracy. Stanford researchers have therefore developed a new multimodal algorithm for decoding silent, attempted, or imagined speech. Researchers developed a new algorithm in which many different data modalities (audio, EMG, neural microelectrode arrays, etc.) are encoded via artificial neural networks. Innovative formulations of contrastive loss functions encode each data modality into a unified latent representation. This unified approach allows for the decoding of each individual data modality with superior efficacy and represents a leap forward in the field of multimodal machine learning for speech decoding. Stage of Development: Prototype: achieves 12.2% word error rate on silent EMG and 3.7% word error rate on vocal EMG (significantly superior to state-of-the-art). Applications: Decoding and synthesis of text and audio from various speech forms, including verbalized, silent, attempted, and imagined speech; Communication devices for individuals with speech impediments and other conditions that impede speech; Consumer devices for communicating via subvocalization; New interfaces for conversational AI powered by silent speech.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have created a new strategy for collecting and integrating human microbiome, multi-omics, and immune cell activation data that reveals new insights into the roles of different bacterial strains in human health. Humans live in concert with thousands of different bacteria throughout our bodies. These bacteria help digest our food, protect us from infection, and regulate our immune system. Accordingly, alterations in the human microbiome are associated with diseases ranging from diabetes to cardiovascular disease, and therapeutics that alter the microbiome represent a promising approach to treating a wide range of disorders. However, deciphering the roles of bacterial strains in disease has remained a major challenge, due to the large number of unique bacteria that compose the microbiome and their variability from individual to individual. Researchers therefore developed an approach that integrates microbiome analysis and multi-omics to better understand the roles of different members of the microbiome. Levels of immune markers and co-culture of immune cell organoids with different commensal bacteria further inform their role in the immune system. Using this approach, researchers discovered bacterial strains that could treat high cholesterol and insulin resistance or act as vaccine adjuvants. This strategy has broad applicability in creating new therapeutics that act by altering the microbiome. Clinical data: microbiome data, multi-omics, and clinical markers collected from 86 individuals over up to 6 years. Applications: Diagnosis of disease and disease progression through a microbiome signature, Microbiome-based therapeutics, including personalized therapeutics, Discovery of bacterial strains that can act as vaccine adjuvants.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed an innovative technology for cryo-vitrification using a temperature-controlled cold gas stream instead of traditional liquid cryogen, which prevents grid distortion, enabling gentle sample cooling and continuous imaging throughout the vitrification process. Traditional cryo-vitrification methods which involve a plunge freezing or blot-less deposition or spraying liquid cryogen on cryoEM grids for vitrification encounter numerous challenges, from grid distortion and damage, imaging limitations, complex sample handling, equipment dependencies and constraints on time-resolved experiments. There is an urgent need for a solution that addresses these challenges for cryoEM sample preparation. Stanford researchers have developed a technology which addresses these issues by simplifying the vitrification process. Instead of submerging samples in liquid cryogen, this innovation uses a novel approach which exposes the sample and cryoEM grid to a temperature-controlled cold-gas stream delivered via a cryo-nozzle, which eliminates grid distortion and allows continuous imaging before, during, and after vitrification. Prior to vitrification, the gas stream is blocked to prevent premature cooling. Upon activation, the cold gas rapidly cools the sample grid, ensuring efficient vitrification. Since the sample and cryoEM grid do not move during the vitrification process and not submerged in a cryogen, the grids can be continuously imaged using an optical microscope and exposed to various triggers for time-resolved measurements during and after vitrification. Additionally, the sample-grid can safely remain in the cold gas stream for other operations and removed using a specialized cryo-tong (also part of this invention) and saved for cryoEM imaging. In summary, this innovation overcomes the limitations of traditional cryo-vitrification methods, offering a comprehensive solution for advanced sample preparation in cryoEM research. Applications: Vitrify sample grids for successful CryoEM single-particle imaging, Preparation of sample grids for other techniques that employ rapid vitrification of samples for electron microscopy applications, Mitigates some of the problems associated with available devices for sample-grid vitrification, Facilitates extra sample manipulation and probing steps for time resolved CryoEM analysis. Advantages: There is not a commercial device currently available that specializes in time-resolved cryoEM, Grid Protection due to gentle cold-gas stream, Continuous imaging throughout the vitrification process, Flexible and simplified sample handling, Streamlined sample preparation workflow, reducing complexity and costs, Eliminates the need for specialized equipment and accessible to a wider audience.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have discovered BRP3, a novel peptide derived from the BRINP3 protein, which effectively reduces food intake and body fat in mice, while preserving muscle mass, thus offering a novel, safe and effective solution to treat obesity. Obesity is a major global health concern expected to affect over 25% of the global population by 2035. It shortens life expectancy by 5-10 years and increases the risk of death from diabetes, heart disease, and other related conditions. Current weight loss methods, including caloric restriction and existing weight loss drugs, often lead to muscle mass reduction, compromising overall health and physical function. Combination therapies have been explored, but no current treatment prevents muscle loss while promoting weight loss. Effective drugs that can reverse obesity without causing significant side effects, including loss of muscle mass, remain an unmet need. To address this, Stanford researchers have discovered a novel peptide (BRP3) derived from the human BRINP3 protein that reverses obesity without causing muscle loss. BRP3 is a peptide cleaved from the parent protein BRINP3 and detected in human plasma. When administered to diet-induced obese mice, the peptide BRP3 reduced food intake within 30 minutes of a single injection, with effects lasting up to 3 hours. Subsequent studies showed that daily administration of BRP3 in diet-induced obese mice led to significant weight loss by 10% and improved glucose tolerance, with weight loss attributed to a reduction in subcutaneous and visceral fat mass, without changes in skeletal or heart muscle mass. In summary, this invention introduces BRP3, a BRINP3 peptide, which combats obesity by suppressing food intake and body fat without affecting muscle mass, showcasing its therapeutic potential as a safe and promising anti-obesity treatment.",

Currently available antibodies against NKp46 are only capable of binding a single species ortholog (e.g. only human or only murine), which has necessitated significant modifications to the antibody to enable testing in preclinical mouse models. Species cross-reactive antibodies that bind to NKp46 would make it possible to validate an unmodified antibody in preclinical models before progressing into human clinical trials.\n\nThe species cross-reactive antibodies displayed nanomolar affinity to human, murine and cyno NKp46. The antibodies enabled NK cell proliferation and expansion. Importantly, bispecific antibodies constructed with these antibodies demonstrated increased cytotoxicity of both human and mouse NK cells towards tumor cells as compared to their monospecific counterparts.

By cycling this chemistry with calcium carbonate calcination, a new carbon dioxide removal process emerges where the calcium/magnesium products capture CO2 from air as stable (bi)carbonates while process emissions are sequestered. Studies shows this could provide efficient CO2 removal using less than half the energy of leading direct air capture technologies.

Tr1 cells. Currently, we do not have means for in vivo therapeutic targeting of Tr1 cells, but Tr1 cells differentiated in vitro have a potent therapeutic potential. However, in vitro differentiated Tr1 cell therapy products, called T-allo10 cells, contain ~10% of Tr1 cells. Thus, strategies to target Tr1 cell differentiation in vivo and generate purified Tr1 cell products in vitro can provide therapeutic benefit in wide variety of human diseases. Inventors at Stanford developed a method targeting master regulator transcription factors of Tr1 cells to increase the efficacy of their differentiation and manipulate their functions. Master regulators are key transcription factors that regulate cell lineage identity, differentiation and functions. They showed that the transcription factors IRF4 and BATF are necessary for Tr1 differentiation, and that the activation of transcription factor MAF potentiates Tr1 cell differentiation. Using CRISPRa, the inventors than developed a method that allows the manipulation of Tr1 cell induction, which will enable the manipulation of endogenous or adoptively transferred Tr1 cells in vivo. The ability to genetically engineer Tr1 cells can lead to better treatments for graft-versus-host disease, rejection of solid organ transplants, severe autoimmunity and allergy.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have discovered the first of its kind gene therapy vector to treat eye diseases of the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium cells (NPCECs). With a gene therapy vector, a more predictable and stable treatment is possible to treat glaucoma and inflammatory conditions of the eyes when utilizing specific gene targets. The Mahajan Laboratory at Stanford used tissue culture in vitro to identify a minimal DNA promotor to drive gene expression in the NPCECs. The method has shown that a BEST2 minimal promoter (specific to NPCECs gene expression) can be manipulated and linked to a sequence of gene encoding of interest in the NPCECs to treat eye disease. Primarily, NPCECs are linked to glaucoma which affects 60 million people worldwide with no cure. Current management involves delaying the progression of disease, but many people continue to lose eyesight (due to retinal ganglion cell loss) permanently even with proper therapies. NPCECs are also involved in inflammatory conditions (anterior/iridocyclitis), pseudoexfoliation syndrome, and uveal melanoma. With extended research, this technology can provide a cure and improve treatment of a vast array of eye diseases that lack effective therapy.\n\n**Stage of Development**\n\n*   The gene therapy vector has been tested in vitro.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers in Dr. Mahajan's laboratory have discovered biomarkers to differentiate between infectious (endophthalmitis) and non-infectious uveitis; and, to accurately categorize the types of infectious uveitis. With these biomarkers, a more efficient and reliable approach compared to conventional methods (mainly clinical findings and gram stains/cultures) can be used to treat uveitis caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, helminths, or parasites. Instead of waiting days or weeks for laboratory results to determine microbial content, use of biomarkers to identify the etiology of uveitis is faster, more accurate, and more reliable. Particularly in ocular inflammatory cases, waiting for the correct diagnosis and treatment (50% of cases are idiopathic) can cause visual impairment, and ultimately blindness due to the recurrent and chronic nature of the disease process. Proteomic analysis was used to characterize the molecular profiles of the inflamed vitreous by taking biopsies from patients with various vitreoretinal diseases. This technique allowed researchers to identify characteristic protein signatures relating to infectious endophthalmitis and non-infectious uveitis in a mass spectrometry-based screen.\n\n**Figure Description:** Proteomic profiles differ between classes of infectious endophthalmitis: (A) Hierarchal clustering of proteins differentially expressed in our infectious endophthalmitis samples (all classes) compared to normal controls (ERM). Results are represented as a heatmap and display protein expression levels on a logarithmic scale. Orange = high expression. Dark green/black = low or no expression. A total of 89 proteins were upregulated and a total of 88 proteins were downregulated (p 0.05). (B) Protein signatures were categorized by infection class (bacterial, viral, and fungal) and further analyzed by comparative Venn diagram analysis.\n\n**Stage of Development:** Protein biomarkers are now being validated in a custom multiplex ELISA array.\n\n**Applications:**\n- Diagnosis of the etiology of infectious uveitis whether it is due to bacteria, viruses, fungi, helminths, or parasites so treatment can be expedited\n- Infectious endophthalmitis and non-infectious uveitis\n\n**Advantages:**\n- **Fast results** \u2013 Do not have to wait days to weeks for laboratory culture.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed an innovative AI-driven solution for predicting immunotherapy response in esophagogastric cancer patients. By leveraging deep learning models and single-cell analysis, this method identifies robust biomarkers associated with treatment outcomes. Esophagogastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, posing a significant health concern. While immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is the standard of care and has shown remarkable efficacy, its benefits vary widely among patients. Many patients fail to experience benefits from these expensive treatments, highlighting the urgent need for reliable predictive biomarkers. Existing biomarker tests like PD-L1 immunohistochemistry suffer from inaccuracies and high variability, leaving patients to endure ineffective treatments, toxic side effects, and financial strain. This discrepancy underscores a critical challenge and highlights a urgent need for reliable biomarkers for predicting immunotherapy treatment response. To address this problem, Stanford researchers have developed an innovative AI-driven solution for predicting immunotherapy response in esophagogastric cancer patients. By conducting single-cell analysis of standard histopathology images from immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated patients, this methodology accurately forecasts treatment outcomes. By leveraging deep learning models and fully automated cell annotation, this approach provides a comprehensive analysis of the tumor microenvironment, including cell density, composition, and spatial interactions, thereby identifying robust biomarkers associated with treatment outcomes. In a study of 82 advanced esophagogastric cancer patients, this approach demonstrated significant predictive power, highlighting its potential for personalized cancer treatment. In summary, this innovation represents a transformative leap in immunotherapy selection, offering personalized treatments for patients suffering from cancer. Applications include discovery of reliable biomarkers for predicting patient response to immunotherapy, selecting the right patients that will benefit from specific immunotherapies, guiding immunotherapy treatment decisions for clinicians and improving patient outcomes, significant cost effectiveness from selecting the right patients for immunotherapy, optimization of patient selection in clinical trials, biomarker-directed treatment strategies, improving cancer survival outcomes by avoiding ineffective and toxic therapies, and companion diagnostics in cancer immunotherapy. Advantages include significantly improving upon existing immunotherapy predictive biomarkers, utilizing standard diagnostic histopathology slides for increased accessibility and cost-effectiveness, single-cell spatial analysis approach providing high-resolution biologically interpretable insights into the tumor microenvironment at the cellular level using H&E slides, computational approach providing deeper insights into tumor microenvironment, avoiding overfitting and generalizable, unlike existing black box models, mitigating ineffective treatments and reducing toxicity risks, and alleviating financial burdens for immunotherapy treated patients.",

The ability to genetically engineer cells, whether in vivo or ex vivo, has emerged as a promising treatment approach for a wide range of conditions, including cancers and anemias. However, despite their therapeutic potential, extending these engineering techniques to a broader spectrum of diseases has been challenging due to limitations in targeting hard-to-reach tissues and delivering larger segments of genetic material. This has hindered the widespread adoption of cell engineering as a standard treatment modality. Now, Professor Hiromitsu's group has developed a solution that can overcome these issues. Their platform called Secreted Particle Information Transfer (SPIT), allows the engineering of genetic information in vivo with the use of a novel delivery vesicle, opening up a wider range of potential use cases for cell engineering. Applications: Cell engineering in vivo: Altering genotypes, Altering epigenetic state, Reduction of aging, Delivery of genetic information (e.g. mRNA vaccine).

However, these techniques are incapable of simultaneous engineering of protein-protein pairs through library-on-library selections. An efficient synthetic system for bidirectional, simultaneous protein-protein coevolution could serve as a platform to simulate natural coevolution and for biotechnology applications. The Garcia Lab at Stanford has invented a unique protein engineering platform to co-evolve protein-protein pairs using combinatorial biology approaches. The method adopts Z domain-affibody pairs as a model system to generate co-evolved interfaces that were extensively characterized by 10 X-ray crystal structures, next-generation sequencing (NGS), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and bioinformatics. The approach enabled efficient isolation of completely re-wired interfaces with a wide range of affinities and orthogonalities. Deep sequencing enabled the inventors to reconstruct evolutionary pathways of protein pairs and they have since sequenced thousands of protein-protein complexes with different degrees of specificity, cross-reactivity and orthogonality. These sequences could find applications in many types of synthetic biology methods. The integration of a synthetic coevolution platform with machine learning enables the interrogation of a protein-protein interaction with exceptional granularity.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed force sensors that can operate on very small physical scales without the need for an external connection or power supply. Mechanical forces regulate many important biological processes from stem cell differentiation to digestion. Tracking these forces and measuring pressures in an in-vivo or in-vitro microenvironment could help identify the cause of high blood pressure or other health anomalies. However, taking such measurements can be an invasive process, including the need for connective devices with wires and other conduits. The passage of such wires into an organism can create opportunities for infection and they often need to be removed once the measurements are complete. Thus, there is a need in the art for improved force and/or pressure measurement sensors that can operate without the need for an external connection or power supply. The inventors have developed force measurement devices that can operate without an external connection or power supply using a force sensor that entails upconverting nanoparticles in a host structure. The force sensors are positioned within an organism at locations where a force or pressure is applied, and the force sensors provide an output that can be used to measure and track forces applied by the organism. Applications include uncovering novel biomarkers of disease that go undetected with traditional chemical, optical and electrical sensing modalities, measuring force between an immune cell and an antigen presenting cell, and diagnostics or determining treatment efficacy. Advantages include overcoming disadvantages of other existing mechanosensing tools such as atomic force microscopy or traction force microscopy which are too large and invasive to operate in-vivo, or FRET which is limited in dynamic range and the propensity to rapidly photobleach. The sensors are small (e.g. less than 20 nm), relatively non-toxic, photostable, and exhibit a strong anti-Stokes shift that allows the force sensors to be excited in the near-IR biological window.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed methods for preparing chromatin from cells for downstream genomic chromatin mapping. Chromatin profiling strategies are widely used to map the genomic location of chromatin elements, such as histone post-translational modification and chromatin associated proteins. Though there are various different techniques to perform this profiling, they each tend to suffer from the same drawbacks, which limit their utility under certain conditions. For instance, some assays include incubating permeabilized cells with enzymes, where the nuclear envelope retains the chromatin structure and interacting biomolecules. However, this precludes anucleated cells, such as bacteria, or in cells undergoing cell division. In addition, substantial wash and centrifugation steps can introduce unwanted variability and produce negative impacts on chromatin quality that can hamper downstream analysis. Therefore, there is a need in the art for improved methods for sample preparation for chromatin mapping with lower starting material, minimal handling steps, and a non-reliance on the nuclear membrane. The inventors have developed a single vessel (i.e. a \"one-pot\") method for preparing samples for genome wide mapping of protein-DNA interactions. Compatible workflows can include DiMeLo-seq, or other methods such as CUT&RUN or CUT&TAG. In this method, wash steps have been replaced with a series of dilution and/or precipitation steps that enable addition of components that would otherwise interfere with downstream workflow steps above a certain concentration. Applications include determining the genomic location of at least one biomolecule-genomic DNA interaction, sample preparation with DiMeLo-seq, and chromatin profiling approaching using tethered enzymes such as CUT&RUN. Advantages of the technology include the one-pot or single vessel method drastically shortening the overall time and workload, lower sample requirements, minimized handling steps, allowing chromatin preparation in the absence of a nuclear envelope, and providing reliable performance in downstream profiling techniques.",

Due to their desirable band gaps and high absorption coefficient, TMDs are promising for next generation, high specific power solar cells. Current TMD fabrication methods rely on exfoliating small flakes from a bulk TMD crystal, which does not produce full, mass production friendly, multi-layer films. The Pop Lab deposited wafer-scale, multilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) films by selenizing pre-deposited, pre-patterned tungsten with solid source selenium and H2Se precursors (See Fig. 1). These WSe2 films yield a charge carrier lifetime of up to 144 ns, corresponding to power conversion efficiency of ~22% and specific power of ~64 W g-1 in a packaged solar cell, and ~3 W g-1 in a fully packaged solar module. Initial focus was WSe2, but the method could be applied to sulfur (instead of selenium), and other transition metals or even other transition metal oxides (e.g. WSe2, WS2, MoSe2, MoS2). This breakthrough could pave the way for mass-production of low cost, high-efficiency, lightweight, flexible, multilayer WSe2 (and other TMD) solar cells that are capable of irregular shapes like a drone wing, car roof, or wearable devices. Alternatively, layered TMDs could be used as contact layers for CdTe and CIGS solar cells. Applications include ultra-thin, high-specific-power, transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) solar cells for drones, low-earth-orbit satellites, electric vehicles, and wearable electronics, as well as contact layers for CdTe and CIGS solar cells. Advantages include multilayer, uniform, full coverage, large-area TMD films as required for high performance solar cells, mass-production friendly film quality, stability, reliability, scalability, and low cost, and ultra-thin, lightweight, flexible, with high absorption \u2013 compared to other solar materials, TMDs absorb ultra-high levels of sunlight.",

Available protein-based enzyme replacement therapies are not curative, require frequent infusions, and often become less effective over time. Similarly, emerging strategies that use a viral vector to deliver a functional copy of the defective gene to the liver are limited by pre-existing neutralizing antibodies, potentially life-threatening immune responses, and a decline in enzyme production over time. Researchers therefore developed a new strategy in which red blood cells are turned into enzyme-producing factories, taking advantage of the fact that red blood cells are produced in large numbers and circulate throughout the body. To achieve red blood cell specific gene expression, researchers use _ex vivo_ CRISPR/Cas editing of hematopoietic stem cells to insert a functional copy of the enzyme behind a promoter (HBA1 or HBA2) that is only active in red blood cells. Scientists further optimized this strategy for the treatment of hemophilia B, caused by mutations in factor IX. They increased the amount of factor IX secreted into the bloodstream by over 3-fold and engineered the protein to be 3.3-fold more active. Stage of development: Animal data: treatment of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency and hemophilia B in mice. Applications: Treatment of intracellular enzyme deficiencies, _e.g._ phenylketonuria; Treatment of extracellular enzyme deficiencies, _e.g._ hemophilia A and B. Advantages: One-time cure; Redundancy of HBA1 and HBA2 means that red blood cell function is not affected; Red blood cell specific gene expression prevents effects on other blood cell function; Approach is agnostic to specific genetic mutations; Minimal risk of insertional mutagenesis; Avoids immune response associated with _in vivo_ therapies; Effective even at low levels of engraftment, allowing for minimally toxic conditioning; Improved factor IX secretion (3-fold); Improved factor IX activity (3.3-fold over Padua variant currently used in clinical trials).",

MAPs are an innovative transdermal drug delivery system that allows for relatively painless, efficient, and controlled administration of medications through the skin. They are composed of an adhesive backing and an array of drug-eluting microneedles. Additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, is emerging as the preferred fabrication method for MAPs because it offers more design options and capabilities compared to the conventional silicon microfabrication method. However, the materials currently used to 3D print MAPs have limited printing resolution, are often too soft for complete insertion into the skin, and lose biocompatibility with wear. To overcome these limitations, Stanford researchers used a pyrolytic polymer to manufacture MAPs. They 3D printed the desired micro-array structure using a soft pyrolytic polymer. The printed structure was then subjected to pyrolysis, a thermal decomposition process, to form a miniaturized replica made of hard monolithic carbon. These steps ensured both high-resolution structural details and enhanced mechanical strength and stability, facilitating skin insertion and drug release. Additionally, high electrical conductivity of these MAPs enabled their use in electrochemical sensing.",

Timothy Syndrome is a severe developmental disorder that causes long QT syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, syndactyly and immune dysfunction. While scientists have discovered the genetic basis for the disorder in many patients (mutations in exon 8A of the calcium channel CACNA1C), there are no available treatments that act on this root cause. Researchers therefore developed a treatment strategy to modulate the splicing of CACNA1C. Using human cortical spheroids derived from patient cells, they screened a series of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to identify one that biases pre-mRNA splicing to include the healthy exon 8 instead of the mutated exon 8A. Scientists showed that this candidate could restore calcium defects in patient-derived cortical neurons, influence interneuron migration, and restore activity-dependent dendritic retraction in transplanted cortical organoids. This ASO therefore has significant promise for the treatment of Timothy syndrome. Stage of Development: In vitro: selectively causes mutagenic exon 8A exclusion in patient-derived cortical organoids, restores calcium defects in patient-derived cortical neurons, influences interneuron migration, restores activity-dependent dendritic retraction in transplanted cortical organoids.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have engineered chimeric cytokine receptors that are expressed in therapeutic cells to enhance their activity and therapeutic potential. To prevent toxicity from hyperactivity, the activation state of these receptors can be regulated by a drug that acts on proteases. While chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy effectively treats liquid cancers, further improvements in persistence and potency are needed to combat solid cancers clinically. Regulating cytokine-triggered intracellular signaling cascades related to growth and proliferation could help augment CAR-T cell activity, enhancing anti-tumor efficacy. To achieve this, Stanford researchers developed chimeric cytokine receptor (CCR) systems capable of constitutive signaling in the absence of their cognate cytokines. Their CCR system is comprised of two subunits, each including a heterologous dimerization domain and a cytokine receptor intracellular signaling domain (ICD). Because a cognate for the first dimerization domain is selected as the second dimerization domain and the two domains are in proximity, therapeutic cells with these CCRs have active intracellular signaling associated with persistence and potency downstream. The signaling cascade can be interrupted by regulating protease activity on ICDs to avoid exceeding the therapeutic window and causing toxicity. Cells with these CCRs could demonstrate sufficient anti-tumor activity to fight solid tumors. Applications include immunotherapy for cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and more, such as CAR-T therapy, TCR therapy, and CAR NK cell therapy. Advantages include a wide dynamic range of control, safety with no leaky activity in the off state, utilization of an FDA-approved small molecule to regulate cytokine signaling, compatibility with autologous, allogeneic or stem cell-derived therapeutic cells, inclusion of cysteine residues in the extracellular domain to stabilize the CCRs via disulfide bonds, and optional detection tags for cell surface expression.",

Single-cell genomics technologies have proven critical for understanding cellular diversity and function, enabling precise mapping of genetic and transcriptomic information at the level of individual cells. While single-cell genomics can identify cell types based on marker transcripts, there are no methods for isolating these populations for further downstream analysis. This is a particular challenge for studying rare cell types, including many involved in disease. Stanford researchers therefore developed a scalable assay that enables single-cell RNA sequencing profiles from complex subcellular mixtures defined by the presence or absence of RNA transcripts. This new strategy integrates single-molecule nucleic acid imaging (e.g., smFISH) with single-cell sequencing. Researchers were able to enrich and study rare cell populations from immune populations as well as fixed brain tissue. Overall, this innovative approach not only expands the applicability of single-cell genomics but also enhances our ability to explore cellular heterogeneity in greater detail, providing a powerful tool for both basic research and clinical applications.

    "ip_description": "Stem cells are generally influenced by a microenvironmental niche, typically comprised of epithelial and mesenchymal cells and extracellular substrates. Many attempts have been made to produce culture systems that mimic normal intestinal epithelial growth and differentiation. The tissue is largely inaccessible for experimental manipulation and time-series observation; thus, a long-term methodology will future investigations of intestinal biology. The Kuo lab at Stanford have developed the first robust method for the culture, proliferation and expansion of intestinal epithelium for greater than 140 days. The technique faithfully recapitulates numerous features of intestinal growth _in vivo_, including cellular ultrastructure, presence of enterocytes, goblet and enteroendocrine cells, and Wnt-dependent proliferation. The technology could be used for autologous transplant, cell therapy, and tissue engineering to treat patients with intestinal failure. In addition, the invention could be applied to drug development - for developing either a culture system to conduct ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) studies on new drug candidates or an _in vitro_ model for testing therapeutic agents against intestinal pathogens. Applications: * Intestinal transplantation - grow tissue from autologous cultures or ES cells for treatment of intestinal failure * ADME studies - culture system for absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion studies of new drug candidates * Gene therapy delivery system * Anti-infective drug screening - cultured epithelium could be used to create an _in vitro_ model to test therapeutic agents against intestinal pathogens. Advantages: * Long term culture - epithelium can be grown for over 140 days, previously primary intestinal epithelium has only been able to be cultured for 1-2 days. * Recapitulates features of _in vivo_ tissue: * cellular ultrastructure * enterocytes * goblet and enteroendocrine cells * Wnt-dependent proliferation.",

    "ip_description": "Patients with celiac disease have a pathological reaction to gluten and have either HLA-DQ2+ (90%) or HLA-DQ8+, but expression of these MHC class II haplotypes is not sufficient and other factors are necessary for the development of celiac sprue. Diagnosis of celiac disease is determined by presence of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) autoantibody and histology of intestinal biopsies. However, those seeking diagnosis often already maintain a gluten-free diet prior to gastroenterology consultation and therefore test negative for autoantibody and present normal duodenal mucosa. So, it is necessary to have patients receive a gluten-rich diet for weeks to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Celiac patients will thus experience symptoms including diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain. Air-liquid interface (ALI) organoids enable culturing epithelium and stroma to recapitulate the human small intestine, and patient-derived organoids can be used for suspected celiac patient diagnosis instead. ALI organoids could be used whether the individual is on a gluten-free diet or gluten-rich diet. Specifically, ALI organoids will be challenged with gliadin and examined for gliadin presentation, immune cell expansion and activation, and epithelial cell death. It could also be used to screen the potency of drug candidates by evaluating the reduction of gliadin-dependent immune cell activation or expansion and epithelial cell death.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Diagnosis of celiac disease using patient-derived organoids of the small intestine\n*   Monitoring the development of celiac disease with a precision medicine approach\n*   Drug discovery of therapeutic compounds for celiac disease\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   Current diagnosis relies on patients to ingest gluten, thereby inducing symptoms\n    *   Standard of care requires multiple analytic approaches that take weeks\n    *   ALI-based diagnosis enables less invasive, more efficient procedures\n*   Screening of drug candidates by measuring immune cell expansion and activation, and epithelial cell death",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have found that a vaccine, enhanced with adjuvants that imprint an antiviral state on innate immune cells and non-hematopoietic organ cells, could confer lasting nonspecific protection against diverse pathogens. Conventional vaccines are designed to produce antigen-specific antibodies or cytotoxic T cell responses against specific pathogens. However, some inadvertently invoke heterologous immunity against non-targeted antigens. This can be leveraged to design pathogen-agnostic universal vaccines. Recent studies suggest that both immunological memory in the adaptive immune system and trained immunity of innate immune system are involved. However, further investigation is needed to identify specific mechanisms to modulate to induce nonspecific immunity. Stanford researchers have found that the interaction between the adaptive and innate immune systems and non-hematopoietic cells in tissues is key to antigen-agnostic protective immunity. Based on their previous finding that BCG vaccine induces heterologous immunity via CD4 T-cell derived IFN-gamma, which imprints an antiviral state on the innate immune system and epithelial cells, they developed a vaccine containing antigen ovalbumin and GLA/3M-052 adjuvants, which elicit IFN-gamma responses. In vaccinated mice, antigen-stimulated T cells imprinted prolonged and broad innate-mediated antiviral resistance in myeloid and epithelial cells, protecting mice against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses, unrelated to the administered antigen. Applications: Stop-gap measure to prevent infection upon emergence of a new pathogen, Vaccines against prototype pathogens, Prophylactic treatment when anticipating increased exposure to pathogens.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have developed a working model that chemotherapy drugs induce peripheral neuropathy by activating a pathway that favors neuronal degeneration and impairs sensory neuron function. Combining modulation of factors downstream of this degenerative pathway with chemotherapy represents a promising strategy to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy without compromising tumor growth inhibition.\n\n40%-60% of patients treated with anticancer drugs develop chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN symptoms, such as tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, difficulty walking, and other challenges with daily activities, significantly deteriorate the quality of life and commonly develop into persistent, chronic neuropathic pain. As a result, the healthcare costs associated with CIPN are substantial, with treatment expenses for patients suffering from CIPN exceeding those for patients without the condition by $15,000 (in 2006 dollars). With the number of cancer survivors projected to top 20 million by 2030, preventing CIPN is both a pressing and a growing healthcare challenge.\n\nActivating the neuronal degenerative pathway through overexpression and treatment with a chemotherapy drug in C. elegans impairs touch sensation which recapitulates symptoms if CIPN seen in patients. Importantly, in mice, knockout animals that genetically lack the downstream factors are less sensitive to chemotherapy than their wild-type littermates suggesting inhibition of this pathway may be preventative of CPIN. Importantly, targeting downstream factors makes it unlikely that tumor growth inhibition will be compromised during chemotherapy.

    "ip_name": "A normothermic perfusion device combined with a stabilized form of WNT protein for organ rehabilitation prior to transplant",
    "ip_number": "S23-270",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Clinician-scientists at Stanford have proposed a WNT formulation that, when used in combination with a first-of-its-kind normothermic perfusion device, reconditions marginal organs and enables their safe transplantation. Each year, >100,000 people wait for organ transplant yet only 40,000 transplants are performed, leaving a waiting list of 60,000 patients with end-stage organ disease and no available options. A significant number of marginal organs are recovered but are not transplanted due to concerns of poor quality, suboptimal function, and limited regenerative capacity. What is critically needed to address this organ shortage are methods that allow for marginal organ rehabilitation, thus enabling them to be successfully transplanted without compromising patient outcomes. There are two features of the proposed technology. The first is a perfusion device that mimics heart function, an oxygenator that mimics lung function, and a dialysis system that mimics kidney function. The second feature is the use of a novel perfusate additive, liposome-packaged human WNT protein (L-WNT). WNTs are potent stem cell activators that activate endogenous stem cells and enhance cell viability, thereby improving engraftment efficiency. The unique perfusion device loosens the narrow time constraints for transplantation, thereby allowing in-depth organ evaluation and clinical intervention. The use of L-WNT raises the possibility of functional liver reconditioning. Such a regenerative intervention has the potential to dramatically reduce organ shortages and in doing so, transform the organ transplantation landscape. Applications: Enable organ procurement organizations (responsible for donor management, organ retrieval, organ preservation, and organ transportation) to retrieve marginal organs and optimize them ex vivo prior to dispersal. Enhance hospital systems with organ transplant programs that are responsible for organ preservation, optimization, and transplantation into intended recipients. Support hospitals with major oncologic and hepatobiliary programs that offer major resections or ablations of partial liver for benign and oncologic conditions. Advantages: The technology ameliorates ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI), thus reducing postoperative complications and their associated costs. The normothermic perfusion device with dialysis capabilities allows for sustained holding times, while the L-WNT perfusate additive enhances tissue repair and regeneration through its action on endogenous stem cells.",

The uSMAART (ultra-Sensitive Measurement of Aggregated Activity in Restricted cell-Types) technology enables the study of small dynamic variation of one or more biological process in the healthy and pathological brain from animal undergoing ecologically relevant behavior. Fiber photometry, a measurement technique that aggregates fluorescence signal using a fiber optic, is a highly pervasive approach in the field of systems neuroscience to study in vivo brain tissue dynamics during ecologically relevant behavior. Despite its common usage by researchers and companies alike, none of the state-of-the art fiber photometry device is capable of detecting small and fast signal changes in a low-light regime in freely behaving animals. Current technologies are benchmarked against cytosolic calcium indicators whose dynamic ranges far exceed that of the instrument and biological noises. Therefore, when used outside of this original configuration, i.e. with other fluorescent indicators (voltage, neuromodulator sensors\u2026) with much weaker dynamic ranges, these instruments do not protect against unwanted noise sources which can lead to biological confounds, especially when the instrumental noise correlates with the animal motion. Inventors at Stanford have developed a novel fiber-optic technology that achieve ~10 fold greater sensitivity than prior fiber photometry systems and is immune to optical artefacts induced by animal motions. The uSMAART (ultra-Sensitive Measurement of Aggregated Activity in Restricted cell-Types) technology tracks signals from up to 2 reporters from up to 2 different brain regions concurrently, with high sensitivity. The uSMAART system outperforms similar fiber photometry implementations in at least one of the three following aspects: (1) stability of illumination source, (2) immunity to fiber motion-induced illumination artefacts, and (3) detection sensitivity in the visible range. The novel technology offers a low-cost, flexible, and highly sensitive tool to decipher the precise temporal relationship of multiple physiological processes from multiple brain regions simultaneously.",

    "ip_description": "Inventors at Stanford have developed a novel strategy to perform concurrent fluorescence measurements of multiple biological parameters in freely moving and head-restrained animals. As more genetically encoded fluorescent indicators (GEFI) are being developed to monitor, in living animals, a wide range of biological phenomenon (e.g. transmembrane voltage, ions, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, opioids, pH\u2026), optical approaches that capture the precise temporal relationship of many physiological processes simultaneously in awake animals become critically necessary. Unlike our invention, none of the existing technologies offers the experimental flexibility to combine multiple fluorescence sensors and monitor those signals.\n\nTwo of the most common optical tools in neuroscience to study in vivo brain tissue dynamics during ecologically relevant behavior are fiber photometry and mesoscopic imaging. Fiber photometry is a measurement technique that aggregates fluorescence signal using a fiber optic. While it captures signal at the tip of the fiber, mesoscope imaging will instead capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of the fluorescence signal in awake, head-fixed animals. Recent studies have used both techniques to optically sense voltage, calcium, or neuromodulator dynamics in a variety mouse behavior.\n\nHowever, none of the state-of-the art fiber photometry devices or 1-photon epifluorescence mesoscope systems are capable of imaging more than 1 biological parameter at once while precisely referencing biological noises. Indeed, until now, there has not been a suitable method to account for various biological artifacts while imaging 2 spectrally orthogonal fluorescent proteins that capture two independent biological parameters. Therefore, while multiplexing fluorescent signals gain more appeal in the field, molecular strategy and technological implementations to achieve this with high sensitivity and low cost is needed.\n\nHere, we introduce a new molecular strategy and offer two technological implementations for fiber photometry and mesoscope imaging. While the former relies on a lock-in amplification technique, the latter relies on precise control over the illumination activation and imaging frame acquisition. Our simple molecular solution can be used with any fiber photometry systems (used in freely behaving animals) or 1-photon epifluorescence wide-field imaging techniques (used in head-fixed animals) to probe the dynamics of multiple molecular phenomena concurrently in awake animals. This strategy is universally applicable to any fluorescent reporters, from genetically encoded fluorescent proteins to synthetic dyes and nanoparticles. This strategy will reduce by 50% the cost of instrumentations used for fluorescence multiplexing of dynamic processes.\n\nStage of Development: Research \u2013 in vivo \u2013 working prototype and proof-of-concept in mice\n\nApplications:\n- Neuroscience research\n- Medical Diagnostics and Treatment Monitoring\n- Pharmaceutical Development, Drug discovery platform\n- Analytic chemistry\n\nAdvantages:\n- A cost-effective method to multiplex fluorescence signals.\n- Simultaneous dual biological parameters with identical performance, in freely and head-restrained behaving mouse.\n- Safeguarding against instrumental and/or biological artefacts.\n- Universally applicable to any fluorescent reporters, from genetically encoded fluorescent proteins to synthetic dyes and nanoparticles.",

Fabrication with durable materials is essential for manufacturing of many composite structures, such as vehicles, airplanes, and satellites. Traditionally, these have been fabricated using aluminum due to its durability, but composite laminates would provide a lighter, more cost-effective solution. Despite this, composite laminates have been difficult to apply due to their complex, non-homogenized nature. Now, the Tsai lab at Stanford has proposed a novel double-double laminate design to overcome the challenges of traditional composites. This design enables perfect homogenization, eliminating shear- and stretch-bend coupling. Consequently, it improves upon metals by offering lighter weight, higher stiffness, and better possibilities for tapering. As a result, the double-double laminate solves problems of complexity and sub-optimal outputs associated with previous composites. Applications include reduced weight and cost of composite structures in medical devices and prosthetics, automotive and aerospace industry, industrial machinery and equipment, space and satellite compositions, high-performance sport equipment, and infrastructure and civil engineering. Advantages include being lighter than metals, more durable than metals, higher stiffness than metals, better tapering due to the orthotropic nature of ply, and cheaper than metals.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have found that applying pressure to macroencapsulation can enhance insulin transport from encapsulated islet beta cells to surrounding tissue and assist in glucose metabolism in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients. T1D is an autoimmune disease in which insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed by the patient's own immune system. The resulting insulin deficiency is most often managed through exogenous insulin administration. This requires frequent or constant blood glucose level monitoring and insulin administration, significantly diminishing the patient's quality of life. Many studies have suggested transplantation of macroencapsulated islet beta cells as a means to achieve insulin independence. The encapsulation can provide a robust barrier against the host immune system. However, it could also impede insulin diffusion from the encapsulation, making it difficult to release insulin at physiological levels. Stanford researchers have discovered that applying pressure to the macroencapsulation could enhance insulin transport kinetics. A modest pressure equivalent to normal diastolic blood pressure sufficiently improved insulin flux across encapsulating membranes. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that pressure-driven flow is superior to relying solely on diffusion. Transplantation of the pressurized macroencapsulation of beta islets could help T1D patients achieve full insulin independence. Applications: Cadaveric, donor, or stem cell-derived beta islet transplantation, Artificial pancreas, In vivo cell-based bioelectronics.

Emphysema is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease characterized by irreversible damage to the lung's air sacs. Severe emphysema can be treated with lung volume reduction surgery, which involves resection of the affected areas. However, many patients are not candidates for this invasive procedure. An existing less invasive treatment option, bronchoscopic endobronchial valve placement, is often ineffective due to collateral ventilation through damaged airways. To develop an alternative, Stanford researchers have repurposed stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, commonly used to treat acute lung cancer. Irradiation can noninvasively induce scarring in the treated lung tissue, resulting in volume reduction. Through a phase I clinical trial in severe emphysema patients, optimal strategies for radiation dose distribution and patient selection were determined. Stereotactic irradiation for lung volume reduction (SILVR) has the potential to become a noninvasive and efficacious treatment option for patients with severe emphysema. Applications: Treatment for severe emphysema, Focused emphysematous tissue, Homogeneous tissue damage across the lung. Advantages: Noninvasive, Efficacious, Uses existing radiotherapy devices and techniques.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a novel method for programmable macromolecule delivery via engineered cells, using trogocytosis. Genome editing technologies have revolutionized the field of personalized medicine. Despite its initial promise, many of these methods have failed to deliver useful clinical therapeutics. Two commonly used methods, AAV and nanoparticles, lack flexibility in their cellular specificity programming to be widely used in tissue or cell specific diseases. Engineered cells have emerged as promising delivery vehicles, but current engineering methods lack specific and programmable macromolecule delivery. Cells have evolved several methods of direct molecule exchange that have cell type specificity, including trogocytosis. Trogocytosis is favorable because it has been shown to be bidirectional, and it maintains the functional integrity of the transported molecules. However, engineered macromolecule delivery methods have yet to capitalize on this method of cell-to-cell transport. The inventors have created a novel cell engineering strategy (TRANSFER) for the delivery of macromolecules in a cell specific fashion. More specifically, the inventors have harnessed the power of trogocytosis to deliver macromolecules from an engineered cell to another cell in vivo, allowing for targeted delivery while maintaining the functional integrity of the macromolecules being transported. The macromolecules can subsequently be freed from endosomes in recipient cells and optionally functionalized in a trogocytosis-like pH-responsive membrane fusion. This method is fully programmable and allows for tissue and cell specific targeting as well as the delivery of many different macromolecules. Applications: Programmable and specific delivery of functional molecules into various cell types. Advantages: Fully programmable delivery of most macromolecules to tissue specific or cell specific targets, Tunable, efficient, and versatile delivery method.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a novel method for the mapping of nucleic acid binding or modifying proteins in a massively multiplexed manner. Next generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed for sequence-agnostic sequencing and has revolutionized every area of biomedical science. One application of NGS is assaying the nucleic acid binding or modifying for a single protein interacting with thousands to millions of sequences simultaneously. However, increasing the number of proteins assayed has been difficult, costly, and labor-intensive. In another vein, microfluidics platforms have allowed for the parallel assessment of binding affinities of a several sequences with hundreds of transcription factors (TFs). Microfluidic technology has not yet been leveraged to assay the binding of many TFs to many sequences in parallel. The inventors have developed a novel approach to assay many sequences and many proteins binding affinity at the same time. Specifically, they use a barcode and print approach that links particular members of pooled sequenced libraries to specific protein variants that interact with the particular library members. Briefly, a barcoded library of sequences and a library of proteins that are imprinted at discrete locations to provide a barcode of sorts for the protein variant are created and pooled. These libraries are then put through a microfluidic device separately such that each microfluidic droplet contains one protein variant and one sequence. These are then incubated with a capture agent that binds to variant proteins and the captured sequences bound to the variant proteins are sequenced. This allows for the assessment of many different protein-sequence binding partners in a single assay. Applications include high throughput assessment of many different protein-sequence interactions in the same assay. Advantages include the ability to produce measurements of 100,000+ protein-sequence interactions in a single day and reducing costs associated with performing many assays vs one assay with the proposed method.",

Electronic fibers, with electronic components integrated into one-dimensional form, present a wide range of opportunities for applications across various fields, from consumer electronics to healthcare and more. Their unique one-dimensional structure allows for more compactness and deformability compared to 2D and 3D systems. Unfortunately, currently available electronic fibers are manufactured through complex processes, such as fiber spinning, 3D printing, microfluidics, and thermal drawing. As a result, they suffer from bulkiness, rigidity, and low density and imprecise positioning of active components. Stanford researchers have devised a strategy to manufacture high density and versatile electronic fibers by transforming microfabricated 2D films into 1D fibers using spiral transformation. This approach takes advantage of well-established microfabrication techniques developed for planar substrates, simplifying the manufacturing process while giving precise control of positions of the active components. The researchers have demonstrated that centimeter-scale 2D thin films with micro-patterned components can be rolled into micro-scale electronic fibers. They have successfully built and tested electronic fibers for gastrointestinal monitoring/stimulation and neural recording. This new manufacturing method can make electronic fibers more accessible for a wide range of applications. Applications include Probes, Guidewires, Pacemakers, Deep brain stimulation, Neural recording, Smart biopsy needles, Electronic sutures, Electronic textiles, Soft robotics, Wearables, and Sensors.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have discovered that blocking an immune receptor signal can lead to increased fat uptake and weight reduction in patients suffering from obesity and associated diseases. Blocking the immune signal can be applied in various contexts, such as treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetic nephropathy, and metabolic syndrome among other metabolic diseases. Obesity is a global issue and commonly associated with conditions such as liver dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The lack of effective therapeutics, coupled with a predicted 57% of the world population having an obesity-related condition by 2030, necessitates the development of novel treatment options. Blocking the immune receptor signal in a fatty liver disease mouse model led to a ~28% decrease in weight and complete removal of abdominal fat over 10 weeks in treated mice relative to control mice. Additionally, a verified biomarker in the form of a risk allele is available which can be used to quickly and reliably determine if patients are likely to benefit from the treatment. Consequently, blocking agents for the immune receptor have the potential to enhance and complement current treatment options for obesity, such as weight management and GLP-1 agonists, and serve as a broadly useful treatment strategy for patients suffering from obesity-related conditions. Applications: Treatment of obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and hyperglycemia; Treatment of chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the liver and other organs; Combined treatment with current available options such as weight management and GLP-1 agonists. Advantages: Treatment agents can be readily developed (antibodies, peptides, etc.); Biomarker is available to identify patients that will likely benefit from treatment; Flexible dosage and administration.",

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common leukemia in adults, with over 20,000 new cases a year in the US and a five-year overall survival rate of only 27%. While reliable methods for predicting patient outcomes in AML could aid clinical decision making by e.g. predicting which patients would benefit from more aggressive treatment, AML risk is currently evaluated by a complex combination of factors including age, patient performance status, cytogenetics, and medical history. This method is unreliable particularly for the 30% of patients that lack genetic abnormalities associated with clinical outcomes. To address this, Stanford researchers discovered transcriptional programs in AML that are associated with either improved or worse patient outcomes. Researchers treated AML patient cells with human immune cells, identifying subsets of AML cells that are either sensitive or resistant to immune cell killing. Immune-resistant AML cells were found to express RNA transcripts associated with poor survival rates in a large database of AML patient transcriptomes. Better and poorer patient outcomes could be predicted from the expression of RNAs associated with sensitivity and resistance to immune cell killing. Stage of Development: Proof of concept: AML patient cells that are resistant to immune cell killing in vitro express transcripts associated with poorer patient outcomes, while patient cells that are sensitive to immune cell killing express transcripts associated with improved outcomes. Applications: Molecular diagnostic tests for AML patient risk stratification, Pre-clinical research in AML. Advantages: More quantitative and reliable than current methods for patient risk assessment in AML, Easy to implement using established workflows for RNA sequencing or qPCR, Can be performed non-invasively from a peripheral blood sample or from diagnostic bone marrow aspirate (already used to diagnose AML).",

Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies represent a burgeoning field of immunotherapy, enabling the customization of a patient's immune system to combat tumor cells. However, current iterations of CAR-T cell therapies face limitations in achieving enduring remission against various liquid and solid tumors, primarily stemming from issues like inadequate persistence and the development of T cell exhaustion. In order to enhance CAR T cell efficacy, researchers from Crystal Mackall's group have identified the transcription factor FOXO1 as critical to CAR T cell antitumor potency. Furthermore, they find that overexpression of FOXO1 mediates a memory-like phenotype in CAR T cells, thus identifying an axis through which CAR T cells can be modulated to prevent the development of exhaustion, promote persistence, and enhance adoptive cell therapy in the fight against cancer. Applications include CAR-T therapeutics, TIL therapeutics, TCR T-cell therapeutics, therapeutics for liquid tumors, and therapeutics for solid tumors.

To create any type of human blood or immune cells in vitro, hPSCs must first be differentiated into HSC-like cells. Previous differentiation methods yielded heterogeneous cell populations, with HSC-like cells constituting only a small fraction. Also, the resulting HSC-like cells displayed limited expression of key HSC transcription factors. Stanford researchers devised a system to differentiate hPSCs into >90% pure HSC-like cells that express transcription factors at levels comparable to human HSCs, by involving a transition through an artery intermediate. The resulting hPSC-derived HSC-like cells can be differentiated into a range of blood and immune cell-types, including myeloid cells, erythroid cells, T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. Replacing diseased blood or immune cells with these engineered cells is a promising treatment approach for many different diseases, including cancers, autoimmune disorders, and genetic diseases. Furthermore, adding new functionalities to these cells could allow for more targeted treatment options. Applications include cancers (Leukemia, Lymphoma), autoimmune disorders (Type I diabetes, Multiple sclerosis), genetic diseases (Sickle cell anemia, Inborn immunodeficiencies), blood transfusions, and disease modeling.

Accurate and reliable cell classification using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is crucial for disease diagnosis, yet challenges persist using current methods which rely on error-prone and time-consuming manual annotations. Moreover, existing AI approaches lack interpretability and struggle with spatial resolution limitations, hindering precise analysis of cell types. Hence, prior efforts at automation have been hampered by inefficient manual annotation processes, limiting analysis to few cell types, and yielding suboptimal results. To address these challenges, Stanford researchers have developed an innovative method using mIF imaging to accurately classify cells in H&E-stained images, providing a robust ground truth based on protein markers. This approach enables the identification of diverse cell types with higher accuracy and generates extensive data for training deep learning models. By training on this ground truth, deep learning models outperform existing methods, facilitating precise cell type identification for personalized treatment decisions in precision medicine. In summary, this automated cell classification approach not only eliminates manual annotations but also ensures reliable, accurate and biologically interpretable results, marking a significant advancement in histopathology. Stage of Development: Software Prototype. Next steps involve validating model in lung tumors and expanding to different tumor types. Future steps also involve spatial analysis to predict patient outcomes, paving the way for companion diagnostics in immunotherapy.

Immunotherapy is a cancer treatment approach that modulates the patient's immune system to target and eliminate tumor cells. While it has greatly improved the outlook for patients with liquid tumor cancer, its effectiveness against solid tumors, which account for most cancers, has been relatively low. This is because solid tumor cells release chemokines to their microenvironment to attract certain cells that exert immunosuppressive effects. Accumulation of these cells leads to immunosuppression, tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis \u2013 all of which could interfere with cancer treatment. Therefore, removing these cells from the microenvironment could help improve patient prognosis.

    "ip_description": "Inherently, the telomeres located at the ends of chromosomes shorten during each cycle of DNA replication and cell division, eventually topping DNA replication and leading to cell senescence and death. Cancer cells have unlimited replication potential and evade cell senescence by preventing telomere shortening. They depend on aberrant expression of the enzyme telomerase for their ability to continue to propagate in their victims. Consequently, development of anti-cancer therapies that target telomerase has been attempted. However, success of such therapies has been limited, and this has been attributed to the slowness of attrition of nucleotide repeat sequences of telomeric DNA, and importantly, to the ability of cancer cells to develop alternative (ALT) methods of telomere elongation. The technology being marketed teaches a novel approach to telomere shortening that is accomplished by preventing RNA transcript elongation on telomeric DNA templates.\n\nStanford researchers have identified SUPT4H1, a component of DSIF complex as a target for preventing growth of ALT-dependent cancer cells. Inhibiting SUPT4H1's action affects transcription of TERRA, a non-coding RNA synthesized using telomeric DNA as template. Inhibiting SUPT4H1's actions reduces the ability of the RNA polymerase to produce TERRA transcripts required by ALT, leading to telomere shortening (Figure 1) and consequently to cessation of cell division. The SUPT4H1 gene and its partner in formation of the DSIF complex can be inhibited using established gene silencing methods or chemical compounds. Some such compounds have been identified and have been shown to affect the actions of SUPT4H1 and SUPT5H in vitro and in vivo.\n\nApplications:\n- Treatment of cancers by interference with telomere elongation.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Affects ALT-dependent telomere elongation\n- Can be implemented using any of the established gene silencing techniques.\n- No existing competitive product",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a new technology, Variant-FlowFISH, to enable high-throughput, highly sensitive measurements of how variants, introduced via CRISPR, affect gene expression. It is challenging to therapeutically modulate gene expression only in specific cell types to treat disease. One solution would be to reprogram the gene regulatory sequences in the genome, which control gene expression in cell-type specific ways. Stanford researchers have developed a new technology, called Variant Flow-FISH, that efficiently edits the human genome as desired and is also able to measure the effects of the variants on gene expression. The technology involves three steps: pools of edits are introduced into the human genome using CRISPR prime editing, ii) cells are sorted via FACS into 6 bins based on gene expression levels using RNA FlowFISH, iii) DNA sequencing is performed to determine the frequency of edits across the 6 bins and determine the effect of the variants on gene expression. Stanford inventors have successfully applied the technology to identify specific synthetic sequences that can be introduced into a non-coding regulatory sequence at the PPIF locus, to change expression of the PPIF gene in monocytes, a gene linked to inflammatory bowel disease. Variant Flow-FISH was used to introduce hundreds of noncoding variants into cells in a single experiment and measure each of the variants' effects on the expression of the _PPIF_ gene. Applications: Characterizing disease variants in their endogenous genomic context, Identify gene sequence changes to tune gene expression, Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, Decrease PPIF gene expression in monocytes, Therapeutics for Coronary Artery Disease. Advantages: Avoids deriving single-cell clonal populations, Quantitative, Detects small effects on gene expression (5-10%), Fast: ~3-4 weeks for editing and reading out effects on the gene expression, Overcomes inherent inefficiencies/inaccuracies of CRISPR: inefficient editing or multiple indels, Variant Flow-FISH measures the effect of each allele through pooled sequencing and analysis of allele frequencies in a population of cells.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a high-affinity IL-11 decoy cytokine for super-agonism and antagonism of the IL-11 receptor, enabling the treatment of a wide variety of diseases from inflammatory disease to cancer as well as research into IL-11 signaling pathways. Interleukin-11 (IL-11) signaling plays a significant role in many diseases through its roles in inflammation, tissue repair, and cancer progression. For example, IL-11 blocking antibodies are in clinical development for pulmonary fibrosis while wild-type IL-11 is approved as a treatment for thrombocytopenia. However, stronger binders to the IL-11 receptor have the potential to be more effective treatments. Stanford researchers therefore developed an IL-11 decoy cytokine with much higher affinity for the IL-11 receptor than the wild-type cytokine. High-throughput combinatorial screening identified mutations to IL-11 that increased its binding affinity to the IL-11 receptor 70-fold. Researchers identified additional mutations that converted this super-agonist to an antagonist by ablating binding to the gp130 co-receptor. Finally, they identified other mutations that enabled high-affinity binding to the mouse IL-11 receptor (~10-fold over wildtype) without affecting human IL-11 receptor binding. This engineered cytokine slows the growth of tumors in a mouse model of non-small cell lung cancer. Applications include IL-11 antagonists for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory disease, and fibrotic disease; IL-11 agonists for the treatment of thrombocytopenia; and research in IL-11 signaling. Advantages include high specificity for the IL-11 receptor, high affinity binding to the human IL-11 receptor (~70-fold higher than endogenous IL-11), high affinity binding to the mouse IL-11 receptor (~10-fold higher than endogenous mouse IL-11) to enable research in mouse models, and small size allowing for diffusion into tumors (~19 kDa cytokine vs ~150 kDa antibodies).",

    "ip_description": "Pharmacologic agents are commonly used to treat psychiatric diseases. These compounds, however, react differently across patients, are often followed by negative side effects and can have varied efficacy timeframes. Unfortunately, determining the efficacy and side-effect profile for therapeutics can be a time-consuming and costly process. To circumvent this issue, inventors at Stanford have designed a solution to analyze patient-specific drug responses by integrating organoids within a microfluidic chip for tissue culture and high-throughput screening. Microfluidics allows precision control of fluid flow to determine parameters like nutrient delivery, mechanical stimulus, and drug delivery at the microscale level, all by using a thousand-fold smaller volume of materials compared to standard plate assays. Using the chip, users can measure how drugs of interest would act in the patient's body by using a small skin sample. As a proof of concept, the inventors utilized the platform to model antidepressant effects on the gut-brain axis. The system seeds gut organoids with patient-representative gut microbiota onto a microfluidic chip, through which the drugs can be run through. Then, the inventors measured serotonin concentration as an output indicative of gut serotonin production over the course of treatment with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). The output provided a snapshot into how different SSRIs affect the gut microbiome and gut serotonin production on a patient-specific basis, while laying the foundation for understanding variability in treatment response. Overall, the platform enables a high accuracy, high throughput, patient-centered approach for screening drug responses that increases the potential for positive therapeutic outcomes.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a pioneering gene therapy by targeting reactive astrocytes in the optic nerve head (ONH) and modulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels for targeted treatment of glaucoma and other retinal disorders. Despite the increasing prevalence of retinal disorders like glaucoma in the US, effective targeted therapies for afflicted patients are scarce. Current treatments, such as eye drops, merely aim to slow disease progression without addressing the root cause. Despite the pivotal role of ONH astrocytes driving the pathogenesis of glaucoma and various optic neuropathies, there is a lack of therapeutic methods targeting this cell population in retinal disorders. Addressing this gap is crucial for developing effective targeted treatments for irreversible conditions like glaucoma and other retinal disorders. Stanford researchers have filled this critical gap by pioneering a gene therapy solution targeting reactive astrocytes in the optic nerve for the treatment of glaucoma and other inner retinal disorders. These astrocytes, when injured, differentiate into either protective or harmful reactive astrocytes, which are controlled by cAMP. This invention specifically modulates the cAMP levels, either by increasing nuclear or depleting cytosolic cAMP, promoting the proliferation of protective astrocytes, and inhibiting harmful ones, ultimately aiding in retinal ganglion cell survival after optic nerve injury in glaucoma. By targeting specific reactive astrocyte populations and modulating compartmented cAMP, this invention marks a significant advancement in targeted gene therapy and holds promise for treating glaucoma and other inner retinal disorders. Stage of Development: Pre-clinical. Next steps involve continued testing in preclinical models of glaucoma, followed by large animal proof-of-concept and toxicology studies. Applications: Targeted gene therapy for glaucoma and other inner retinal disorders, Treatment of optic neuropathies, Prophylaxis of CNS disorders, Gliotherapeutics.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have developed a novel hydrogel for long-term drug delivery of an Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) inhibitor for the prevention of post-surgical abdominal adhesion. Abdominal adhesions are fibrotic scars that form between abdominal organs and occur in 50-90% of abdominal operations. Their work shows that the formulation prevents adhesion and does not hinder healing at the site of surgery. There are currently no effective standard-of-care anti-adhesion treatments for abdominal adhesion, therefore, this has the potential to immensely improve clinical care.\n\nAdhesions occur post-operatively in 50- 90% of all open abdominal operations, representing an enormous clinical problem impacting hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. Currently, there is no standard-of-care treatment to prevent adhesions which can cause bowel obstruction, chronic pain, and/or infertility. T-5224 is a small molecule inhibitor of the Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex, and local application of the drug has previously been shown to prevent abdominal adhesion. But, a practical and effective delivery method of the drug has not been developed for clinical use.\n\nUsing a mouse and porcine model of abdominal adhesions, the researchers found the hydrogel formulation promotes sustained release of T-5224 and inhibits adhesion formation in vivo. Importantly, no negative side effects were observed. Consequently, sustained release of AP-1 inhibitors to the surgical site has the potential to drastically improve post-surgical outcomes by eliminating abdominal adhesion in patients.\n\n**Stage of Development:**\n\n*   Preclinical\n*   Continued research \u2013 Validation in a porcine model, application for ongoing grant support\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Prevention of abdominal adhesions in patients following surgical operations or intra-abdominal infection\n*   Treatment of other peritoneal diseases related to fibrosis (e.g., peritoneal carcinomatosis)\n*   Fibrosis elsewhere in the body (e.g., prevention of pleural or pericardial fibrosis in the context of surgical procedures in the chest or prevention of adhesions after tendon repairs)\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   These findings represent a topical formulation for an effective anti-adhesion treatment\n*   No effective standard-of-care anti-adhesion therapies exist\n*   Potential significant advancement in the prevention of abdominal adhesions",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a new, low-cost method for tumor methylation profiling that enables tumor classification even from low amounts of fragmented DNA characteristic of liquid biopsies. Methylation profiling has emerged as a critical tool in the diagnosis and classification of cancer. The abnormal patterns of gene methylation found in cancer cells can enable early diagnosis, cancer type classification, prognosis assessment, and treatment monitoring. However, available methods for classifying methylation status are lacking. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing is prohibitively costly, while methylation arrays are limited by a requirement for high amounts of input DNA and poor overlap with cell-type markers critical for tumor classification. Other methods are also not suited for the fragmented DNA and low tumor cellularity found in many biopsies. Stanford researchers therefore developed a new method for methylation classification (\"XR-methylseq\") that is low cost, unbiased, enables tumor type classification, and suitable for low, fragmented DNA inputs (down to 250 pg). DNA fragments are ligated to an adapter, digested with a restriction enzyme at CCGG motifs, and ligated to a second adapter. Fragments are enzymatically converted to distinguish methylation status and only fragments with both adapters are amplified and sequenced. Researchers demonstrated that this technique can accurately classify CNS tumors from CSF, which is not possible using other methods due to the low DNA content and tumor cellularity found in CSF. Applications: Analysis of both solid and liquid biopsies (e.g., urine, CSF, biopsy supernatant), Diagnosis and classification of cancer, Early cancer detection, Prediction of cancer prognosis, Personalized cancer treatment, Minimal residual disease testing, Monitoring of treatment response and resistance, Basic research into methylation profiles. Advantages: Overlaps with cell type markers to enable tumor classification, Uses enzymatic digestion instead of harsh bisulfite chemistries that break DNA, Works with low DNA inputs (250 pg) and low tumor cellularity, Low cost, Works with fragmented DNA often seen in biopsies, Highly correlated with WGBS gold standard (not biased), 95%+ on-target rate, leading to an 18-fold enrichment at CCGG flanks.",

Fibrosis represents a major cause of morbidity worldwide and can involve a wide variety of organs and tissues. It is estimated that 45% of deaths in the United States are attributable to major-organ fibrosis (e.g., myocardial infarct, stroke, liver cirrhosis), fibroproliferative disorders (e.g., scleroderma, myelofibrosis), and scarring associated with trauma.

Verteporfin has the potential to prevent millions of patients around the world from suffering with large, distressing scars. Hundreds of millions of patients worldwide develop new scars every year, and scars and their associated problems cost the United States over $20 billion every year. Despite the high demand for scar treatments, there is currently no drug on the market that can successfully prevent or reverse scarring. The Longaker lab has uncovered the cell signaling process that results in scarring and have found that the FDA approved drug Verteporfin can dramatically reduce scarring and improve wound appearance when injected directly after wounding. When wounded mice were injected with Verteporfin, their healed connective tissue was stronger than scarred skin and their healed skin closely resembled healthy, unwounded skin. Further, while typical scarred skin lacks hair follicles and sweat glands, Verteporfin allowed the regrowth of these very important skin elements. While the Longaker lab knows that Verteporfin has the potential to dramatically improve scarring of wounded skin, they also postulate that this treatment could have positive effects on other fibrotic processes present in other areas of the body. Given that Verteporfin is already FDA approved as an injectable, this drug is already known to be clinically safe.",

    "ip_description": "Skin wounds invariably heal by developing fibrotic scar tissue, which can result in devastating disfigurement, growth restriction and permanent functional loss. Despite a plethora of clinical options and an enormous consumer market for scar treatment; no current therapeutic strategy prevents or reverses this fibrotic process. Inventors at Stanford developed a novel method of use of Piezo1 and Piezo2 inhibitors in the prevention of skin scarring. Piezo channels are mechanosensitive ion channels that mediate stretch sensation. Piezo1 and Piezo2 inhibitors inhibit cellular mechanical signaling, an important contributor to scarring and fibrosis. Using a mouse model of wound healing, we find that a single dose of piezo1 or piezo2 treatment (local injection) reduces scarring and fibrosis, specifically via adipocytes as they are mechanically sensitive. Aside from physically offloading wound tension through specialized wound dressings, no effective therapy for skin scarring exists. No targeted molecular agents have been able to reduce scar burden while not comprising or delaying wound repair. The novel method not only reduces scarring, but also improves scar appearance and allows for regrowth of skin elements such as hair follicles and sweat glands (absent in scars), which are highly significant outcomes for patients suffering from skin scarring.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Scar prevention in the skin\n*   Inhibition of mechanical sensing in adipocytes\n*   Treatment of organ fibrosis\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   Currently, there is no effective drug that can overcome skin fibrosis in the skin. The inventors have provided a drug that not only inhibits fibrosis in the skin, but has potential in other organs where fat accumulation contributes to organ fibrosis.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford inventors have developed a novel diagnostic tool that identifies distinct immune signatures in the peripheral blood of osteoarthritis patients using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and applied machine learning. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease characterized by joint dysfunction and several adverse effects on life, commonly affecting older people. No disease-modifying drugs exist, making major joint replacement surgery the only viable long-term solution. A critical hindrance to developing disease-modifying drugs for osteoarthritis is its usual late detection in patients, making it challenging to reverse disease pathogenesis. Immune cell involvement in OA pathogenesis has been identified, but the specific cell types involved, their spatiotemporal dynamics in disease, and cellular crosstalk that results in joint degeneration have not been extensively studied. Studying the peripheral blood of patients is a low-cost, accessible way to gain insight into the OA immune landscape. Stanford researchers identified differentially abundant immune populations in OA peripheral blood using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and deployed machine learning to identify OA immune signatures. They also profiled at-risk populations like patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears and degenerative meniscal tears (DMT). Hence, they compiled the first comprehensive immune cell atlas for OA and at-risk patients. Applications: Diagnostic kit for early detection of osteoarthritis.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed computational modeling methods for improved prediction of gestational age and time to delivery. This work is based on the identification of blood metabolites in pregnant women that can accurately predict gestational age and provide insights into pregnancy variations undetected by ultrasound (currently the most accurate timing method for pregnancy). In the new method, a computational model, trained using temporally aligned analyte measurements derived from a cohort of pregnant individuals, is used to assess metabolite data sampled from a pregnant subject over one or more time points. This approach aligns temporal data to evaluate gestational age, time to labor, preterm birth, and preterm abortion including diagnostics to be utilized for clinical interventions. Accurate estimation of the timing of pregnancy and birth is important for many clinical decisions in obstetrics, including determination of preterm birth and related treatment regimens. However, current clinical methods are based on information about the last menstruation date, which can be imprecise, or ultrasound imaging, which depends on accessibility at early pregnancy. Moreover, the accuracy of ultrasound for estimating gestational age is suboptimal, with only 40% of the newborns delivered within 7 days of the predicted due dates.\n\nA recent study by the researchers demonstrated that the development of clinical tools with a few metabolites in maternal blood to time pregnancy is promising. Testing of blood drawn from the pregnant woman would likely be limited to once or a few times to be informative and have the potential to benefit pregnant women in both the developed and developing worlds.\n\nApplications:\n- Predicting gestational age and delivery\n\nAdvantages:\n- Accuracy is significantly improved compared to prior technology using blood metabolites\n- There is a great need for accurate timing of pregnancy: in the U.S. alone, 900,000 women annually missed their first-trimester ultrasound",

Binding moieties expressed on viruses and virus-like system can target desired specific cell types and bind off-the-shelf or custom antibodies in a plug-and-play manner. Cell and gene therapies rely on successful delivery of therapeutic genetic payloads to specific cells or tissues. Retroviruses are used to directly integrate genetic payloads into the target cell for long-term, heritable, and stable expression of the gene. A major challenge in the field remains highly selective transduction to specific cell types. Stanford researchers have addressed the selectivity problem by developing a retrovirus that is decorated by a binding moiety that either directly binds the cell of interest through a cell binding domain (CBD) or binds an antibody/antibody fragment/ligand (ABD) that then binds the cell. The system is expandable to virus-like particles (VLPs). Proof of Concept: Researchers have demonstrated the CD7 version of CBD and the FITC and biotin versions of the ABD for delivery into various types of immune cells including T cells, NK cells, and monocytes. Applications: Cell and gene therapy. Advantages: Increases retroviral transduction space and specificity, Can engineer cells that cannot be transduced by traditional lentiviruses, such as CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and monocytes, Universal: one virus design can be conjugated with any antibody to target any cell, Facile, Modularly switchable cell specificity, Minimal off-target transduction, ABD/CBD not integrated to host cell genome ensures no downstream problems, System can be integrated into virus like particles (VLPs).",

    "ip_description": "A team of Stanford researchers has identified a group of small molecules that can prevent or reverse T cell exhaustion, thereby increasing the effectiveness of adoptive T cell therapies to fight cancer or chronic infections. Immunotherapy using CAR-T cells relies on T cell receptor (TCR) signaling to activate the cells that will mediate potent antitumor or anti-infective effects. However, over time, chronic signaling through the endogenous TCR or CAR can induce a dysfunctional state called 'T cell exhaustion', reducing the overall effectiveness of therapy. Moreover, CARs are prone to antigen independent signaling in vitro and in vivo, further underscoring the need to modulate CAR signaling to preserve CAR T function. The inventors utilized small molecules to inhibit protein kinases and address this overstimulation problem. Since proximal kinases are necessary to transmit TCR and CAR signaling, modulating their effects in a rational manner can enhance CAR-T cell function. This approach could be used in vivo or ex vivo to expand genetically engineered T cells that are less exhausted and therefore more potent. This reversible 'CAR-T switch' system transiently inhibits TCR or CAR signaling to prevent or reverse T cell exhaustion and restore T cell function, with applications in basic research or immunotherapy for infectious disease or cancer.\n\nThe inventors initially used a known, FDA-approved drug to demonstrate the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on reversing T cell exhaustion and augmenting T cell function in vivo. Further studies and collaborations with additional Stanford researchers have demonstrated similar effects using different, novel compounds.\n\nCAR-T cells expanded ex vivo in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors maintained a memory-like phenotype, which is associated with improved clinical responses in patients. When these cells were infused into mice, they: a) demonstrated profoundly augmented proliferative capacity and persistence in vivo and b) exhibited durable control of leukemia or osteosarcoma compared to CAR-T cells expanded in the absence of the inhibitors.\n\nApplications:\n- **Immunotherapy** - Prevent or reverse T cell exhaustion in cell therapy for cancer or chronic infection for:\n    - Ex vivo expansion of engineered CAR-T cells\n    - In vivo modulation of CAR or T cell receptor signaling\n- **Research** \u2013 methods using protein kinase inhibitors could be used to study basic T cell function and signaling\n\nAdvantages:\n- **Enhanced CAR-T** immunotherapy:\n    - Preventing or reversing T cell exhaustion could improve effectiveness of immunotherapy for cancer or chronic infections\n    - Could improve cytotoxicity, proliferative capacity and/or cytokine secretion\n- **Transient effects** \u2013 Transient and reversible effects on CAR and T cell receptor signaling, providing a mechanism for T cells to 'rest' and maintain or restore functionality\n- **Direct modulation** - addresses root cause of T cell exhaustion (i.e., continuous TCR signaling) instead of relying on accessory pathways (such as PD-1/PD-L1)",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a next-generation protein sequencing platform capable of identifying all the proteins in a cell at single amino acid resolution. Methods for single-cell RNA and DNA sequencing have revolutionized science and medicine. However, genetic data poorly reports on the proteins in a cell, as post-transcriptional modifications critical to cellular function (e.g., protein phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination) are not encoded in mRNA, and mRNA levels are often poorly predictive of protein levels. Despite this, robust methods for identifying and quantifying the proteins in a cell are lacking. Current mass spectrometry approaches can only identify a small fraction of all the proteins in a cell, while emerging approaches such as nanopore and real-time dynamic protein sequencing suffer from poor generalizability, throughput, and sensitivity. Researchers therefore developed a new protein sequencing method that combines the well-established technologies of Edman degradation and high-throughput DNA sequencing. Briefly, one amino acid at a time is removed from the end of each protein and barcoded with DNA that are specific to the protein molecule. The DNA barcoded amino acid derivatives are recognized by an antibody specific for that amino acid. Importantly, such antibodies can also recognize specific post-translational modifications. DNA barcodes associated with each antibody encode the identity of the amino acid, the protein it came from, and its location in the protein. DNA sequencing of these barcodes then reveals the amino acid sequence of each protein. Critically, signal amplification during DNA sequencing allows for high sensitivity. Stage of Development: Proof of concept: development of Edman degradation conditions compatible with DNA and DNA-barcoded antibodies specific for certain amino acids (including post-transcriptionally modified amino acids). Applications: Single-cell de novo protein sequencing at single-molecule resolution, High throughput database-assisted single-cell protein identification, Basic proteomics research, Diagnostics (e.g., detection of aberrant proteins such as beta-amyloid variants in Alzheimer's disease), Target discovery, Drug development (e.g., targeted protein degradation, de-ubiquitination, phosphorylation, etc). Advantages: Combines the well-established methods of Edman degradation and high throughput sequencing, Potential to sequence all the proteins in a single cell at single molecule resolution, High sensitivity, High throughput, Can identify any arbitrary protein sequence, Can detect post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, glycosylation, methylation, acetylation, etc.).",

More than 65 million individuals worldwide are estimated to have Long COVID (LC), where patients often report fatigue and other symptoms resembling myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Currently, there are no treatments or reliable diagnostic markers for fatigue. To address this gap in knowledge, Stanford researchers analyzed blood samples from individuals with fatigue syndromes, including LC, ME-CFS, and lupus patients, to successfully identify a common molecular signature of elevated oxidative stress in cells. Diagnostic analysis for fatigue can then be performed with one or more of flow cytometry, RNA-seq analysis, mass spectrometry, and systems chemistry analysis. Furthermore, the developed assays can identify specific drugs that can redress or lower oxidative stress in cells. Using this platform, Stanford researchers have successfully identified several FDA-approved drugs that can lower oxidative stress in cells.

Analyzing this cell-free RNA could enable much more thorough characterization of cancer than DNA, as RNA reports on gene expression patterns that vary widely between cancer types and can inform cancer progression. To better enable cancer diagnosis, classification, staging, and early detection, Stanford researchers therefore developed a highly sensitive and specific method for analyzing cell-free cancer RNA. Researchers extensively optimized methods for blood collection, plasma separation, cell-free RNA purification, and library preparation. They designed a custom panel of 5,546 genes to identify and classify cancer with high sensitivity.

Quantifying plasma proteins using an antibody-based or aptamer-based technology. 3.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford, led by Prof. Crystal Mackall and Prof. Jennifer R Cochran, have developed a unique approach to cancer treatment by tackling both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Adoptive T-cell therapies and agents that block the CD47/SIRP\u03b1 axis, which potentiate the antitumor properties of the adaptive and innate immune systems respectively, are two types of promising antitumor immunotherapeutics. When the researchers tried to combine them with the hope to enhance antitumor activity, they observed macrophage-mediated clearance of the adoptive T cells because the anti-CD47 agent also recognized the CD47 marker on these T cells. To overcome this challenge, these researchers engineered a variant of CD47 that allows retained 'don't eat me' signals on T-cells but ablates the therapeutic CD47 antibody binding. CAR-T or TCR-T cells expressing this CD47 variant were resistant to clearance by macrophages when combined with anti-CD47 antibody and resulted in synergistic enhancement in antitumor efficacy. By allowing for the combination of these two different immunotherapies, this work provides a path to immunotherapy that takes advantage of the immune system to deliver superior tumor-type agnostic control. Applications include tumor agnostic immunotherapies and combining anti-CD47 therapy with CAR T or TCR T cell therapies.

Currently, there is no minimally-invasive deliverable therapeutic that could be administered to stop or reverse the adverse effects of myocardial ischemia, much less the associated immune response that results in further deterioration of cardiac function and reverse remodeling of the ventricles. The Woo and Lim labs at Stanford have invented a method that leverages inhibitory immune checkpoint expressions to reduce collateral damage caused by myocardial infarctions.

When PD-L1 was delivered immediately intramyocardially following a heart attack in a rodent model, the left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly improved compared to control animals who did not receive PD-L1 treatment. PD-L1 when delivered systemically was found to have similar beneficial impact on heart function. Regardless of the dose and delivery route, the method significantly reduced left ventricular infarction size compared to controls without treatment. This invention has the potential to be a valuable tool to preserving cardiac function and significantly enhancing patient outcomes. Applications: Therapeutic, especially for cardiology; Autoimmunity; Cell signaling research tool.

Current methods by manually or automatically selecting regions of images lead to high-variance or noisy perfusion maps that may be unreliable for detecting abnormal blood flow in the brain. The invention enables reliable automated generation of perfusion maps, using a supervised deep learning algorithm, that takes 3D CT perfusion images as an input and returns time-resolved perfusion maps.

Newborn babies face a high risk of blood infections (sepsis) and gastrointestinal inflammation and injury disease (necrotizing enterocolitis 'NEC'). NEC affects 1 of 1000 premature infants with mortality rates up to 50%. Currently there is no early detection method available. The BIODESGIN NEC breath analyzer will facilitate treatment and save up to ten thousand or more lives each year through early detection. The device may be adapted to detect sepsis, a deadly late-stage infection.\n\nThe device consists of four key components - breath collection, gas analysis , data processing algorithm, and a data readout. (See Schematic.) Breath is collected via main stream (sensor embedded in tubing) or side stream (breath carried to sensors in an external box). Electrochemical sensors, infrared spectroscopy, etc. analyzes exhaled CO2, H2, CH4, and H2S gases. The algorithm relates the gas measurements and in future iterations will integrate additional medical data such as gestational age. Bedside patient monitoring will be available on the data readout screen.\n\n**Stage of Development \u2013 Proof of Concept**\nA clinical study is underway using a decentralized analysis instrument (in lab gas chromatography). The next stage of development will be bedside analysis. BIODESGIN researchers are running a prospective clinical study to confirm the biomarkers, after which they will develop a continuous monitoring prototype.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have discovered that nanobodies blocking amphiregulin (AREG) activity have the potential to impede the progression of early-stage atherosclerotic plaque lesions to advanced-stage fibroatheromas. Coronary artery disease is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the build-up of atherosclerotic plaques. In the early stages, the plaques are rich in lipids and can be treated with medication and lifestyle changes. However, as they mature beyond the lipid-rich phase, a subset of activated T-cells within the plaques expresses the pro-fibrotic protein AREG. This protein promotes smooth muscle cell proliferation and fibrosis, leading to advancement of lesions into irreversible advanced-stage plaques, such as fibroatheroma. Fibroatheroma is a major precursor to plaque rupture that could lead to life-threatening acute cardiac syndromes. To prevent the development of fibroatheromas, Stanford researchers have devised a nanobody-based platform that blocks the attachment of AREG to atherosclerotic plaque lesions, hindering disease progression. The nanobody is a bispecific protein with two immunoglobulin single variable (ISV) domains: one ISV domain binds to AREG and the other domain interferes with vascular smooth muscle cells activity. This nanobody-based platform targeting the root cause of fibroatheroma development could revolutionize treatment strategies for patients with coronary artery disease.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a new methodology called transcript-informed single-cell CRISPR sequencing (TISCC-Seq), for the direct detection and phenotyping of genetic variants in a high-throughput manner. The characterization of phenotypes of genetic variants has remained a continued challenge. Base editors can introduce single base pair mutations directly into genomes, but in addition, can also introduce a variety of different genetic variants. The newly developed single-cell technology can i) genome engineer mutations, ii) directly identify their presence among individual cells and iii) determine each mutation's transcriptional phenotype. The multiplexed approach involves CRISPR base-editors to introduce the desired mutation into a target gene and long-read sequencing of the target gene's transcript to identify the engineered mutations. Simultaneously, the transcriptome profile can be assessed. The method allows for determination of the mutations' genotype and expression phenotype at single cell resolution via integration of the long and short read data. Additionally, the technology is not restricted to CRISPR based genome engineering since it is possible to directly genotype each single-cell independent of guide RNA. The TISCC-Seq can be applied to functionally evaluate numerous cancer mutations as one example. Applications: Verification of CRISPR edits, Genetic variant specific drug development, Identification of point mutations, Cancer.

The invention enables complex control of multiple proteins. While tissue engineering holds immense promise in many therapeutic applications including transplantation and cancer immunotherapy, the immune system remains a major challenge. To address this issue, Stanford researchers have previously developed a generalized protease-responsive platform, called RELEASE, to control the secretion and display of surface proteins. Building upon it further, now they have developed a new design to attach a phospho-responsive peptide to RELEASE. Upon phosphorylation of this peptide, 14-3-3 proteins (native scaffolding proteins) will be recruited to the construct, inhibit the retention activity of RELEASE, and result in desired protein secretion. The system also allows for implementation of complex boolean logic by using a phospho-peptide that is constitutively phosphorylated (always ON), but can be removed using proteases. These protein-based circuits have advantages such as fast operation, compact delivery and robust performance compared to traditional synthetic circuits. Applications include cell transplantation, stem cell differentiation, and cancer immunotherapy. Advantages include using native signal transduction pathways, programmable control over expression of multiple proteins, modularity for local control of the immune microenvironment, increased number of available sensors to activate protein secretion, concentration-dependent sensing of a single input to control the expression of multiple outputs, and fast operation, compact delivery, and robust performance.",

While anti-PD-1 therapies have revolutionized cancer care for a number of different cancer indications, only about 20% of patients overall are responsive to these drugs. One reason for tumor resistance is a lack of T cell infiltration of the tumor.

Researchers in the Sunwoo lab have discovered such a strategy by studying the tumor-intrinsic factors leading to anti-PD-1 resistance and lack of tumor infiltration.

However, synthetically engineered cells using lentiviral systems or adeno-associated virus (AAV) often do not express transgenes to a high enough concentration and cannot persist for a long period of time. In addition, knock-in (KI) efficiency of gene fragments into a precise genomic locus requires improvement, while maintaining long-term, stable, and high expression of the desired KI fragments. The Qi lab invented a novel KI system and methodology that increases efficient KI of DNA fragments with stable, long-term genomic expressions. The two-part KI system includes a nuclease system and an engineered pseudovirus system from a lentivirus to enhance KI and gene translocation. This technology enables incorporation of large genes (7-8kB), exceeding the limitations from currently available technology. The technology also allows simultaneous KI of two genes at different genomic loci in a one-pot reaction. After KI, the cargo can be expressed even after months, showing superior expression stability. By increasing the efficiency and efficacy of gene incorporation, followed by stable gene expression, the invention can overcome the current limitations of existing methods and be a valuable tool in advancing cell-based therapies. Applications include cellular engineering and manufacturing, T cell therapy (i.e., CAR-T), iPSC engineering, stem cell therapy, and cell-based vaccines.

    "ip_description": "There are several barriers to widespread use of CAR T-cell therapy. One of them is toxicity, primarily cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity, but also on-target off-tumor toxicity. Another barrier is the lack of CAR T cell persistence, and more efficacious CAR-T cell therapies are needed especially those targeting solid tumors. The Mackall Lab at Stanford invented a novel way to harness the macrophage \u2013 CAR T cell interaction with the goal to address those two limitations: 1) Create a safety switch to quickly deplete CAR T cells in cases of toxicity, and 2) manipulate CAR T cells to enhance their persistence, improving their anti-tumor activity. The safety switch works by blocking \"don't eat me\" signals on the surface of CAR-T cells, resulting in efficient and fast elimination of CAR T cells by macrophages. Having an off-the-shelf antibody which can effectively deplete CAR T cells when they cause toxicity can be a valuable tool for immunotherapy. To obtain the opposite outcome and increase expansion and persistence exploiting the same CAR-T cell/macrophage regulatory axis, we over-express \"don't eat me\" signals on CAR T cells. This manipulation has no deleterious effect on their cytotoxic activity, but yields CAR-T cells more resistant to elimination by macrophages, leading to superior activity in models of solid and liquid tumors. Applications: CAR-T cell immunotherapies, Other T cell based therapies. Advantages: Capable of blocking or overexpressing \"don't eat me\" signals on the surface of CAR T cells depending on the purpose: Off-the-shelf antibody can be used to effectively block the signal and deplete CAR-T cells when toxic, Overexpression of the signal in CAR-T cells increase their function, persistence and efficacy.",

By discovering co-associations and patterns of cells found within a tumor from gene expression data, EcoTyper creates a detailed atlas for these cells, both cancer and immune. This invention uses CIBERSORTx, a computational technique, to analyze the RNA of individual cells taken from tumor tissue samples and to purify their distinct gene expression profiles _in silico_. The inventors first demonstrated the technology by dissecting the TME of diffuse large B cell lymphoma's (DLBCL) and then in later studies the inventors expanded the technique to profile the TMEs of 16 types of human carcinoma, characterizing multicellular communities of thousands of solid tumors at the transcriptional level. Almost all the cell types, both known and novel, were validated in a compilation of small conditional RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) tumor atlases. This information allows critical insight into the potential development of individualized immunotherapies for DLBCL and several other types of solid tumor. The potential therapeutic discoveries, clinical management improvements, and diagnostic impact of this invention can help guide personalized cancer medicine in a monumental way. Inventors analyzed patient biopsy samples from 1,300 DLBCL tumors and defined an atlas of 49 distinct transcriptional states across 13 major cell types. 94% of these states were validated from approximately 200,000 single cell transcriptomes derived from lymphomas, healthy control tonsil tissues and other tissue types.

X-ray is a broadly used imaging modality with a large market of users for many healthcare applications.

Unfortunately, to have a high enough sensitivity to observe subtle absorption/transmission differences in the sample requires enough high X-ray photon doses which in many cases is enough radiation to be damaging. The method invented here lowers the amount of radiation required by using Compton scattering through a thin carbon target with a pulsed X-ray source to produce an X-ray and an electron which are measured in coincidence. Because the electron and photon are entangled, the detection of the electron means the X-ray photon exists. This quantum concept changes the statistics of the detection allowing a reduction of the number photons required to detect the same absorption/transmission difference from 10,000 photon/pixel to 100 photons/pixel for a 1% difference (2-3 orders of magnitude improvement).

These include engineering regulatable chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) as well as identifying a group of small molecules that can modulate or inhibit TCR signaling. Immunotherapy using CAR-T cells relies on endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) signaling which is responsible for optimal T cell activation and potent antitumor or anti-infective effects. However, continuous activation of CAR T cells can result in a dysfunctional state called \"T cell exhaustion\", reducing the overall effectiveness of therapy. To address this overstimulation problem, the inventors genetically engineered a regulatable CAR by attaching a protein domain that allows for control over CAR surface expression via addition of an FDA-approved small molecule drug. This system is designed such that CAR T cells can undergo temporary periods of rest during which the CAR T cell ceases to signal, thus mitigating T cell exhaustion and restoring therapeutic efficacy. In addition, the inventors showed that certain small molecules that inhibit protein kinases can also address the overstimulation problem through transient inhibition of TCR signaling. Both inventions have applications in basic research or immunotherapy for infectious disease or cancer.\n\nThe inventors have established an animal model of regulating CAR surface expression and demonstrated proof-of-concept for the engineered regulatable CAR system _in vitro_ and _in vivo_:\n\n*   _In vitro_ - Transient rest (i.e., removing the engineered chimeric antigen receptors from the cell surface for 72-96 hours) can reinvigorate T cells following exhaustion.

Culturing CAR T cells in the absence of the small molecule drug in order to \"hide\" surface CAR mitigates CAR tonic signaling/exhaustion and improves in vivo efficacy.\n\nThe inventors also used a known, FDA-approved drug to demonstrate the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on reversing T cell exhaustion and augmenting T cell function in vivo.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have discovered that bispecific antibodies can selectively bind cancer cells and block the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 'don't eat me signal' to efficiently clear tumors with negligible toxicity. Developing bispecific antibodies to target cancer cells for phagocytosis can be an innovative method to help eliminate tumors and treat various cancers, such as lymphoma and leukemia.\n\nThe interaction between CD47 and SIRP\u03b1 transmits a 'don't eat me signal' that inhibits phagocytosis as a mechanism for the immune system to identify self from non-self. Cancer cells commonly overexpress CD47 to take advantage of this signal and avoid elimination by phagocytosis. Efforts to block CD47 using recombinant variants of SIRP\u03b1 have been explored as a therapeutic approach to promote the elimination of tumor cells. However, CD47 expression on normal cells serves as an 'antigen sink,' which reduces the efficacy of CD47 blockade and potentially leads to toxicity due to their phagocytosis. Previous studies have shown that therapeutic antibodies that bind tumor antigens to induce phagocytosis are synergistic with CD47 blockage, suggesting that a bifunctional protein that performs these two functions can be a viable option for specifically and efficiently inducing phagocytosis of cancer cells.\n\nBispecific antibodies designed by the Stanford researchers have low affinity for CD47, rendering them unable to bind normal cells expressing CD47 alone, and high affinity for the tumor antigen CD20, demonstrating selective binding to CD20/CD47 dual antigen-expressing tumor cells. Importantly, the treatment using these bispecific antibodies in mice transplanted or transfused with cancer cells resulted in a significant extension of their survival and depleted target cells in non-human primates with no observed toxicity. Consequently, bispecific antibodies have the potential to improve cancer treatments by targeting tumor cells for phagocytic elimination in patients.\n\nApplications:\n- Development of bispecific antibodies to treat cancer\n- Elimination of cancer cells in lymphoma and leukemia\n- Increasing the efficacy of CD47 blockage by targeting cancer cells for phagocytosis\n\nAdvantages:\n- Synergizes CD47 blockade with binding to tumor antigens and induction of phagocytosis\n- Versatile method that can accommodate the targeting of a plethora of tumor antigens\n- Function is confined to a single, bispecific antibody which simplifies formulations",

The team designed and validated a multiplex allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) genotyping assay to detect three EBV BALF2 variants. As compared to other current assays, this assay is single-reaction, cost-effective, more accurate, and can also provide important genotyping information. It has been through rigorous analytical/clinical validation. Commercial application can be in the form of a qPCR kit (analyte-specific reagents or complete kit), which could be purchased by laboratories that offer plasma-based NPC screening. Applications include early cancer detection especially in higher-risk East/Southeast Asian populations, flexibility for serial or once-lifetime screening triage, and commercial application in the form of a qPCR kit.

Currently, state-of-the-art technologies in this field rely heavily on the expertise of interventional radiologists who use catheters and guidewires to treat patients with various diseases, such as stroke, deep vein thrombosis, endovascular coiling, and transcatheter aortic valve replacement. However, these procedures often encounter challenges when navigating through complex arterial tortuosity in elderly patients, leading to increased procedure time and technical failures. Furthermore, patients may need to be transferred to specialized hospitals where interventional surgeons are available to perform these intricate procedures.\n\nThe magnetic spinner presents an ingenious solution to address these pressing challenges. By harnessing magnets to move freely inside blood vessels, this device offers a multitude of benefits. Firstly, it enhances navigation within multi-branched blood vessels, reducing procedure time and improving success rates. The device's spinning-enabled propelling enables smooth movement through tortuous paths, making it ideal for elderly patients with complex vascular anatomy. Additionally, the magnetic spinner can be operated remotely, potentially eliminating the need for patient transfer to specialized hospitals. This capability significantly enhances accessibility to high-quality interventional procedures, especially in remote or underserved areas, and ensures patients receive timely and effective treatment.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Drug delivery\n*   Robotic interventional surgery\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   Minimally invasive\n*   Remote operation\n*   Improved patient outcomes",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have identified the use of the drug verteporfin to treat or reduce the risk of developing fibrosis after ocular procedures or ocular injury. Of interest is corneal injury, for example after refractive surgery or crosslinking, e.g. LASIK and PRK, and also after corneal infections and ulcers, such as bacterial, viral and fungal infections of the cornea. For example, burns and injury to the cornea can lead to permanent scarring of the cornea and loss of vision. In the case of burns and severe injuries, preserving vision requires preventing fibrosis during the healing process, and facilitating transparent, \"scarless\" tissue regeneration. Currently, there are no FDA approved treatments that addresses the main cause of corneal blindness after injury, which is the formation of fibrotic scars that degrade or completely block vision. A topical therapy that can blunt or eliminate the formation of scars may enable patients to avoid an invasive surgery such as a corneal transplant to remove the scar. Verteporfin, a benzoporphyrin derivative, was FDA approved more than two decades ago as an intravenous injection with photodynamic therapy to treat choroidal neovascularization in the eye, and has been shown to be safe for use with that indication. The drug has been shown to prevent fibrosis in several human organs including the lung, skin, liver and kidney and can be dosed safely in the skin in previous animal studies with minimal side effects. Researchers have shown that a single dose of verteporfin compounded in a carrier can prevent scar formation after corneal injury.\n\nStage of Development\n-Preclinical animal models\n\nApplications\n- Treating or reducing the risk of fibrosis after corneal injury, glaucoma surgery, or after other ocular procedures and injuries\n\nAdvantages\n- Unmet need for an improved approach to modulate wound healing after ocular injury or surgery\n- Verteporfin was approved by FDA in 2000 for unrelated mechanism of action and mode of administration for use in ophthalmology",

This binder can be conjugated to a variety of payloads, including an anti-immune checkpoint protein antibody for more selective immune checkpoint blockade.\n\nImmune checkpoint proteins expressed on the surface of immune cells inhibit their activity and prevent excessive immune responses. In cancer, the overactivation of these proteins can prevent the immune system from killing cancer cells. Antibodies that re-activate the immune system by blocking checkpoint proteins (\"checkpoint blockade\") can therefore treat a wide variety of cancers. However, these drugs can cause dangerous side effects by also activating healthy immune cells, causing the immune system to attack both cancer and healthy tissues.\n\nStanford researchers therefore invented a new class of checkpoint inhibitors that selectively act on immune cells involved in cancer. These molecules comprise a novel binder for CD206, a marker expressed on tumor-associated macrophages (\"TAMs,\" immune cells that contribute to cancer progression) conjugated to an antibody that binds but does not inhibit a checkpoint protein. When this molecule binds to a TAM, the cell internalizes and destroys the immune checkpoint proteins on its surface, allowing it to kill cancer cells. These molecules can also destroy soluble immune cell signaling proteins such as cytokines involved in cancer progression. The CD206 binder can also be conjugated to other payloads, such as siRNA, cytotoxic drugs, or imaging agents.\n\n**Stage of Development**\n_In vitro_: selective binding to TAMs and depletion of immune checkpoint proteins and cytokines in macrophage cell lines\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Targeted cancer immunotherapy\n*   Antibodies for imaging tumor-associated macrophages\n*   siRNA conjugates for delivery to tumor-associated macrophages\n*   ADCs for delivery of cytotoxic drugs to tumor-associated macrophages\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   Better binding and easier to synthesize than prior, polymeric CD206 binders\n*   CD206 binder can be conjugated to a variety of payloads\n*   More selective and less toxic than traditional checkpoint inhibitors\n*   Platform technology for targeted cancer immunotherapy\n*   Degradation of both cell-surface (i.e., ICAM-1) and soluble (i.e., IL-4) proteins involved in cancer progression\n*   More selective and easier to synthesize than prior tumor-associated macrophage binders",

    "ip_description": "The DeSimone Research Group at Stanford University developed a method for fabricating 3D pyrolytic carbon structures from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) generated by a scalable Vat Polymerization 3D-printing continuous liquid interface production (CLIP) process. PAN is popular for generating conductive high-strength carbon fibers commonly used in lightweight structural applications including battery systems for sustainable energy storage. However, because PAN is insoluble in its own AN monomer, it precipitates to form powder during VP 3D printing making it impossible to print. In response, the DeSimone Research Group developed this multi-step fabrication method for producing 3D carbon structures from PAN (See **Figure** below):\n\n*   A sacrificial crosslinked gel lattice scaffold is 3D CLIP printed.\n*   The gel scaffold is infused with acrylonitrile monomers and a thermal initiator.\n*   The acrylonitrile polymerizes inside the gel scaffold forming an interpenetrating polymer network.\n*   Finally, the PAN-infused gel lattice structure is thermally treated (e.g. an oxidative pre-treatment, isothermal holds, and/or pyrolysis) that converts the PAN to 3D pyrolytic carbon.\n\nThe method incorporates PAN into 3D-printed high-resolution lattice structures via CLIP which following pyrolysis yields 3D lightweight electrode; This VP 3D-printing and gel infusion method can be used to pioneer the incorporation of other linear polymers, like polyethylene and polyimides, into high-resolution lattice structures.\n\nResearchers at the Lu Group, UC Merced, have pioneered a method to create 3D pyrolytic carbon with an exceptionally high surface area, boosted by the inclusion of 1D carbon nanostructures. This method involves incorporating various catalysts either on the surface or within 3D printed polymers. The process enhances impingement through pressure, temperature, or evaporation-assisted techniques.\n\nThere are **five** roles these catalyst systems will fulfill:\n\n1.  Promoting the formation of graphitic carbon precursor\n2.  Coordination bonding to increase char yield\n3.  Graphitization\n4.  Carbon metal composite framework to prevent severe shrinkage during polymer pyrolysis, and enhance the mechanical integrity and electrical conductivity.\n5.  The growth of 1D carbon nanostructures to enhance the electrical conductivity and surface area of the pyrolytic carbon.\n\nBelow is a process in **steps**:\n\n*   **Catalyst and Biomass Precursor Infusion**: The 3D printed template is immersed in a solution containing catalysts and biomass (such as sugar). During controlled solvent evaporation under elevated temperatures, the dehydrated biomass derivatives react with unreacted vinyl groups in the resin, forming carbon.\n*   **Primary Structure Formation**: The polymer template infused with catalyst undergoes pyrolysis under an inert atmosphere, solidifying the structure.\n*   **Secondary Structure Growth**: 1D carbon nanostructures are grown by introducing a gaseous carbon precursor, further increasing surface area and conductivity.\n*   **Functionalization (Tertiary Structure)**: Electrografting tertiary species onto the secondary structure imbues the final product with application-specific functionalities.\n\n**Stage of Development \u2013 Proof of Concept**\nThe Lu and DeSimone Research Groups are optimizing the process based on detailed electrochemical, mechanical, and surface topology characterization analyses to achieve optimal conductivity, char yield, and mechanical properties.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   **Batteries for grid energy storage and EVs** - 3D Printed, PAN-based pyrolytic carbon lattice structures for redox flow and EV batteries.\n*   **CO2 recapture** - pyrolytic carbon lattice electrocatalysis for high-throughput reactions such as the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction and other reactions requiring high volumetric-density electrochemically active surface area and to facilitate mass transport.\n*   Bio and environmental sensing.\n*   Chemical production via electrification.\n*   Support for electrocatalysis to enable hydrogen economy.\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   The secondary and tertiary structures enable the extremely high volumetric chemical reaction hitherto unattainable.\n*   **First in class** fabrication of acrylonitrile swelled and polymerized in a 3D-printed gel structure followed by pyrolysis to create revolutionary 3D lattice carbon structures.\n*   **Excellent electrical** conductivity, strong **chemical** stability, and excellent **mechanical properties**.\n*   **Quick, high resolution, scalable Vat Polymerization 3D-printing** via CLIP.\n*   One step pyrolysis process combining graphitization and secondary carbon nanostructure growth.\n*   The multifunctionality of the catalysts is the key for highly electrically conductive, mechanically robust, 3D structures that offer easily accessible, extremely large surface areas.\n*   Green fabrication through minimal chemical usage when biomass is used and hierarchical carbon nanostructure is formed in situ.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed an inducible and programmable CRISPR-mediated transcript organization (CRISPR-TO) method for repositioning RNAs to various desired subcellular compartments. Spatial RNA transcriptomics, including subcellular mRNA localization, is a core mechanism for spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis. For example, neurons with large axons tend to spatially localize key mRNAs to the tip of axons to coordinate axon guidance and growth cone development. Mounting evidence has begun to correlate the dysregulation of mRNA localization to an increasing number of diseases, in particular neurological diseases. However, despite decades of effort, the mechanistic and functional importance of RNA spatial localization has only been explored for a few key examples, largely due to a lack of efficient and programmable approaches that allow for the manipulation of any endogenous RNA localization in cells. The inventors have developed methods of localizing RNA in a cell in which a localization polypeptide and RNA carrier polypeptide form an intracellular molecular transport dimerization pair. The method is both inducible, and can deliver a guide RNA to various subcellular locations within a cell. Applications include using CRISPR-TO to efficiently manipulate the spatial localization of repetitive reporter mRNAs, localization of GAPDH mRNAs or GCN4 reporter mRNAs to p-bodies, stress granules, minus ends of microtubules, plus ends of microtubules, tellers and nuclear stress bodies in HeLa cells, localization of endogenous mRNAs to the projections of primary neurons, the recruitment of mRNA to the terminals of neuronal projections in primary mouse hippocampal neurons, and localization of OMM mRNA to promote the import of translated proteins into mitochondria.

Commensal microbiota reside primarily at barrier sites, such as the gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract and skin, where they functionally tune the innate and adaptive immune systems. Immune tolerance to these microbes must be established at each of these contact sites. Treg cells play a major role in establishing and maintaining immune homeostasis in peripheral tissues, particularly at barrier sites where they stably reside. In contrast, T effector cells generally amplify pro-inflammatory responses in an antigen-specific manner. The authors have previously developed novel methods for stimulating and expanding antigen-specific Tregs and T effector cells with TCRs specific for a specific host antigen of interest. The inventors have devised a method to present antigens linked to commensal bacterial surface proteins which results in a surprisingly high immune response triggered when the bacterial are applied to an epithelial surface of a mammal. This method comprises the expression of an extracellular bacterial protein selected from the group consisting of Accumulation-associated protein (Aap), peptidoglycan, an M protein, Lysing Motif (LysM)-containing protein and a peptidoglycan-binding protein, or a fragment linked to a heterologous antigenic molecule or immunomodulatory molecule. Applications include linkage of an antigen molecule on any bacterial surface protein or other bacterial wall molecule, attachment of antigens to bacterial surface proteins, fusion of an extracellular protein with a first affinity agent, click chemistry compatibility that can link the antigenic molecule to a polypeptide on the bacterial surface using an alkyne or azide moiety, coating bacteria non-specifically on their surface with an antigenic or immunomodulatory molecule, and use of non-protein molecules as antigenic molecules, i.e. lipids or polysaccharides.

Urine is assayed alongside blood in medicine, however current clinical diagnostic tests exploit only a minor fraction of its biomolecular repertoire, thereby foregoing high-resolution insights into human health and disease. For instance, current state-of-the-art liquid biopsies are largely focused on nucleic acids in blood plasma. Urine is the ultra-filtrate of blood; some molecules that are present at very low levels in the blood are hyper-concentrated in urine, offering an orthogonal readout to a plasma liquid biopsy. Additionally, urine provides a direct, noninvasive window into the health and functioning of cell types and tissues with low representation in blood. Therefore, the replacement or use of a urine liquid biopsy relative to current clinical readouts on urine (e.g., albumin, urine dipstick, serum creatinine, etc.) may provide a more direct readout into underlying disease. The inventors have developed methods of detecting cell-free RNA (cfRNA) as well as metabolites in urine samples. This method can be applied as a direct readout for disease, for example as a method of evaluating kidney function, prostate function, or bladder function in a human. Applications include characterization of the urine transcriptomic landscape, urine liquid biopsies exhibiting distinct cell types of origin from the plasma cell-free RNA transcriptome, and untargeted metabolomics for a functional readout of the urinary metabolic landscape. Advantages include the ability to non-invasively resolve bladder urothelial, renal and prostate epithelia at cell type resolution, and the fact that while RNA offers insights into the underlying changes in gene expression, metabolomics provides a functional readout.",

In the US alone, more than 12 million red-cell units are consumed annually. However, the availability is contingent on donor material, resulting in supply constraints and safety concerns. Globally, shortages pose a significant healthcare challenge, expected to worsen with aging populations and diminishing donor numbers. To address these growing medical needs, ex vivo manufacture of red blood cells (RBCs) from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) producer lines emerges as a renewable and scalable solution that offer potential benefits compared to donor blood, including a lower risk of infectious disease transmission, streamlined production, product uniformity, and ability to source or genetically engineer antigen-negative cells. However, this approach remains extremely costly, owing in large part to purified, clinical-grade recombinant cytokines required to stimulate producer cells for expansion and differentiation into erythroid cells. Because erythropoietin (EPO) signaling through the EPO receptor (EPOR) is indispensable to RBC development, of all components in erythroid-promoting media, EPO is by far the most costly.\n\nMethods: We used the latest synthetic biology tools and genome engineering technologies to de-couple EPOR signaling from the EPO cytokine. Specifically, we devised a series of FKBP-EPOR chimeras that exchanged the requirement for native EPO ligand with an exogenous, orthogonal rapalog small molecule (SM) which we termed inducible EPORs (iEPORs). These were site-specifically inserted in vitro into primary human hematopoietic cells (HSCs) via CRISPR/AAV-mediated genome editing at various HSC and RBC-relevant loci (CCR5 with the PGK and SFFV promoters, EPOR, and HBA1). Using flow cytometry and ddPCR-based assays, we determined the fidelity (i.e., responsivity to SM) and potency (ability to drive differentiation from a stem cell state towards the erythroid lineage) of various iEPOR constructs (different signal peptides and extracellular and intracellular domain modifications) as well as the impact of inserting these chimeras at the aforementioned loci.\n\nResults & Discussion: We first optimized iEPOR constructs through a highly effective signal peptide present on IL6 and inclusion of the naturally occurring intracellular domain truncation known to enhance erythropoiesis. Together, these modifications allowed us to drive HSCs to 100% differentiation into RBCs in the presence of the iEPOR-dimerizing small molecule. However, we also observed 26.2% differentiation in the absence of any endogenous or exogenous erythroid-biasing ligand. To increase the fidelity of our iEPOR, we integrated our iEPOR at the CCR5 locus and drove expression using the PGK promoter to ablate ligand-independent differentiation (**Figure 1A**). This identical HSC response to iEPOR in the presence of our small molecule versus native HSC in the presence of EPO was corroborated not only by flow cytometry-based markers of erythroid differentiation but also via HPLC-based assessment of hemoglobin A and F production. iEPOR-integrated HSCs differentiated as described clustered with natively differentiated HSCs vs undifferentiated HSCs by PCA covariance plots and differential gene expression heatmaps (**Figure 1B**). We observed effectively identical counts of hemoglobin RNA supporting our HPLC findings. Finally, we integrated our optimized iEPOR construct into an iPSC line and devised a consolidated, differentiation strategy from induced pluripotent stem cells to HSCs and, ultimately, RBCs (**Figure 1C**). Together, this proves our approach serves an ex vivo, EPO-independent RBC production strategy that closely mimics native EPOR signaling by surface biomarkers, relevant protein output, and transcriptional profile. By our calculation, 1nM of dimerizer is approximately 500-fold less costly than 3U/mL of EPO cytokine. This would therefore reduce the cost of EPO cytokine required to generate a single unit of RBCs from $2,760 to approximately $6. Given that dependence on costly cytokines is a common barrier to production of cell-based therapeutics, in the future we believe the strategies defined in this work may enable scalable and renewable ex vivo production of a wide variety of clinically relevant cell types including platelets, neutrophils, T cells.\n\nApplications:\n- Hemoglobinopathies\n\nAdvantages:\n- Greater efficacy by inducing bias in transplanted HSC to yield higher RBC production.\n- Lower toxic and mutagenic regimens are required to stimulate high RBC production.\n- Easy integration into current treatment workflow.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford Medicine's Ji Research Group has developed a simple, quantitative method for detecting and characterizing gene fusions that uses DNA rather than RNA as analyte. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), certain chromosomal translocations correlate with a good prognosis, while some deletions or duplications are linked to an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. The ability to quickly determine specific cancer mutations provides a clinical advantage and opportunity for precise delivery of targeted therapies. However, detecting cancer gene fusion is very difficult with current methods. The Ji Research Group overcomes the associated issues by physically isolating target gene fusion from non-targets and from the wild-type, non-rearranged genes. Their method targets a specific locus prone to rearrangement via an initial PCR based prescreen, and multiplexes for different targets specific to a given cancer, which greatly increases the efficiency of the process. The target sites are excised with CRISPR edits, and the high molecular weight DNA targets are isolated. A simple quantitative PCR assay provides an initial, high sensitivity detection that is then followed by long read nanopore sequencing for more extensive sequence characterization of the gene mutation. This diagnostic method identifies and characterizes specific genomic aberrations in cancer types that can be used to more accurately provide diagnoses, prognoses, and targeted therapies. Stage of Development \u2013 Proof of Concept: Proof of concept studies performed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ongoing research will focus on applying the method to clinical uses and a variety of cancers. Applications: Cancer diagnostics, prognostics, and targeted therapies. Advantages: Stable, high-resolution data pinpointing of fused genes, breakpoints and gene variant information. Simple workflow, easy to implement for research and diagnostic labs.

Poor electronic conductivity of electro-deposited MnO2 is a key critical problem that limits the maximum specific areal loading, producing only a thin layer of MnO2 with low areal loading (around 0.005~0.05 mAh cm-2) during the charge/discharge cycle. Stanford researchers discovered, by tuning the temperature, the deposited phase of MnO2 can be manipulated from -?-MnO2 with low conductivity to ?-MnO2 with 2 orders of magnitude increase in conductivity. Applications include potential use for manganese-hydrogen and manganese-zinc aqueous batteries in grid-scale energy storage. Advantages include being more efficient, scalable, lower overall cost for manganese-based batteries, and safer than fire-risk lithium-ion batteries.

HCC is one of the most common cancers and has a dismal prognosis as currently available medical treatment only improves survival by a few months. Current guidelines only focus on screening patients for HCC with cirrhotic stage liver disease. However, that 30-40% of all NASH-related HCCs occur in non-cirrhotic livers. These patients often present at a late stage when they are not eligible for liver transplant, and other treatment modalities are very limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new screening strategies and develop new biomarkers to improve survival of these patients.\n\nInventors at Stanford have developed an animal model with NASH and hydrodynamically-induced HCC. Using genetic approaches and inhibitors of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and crosslink inhibitors, inventors discovered that liver AGEs promoted HCC in vivo by increasing tissue viscoelasticity. Viscoelasticity could be modulated by targeting AGE deposition and collagen crosslinking. Higher viscoelasticity promoted HCC cell spread and migration in a novel 3D hydrogel model with high viscoelasticity. Thus, viscoelasticity measurements can be used as a screening and diagnostic tool in the pre-cirrhotic NASH population.\n\n**Stage of Development**\nProof of Concept\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Mouse model for human NASH/HCC research\n*   Screening platform for potential drugs, drug targets, and biomarkers\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   New technology to assess tissue viscoelasticity\n*   Novel screening algorithm for NASH population\n\nPublications\n------------\n\n*   Oral presentation, AASLD 2022; Matrix Biology (ASIP), 2023\n*   Abstract presentation, EASL Liver Cancer Summit, 2024;\n*   Fan, W., Adebowale, K., V\u00e1ncza, L. et al.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have created a de novo protein design platform that designs binding proteins that specifically target antigens in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Designing proteins capable of specific targeting of antigens can be transformative and enhance CAR-T treatments. MHCs are protein molecules that bind pathogen-associated or damage-associated molecular patterns and display them on the surface of cells for recognition by the immune system. T cell receptors (TCRs) have evolved to recognize the peptide identities on the MHC-peptide complexes via interaction with both the antigenic peptide and the MHC. There have been significant efforts to engineer TCRs to allow improved recognition and destruction of virus-infected cells or cancer. However, TCR engineering remains a challenge due to its structural complexity. The creation of a non-TCR protein platform to design functional mimetics of TCRs that recognize the MHC-peptide complexes can overcome the challenges associated with TCR engineering. Proteins that specifically bind to an MHC-peptide complex of interest are designed using computer-based protein engineering and high throughput screening assays. The designed binding protein, or TRACeR, is simpler in structure than TCRs, and comprises an antigenic peptide recognition element and an MHC recognition element. Selected binders are screened for binding strength against thymic epithelial cells to minimize cross-reactivity with self-MHC-peptides. Importantly, TRACeRs have been tested in CAR-T cells and have positive killing results. Consequently, TRACeRs have the potential to drastically improve CAR-T therapy efficacy and transform the CAR-T field by facilitating the design of binding proteins that specifically target relevant antigens.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have developed a novel method to accelerate the development of T cell target probes known as Rapid Identification of Peptide-ligands from Protein Antigen (RIPPA). RIPPA aims to streamline the laborious processes involved in isolating relevant peptide/MHC-II characteristics necessary for T cell epitope discovery both experimentally and computationally. The specificity of T cell responses relies on the recognition of unique peptides presented by MHC-II molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. However, the heterogeneity of MHC-II alleles and labor-intensive purification process across currently employed methods, results in lengthy screening periods often ranging between 4-6 months. RIPPA enables a much larger panel of MHC-II alleles to be screened within a short time frame and in a cost-efficient manner. By genetically modifying an array of yeast cell clones to express a specific MHC-II allele in their native-like format, RIPPA quickly screens pathogenic peptides for their binding to tens to hundreds of MHC-II alleles over the span of a month. Characterization of relevant peptide/MHC-II characteristics will guide T cell research and therapeutic endeavors involving T cell-dependent immunity. Furthermore, RIPPA's ability to generate a vast amount of peptide/MHC-II binding data will propel computational approaches for T cell epitope discovery. Applications include T cell dependent therapies (e.g. vaccines and other immunotherapies), T cell dependent diagnostics (e.g. T cell staining), and structural biology research (e.g. crystallization studies). Advantages of RIPPA include being faster by eliminating lengthy repeated steps, cheaper by eliminating costly labor-intensive steps, and having a larger data generation capability.",

    "ip_description": "?-thalassemia is a devastating blood disorder caused by mutations in the HBB gene encoding ?-globin, where treatment involves lifelong, costly management of the resulting lack of hemoglobin and hemolytic anemia. In addition to the shortage of ?-globin, the accumulation of ?-globin is also a significant contributor to disease pathology, driven by expression from two highly homologous genes, HBA1 and HBA2. Stanford researchers have optimized a CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing technique to replace one of the two genes encoding ?-globin with a functional version of HBB. Despite the similarity of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes, the inventors have developed highly selective CRISPR guide sequences that can specifically knock-in the HBB gene into the HBA1 locus, leaving the HBA2 gene intact. The resulting gene expression profile produces a normalized ratio of ?-globin and ?-globin to restore functional hemoglobin. Researchers demonstrate that hematopoietic stem cells can be edited efficiently to replace HBA1 with HBB, and successfully engraft and reconstitute in a mouse model to restore hemoglobin levels. Due to the redundancy of alpha-globin genes and the fact that site-specific integration at the HBA1 locus achieves a red blood cell-specific expression profile of custom transgenes, this technology has broad clinical application outside of thalassemia. Ongoing Research: Researchers find that in patient-derived cells they were able to: 1) efficiently edit HSPCs; 2) normalize the ratio of beta-globin:alpha-globin; 3) restore functional hemoglobin; and 4) successfully engraft edited cells into mice. Applications: Treatment of alpha and beta thalassemia, Treatment of monogenic blood disorders, Harnessing red blood cells as a therapeutic delivery vehicle via integration of a therapeutic gene into the HBA1 locus.

There is a growing interest in fabricating complex micro and nanoscale 3D structures for various clinical and research applications. One of the most well-established techniques for nanoscale 3D fabrication is two-photon polymerization (2PP). However, 2PP is slow and expensive, because it uses high-powered lasers that allow for only monovoxel printing per light source. Researchers at Stanford have proposed TTA-UC, which uses lower power sources, as an alternative to 2PP. Materials involved in this process contain a sensitizer-annihilator pair, a photoinitiator, and monomers. The sensitizer absorbs lower energy photons to make the annihilator emits higher-energy photons. The photoinitiator then triggers the assembly of the monomers, or polymerization by absorbing the upconverted photons. The researchers have identified a resin with an ideal ratio of appropriate components for TTA-UC. They then demonstrated that TTA-UC can be parallelized by incorporating a digital micromirror device to project millions of voxels simultaneously. Additionally, they developed algorithm that makes grayscale and sparser versions of the intended design to prevent unintended polymerization in neighboring pixels, allowing them to print more complex 3D structures. Applications include fabrication of nanotools in the fields of plasmonics, nanophotonics, microoptics, nanooptics, robotics, biomedicine, and extended reality.

Multiplexing single cell technologies affords researchers the ability to characterize cell states and identify gene regulatory programs across various cell types. The application of sequencing-based surface protein quantification using barcoded antibodies to intracellular or nuclear protein targets has been challenging. Nuclear targets are particularly challenging due to high levels of background oligo-antibody staining, potentially driven by the conjugated single stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligo. However, quantification of nuclear transcription factors, the drivers of gene regulation, would enable critical understanding of gene regulatory processes. For this reason, several approaches to reduce non-specific staining include saturating cells with single stranded nucleic acids or other charged polymers to block non-specific binding to ssDNA oligos. The inventors have developed methods quantify intracellular and nuclear targets within a single cell using antibodies conjugated to barcoded oligonucleotides. The inventors reduced non-specific oligo-antibody staining by coating the conjugated ssDNA oligo with single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs). The inventors demonstrate the utility of this technology in profiling CD4 memory T cells by combining SSB-coated oligo-antibodies in nuclear protein quantification with ATAC-seq and RNA-seq (NEAT-seq). Applications include directly measuring single cell protein levels of cytoplasmic or nuclear targets, like transcription factors, with improved signal over background, and oligo-antibody staining in combination with other single cell genomic measurements (e.g., ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, Hi-C, etc.) or perturbating screening for comprehensive cell profiling.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have created software, referred to as Symbolica, for automating model development for multiscale systems that can accelerate the generation of multi-physical models by 10^5 times what can be completed by hand. Symbolica has the potential to democratize powerful model development strategies in a similar manner to how computational physics software offer communal access to the rapid deployment of numerical methods.\n\nWhile multiscale models significantly increase computational efficiency (i.e., reduce simulation times from days or weeks to minutes or hours) and accurately model physical processes across multiple scales, their utilization and perceived relevance are commonly narrowed to idealized systems of low complexity. This is due to the rigorous mathematical derivations necessary to generate such models, which become analytically intractable for systems of realistic complexities and must be carried out by-hand. As such, significant time (i.e., months to years, even for field experts) and specialized expertise in theoretical development (i.e., mathematical formulation and field knowledge) are required to obtain multiscale models, making them infeasible for practitioners to employ in application.\n\nSymbolica accelerates multiscale model development by using symbolic computation to automatically carry out analytical manipulations exactly as an applied mathematician would do by-hand. By doing so, rigorous multiscale models can be generated in a feasible amount of time (i.e., seconds or minutes as opposed to months or years). This is a similar speed up to how early computers accelerated computations that were done by hand and has no limitations in analytical tractability. and no need for specialized expertise in theoretical development. While the capabilities of Symbolica have been demonstrated for applications related to thermal runaway in battery packs and reactive transport in porous media (see publications), its generality allows its application to a wide variety of multiscale, multi-physical systems. In this sense, Symbolica democratizes powerful model development strategies, as there is no need for specialized expertise, and has the potential to transform access to multiscale modeling.\n\nApplications:\n- Apply Symbolica as a model generation/selection tool.\n- Produce a software for automating rigorous mathematical model development.\n- Produce a software for engineering design.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Automatic computations for theoretical model development\n- Speed up of multiscale model development by several fold\n- No need for specialized expertise",

After proving that GPR84 is significantly upregulated in both human cells/tissues (in the context of inflammation) and mouse models of neuroinflammatory diseases, they developed PET tracers that bind with high specificity to this target. Tracking the innate immune system is vital when developing new therapies for a range of diseases, including cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and neurodegenerative diseases, to enable patient stratification and real-time monitoring of therapeutic response. In particular within the central nervous system this has been challenging due to the lack of methods to detect and quantify inflammation in the brain with high specificity in a non-invasive manner. This new approach developed by researchers at Stanford, involving PET tracers targeting GPR84, could be used to more accurately diagnose and stage neurological diseases, and other inflammatory conditions, in addition to aiding in the development of better therapies for diseases such as, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

This design offers versatility and aims to address the common issue of bleeding in aortic procedures, providing reinforced suture areas to mitigate concerns about bleeding around the anastomosis line. The device is applicable for aortic root or aortic arch anastomosis, allowing for a double-layered, reinforced anastomosis with the added benefit of the supplementary skirt for enhanced suture line reinforcement.

Conventional procedures often result in para-valvular leaks due to the difficulty in removing all calcification, leading to poor patient outcomes. The new valve design features a large detachable skirt proximal to the sewing cuff, allowing an additional layer of graft material to be sewn onto the left atrial tissue, ensuring a secure seal and eliminating the risk of potential para-valvular leaks. The design accommodates patients without severe MAC by allowing the skirt to be detached.

The CAD renderings show only a mechanical valve design. However, the same concept and design can be applied to biologic valves, and even for aortic positions for patients. Applications include mechanical mitral valve, biologic mitral valve, and aortic positions for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis due to calcification.

The device consists of a straight Dacron graft with a rigid sewing ring for autograft proximal anastomosis, and it includes reference markings for precise commissure suspension. To accommodate different surgical preferences, circular markings on the graft can be utilized for direct anastomosis or left intact for a 3-layered anastomosis. The inclusion technique aims to support the autograft and prevent late dilation but may be challenging to perform. Surgeons face potential issues such as distorted neo-annulus during autograft implantation and bleeding complications during coronary button anastomosis, especially with the 3-layered technique, which may result in pressure build-up and potential blood flow occlusion. This change to the inclusion technique was developed to support the autograft and prevent this late autograft dilation.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have proposed that coating surgical sutures with mechanotransduction inhibitors may reduce scarring of the tissue. When the skin or other tissues are wounded, the body initiates a healing process. While shallow wounds may heal without a scar, injuries involving thicker tissues, such as the dermis or fascia, often lead to visible scars characterized by abnormal color, contour, rugosity, and breaking strength. Over time, scars may improve in appearance and breaking strength as collagen structures remodel and blood vessels form. However, these characteristics will never fully match those of normal (unwounded) skin, and certain functional elements like hair follicles and sweat glands do not regenerate, resulting in permanent functional losses. Currently, there is no therapeutic strategy to either prevent or reverse scarring. Upon learning that the primary pathway responsible for scar formation is mechanotransduction, Stanford researchers studied the impact of mechanotransduction inhibitors on fibrosis. Inhibitors targeting proteins such as Focal Adhesion Kinase, Yes Associated Protein, Piezo1 and Piezo2 effectively reduced scarring, restoring both appearance and full function. Surgical sutures, used to close open tissues or attach medical devices, present a promising avenue for scar prevention. Coating sutures with any or combinations of the mechanotransduction inhibitors could reduce future scarring. Also, these sutures could be used in scar revision surgeries to reverse scarring. Applications include skin wounds (ex. Incisional wounds or burns), postpartum recovery, surgeries involving joining tissues, medical device implant, laparotomy surgery, scar revision surgery, organ fibrosis, and pathological skin scarring conditions (Dupuytren's disease, fibrotic dermal scarring, hypertrophic scarring, keloid scarring, corneal and other ocular tissue scarring). Advantages include being capable of both preventing and reversing scarring, can be combined with active agents (antimicrobial, antibiotic, or antiseptic) to improve the prognosis, and a simple fabrication process, making it scalable.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed an innovative replacement of bipolar membrane (BPM) electrodialysis, called bipolar electrode (BPE) to split water into separate streams of protons and hydroxide ions more efficiently and cost effectively. The use of acid and base reagents in industrial chemical processes often leads to the production of large amounts of salt by product. Instead of treating the salt as waste, electrochemical technology can be employed to regenerate acid and base from the salt and water. Current state of the art technology, bipolar membrane (BPM) electrodialysis, is not very efficient or durable for splitting water into protons and hydroxide. To address this issue, Stanford researcher have invented the bipolar electrode (BPE) comprising two catalyst layers surrounding a gas-transporting layer. One catalyst generates a gaseous product (e.g., hydrogen), transported to the other layer for oxidation, resulting in separate streams of protons and hydroxide ions. The BPE's performance scalability depends on thermodynamic potentials and electrocatalyst effectiveness, and its design prevents parasitic ion crossover, eliminating the need for ion-exchange membranes, presenting significant advantages over BPMs. Applications include production and recovery of organic acids and bases, purification of mineral ores, and production of cementitious materials. Advantages include total blockage of ion crossover, lower overpotential, increased energy efficiency, increased throughput and reduced capital cost, easier manufacturing, greater durability, and low cost.",

These protein degraders can be used to promote the degradation of integrins, which have implications in several fibrotic diseases, and serve as a highly effective therapeutic for patients suffering from fibrosis. Organ fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), which ultimately disrupt normal tissue architecture and functions. For example, renal fibrosis affects 800 million people worldwide and dialysis treatment is becoming a significant economic burden. As the principal ECM receptor, integrins are implicated in diverse fibrotic diseases such as renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and scleroderma fibrosis. Despite the tremendous interest, the development of inhibitors focusing on integrins has faced substantial challenges such as low in vivo efficacy, undesired effects, lack of tissue specificity, and integrin subtype specificity. Protein degraders of integrins have resulted in the first known class of integrin inactivators that induce degradation of a cell-surface integrin via lysosomal targeting instead of simply blocking integrin activity. Importantly, targeting integrins in this manner addresses the four key challenges mentioned in the previous paragraph. Consequently, inducing degradation of integrins can drastically improve fibrosis treatment efficacy and transform the fibrotic disease medical field.",

    "ip_description": "To manage the development and progression of glaucoma, researchers at Stanford University have developed a biocompatible suprachoroidal spacer implant. This implant leverages a specialized delivery system into the suprachoroidal space, and effectively lowers the intraocular pressure (IOP). Elevated IOP is a major risk factor for glaucoma, which is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. While there are several methods to reduce IOP, each approach has inherent limitations. Daily eyedrop administration can be compromised by patient medication adherence and limited tolerability; laser procedures are not adequately effective for many patients; current surgical procedures damage the conjunctiva and are ultimately compromised by scarring; and sustained-release drug-loaded implants may damage the anterior chamber and in any case only last months. As a promising alternative, Stanford researchers have developed a suprachoroidal implant effective at lowering IOP. The implant can be delivered by a custom microneedle injector that is designed to avoid requiring any suturing after delivery, and therefore can be performed in the outpatient clinic setting. Being able to lower intraocular pressure with a one-time treatment that can be performed in the clinic and without needing to go to the operating room could revolutionize glaucoma care. Upon implantation within the suprachoroidal space, uveoscleral aqueous outflow increases, leading to a sustained reduction in IOP. Delivery and data validation in relevant laboratory models has been achieved. The researchers have prototypes of the implant and the injector that are being actively improved and optimized. They have completed _ex vivo_ experiments and are preparing for _in vivo_ studies. Applications include lowering IOP to mediate conditions such as Glaucoma, Ocular hypertension, Exfoliation syndrome, and Pigment dispersion syndrome. Advantages include long-term IOP control without daily management, monolithic implant with structural integrity, biocompatible, minimally invasive, office-based procedure, easy to deploy in underdeveloped setting, does not hinder the ability to perform additional glaucoma surgery, no cyclodialysis cleft, merging the anterior chamber with the suprachoroidal space, no anterior chamber manipulation and no expected endothelial cell loss, and precise injection with customized injector.",

The multi-channel stimulation proposed is favorably delivered to the fingertips. However, it can also be applied to other parts of the hand and, in general, to other parts of the body. This new treatment can induce long-lasting, sustained therapeutic effects that outlast cessation of stimulation, so that a few hours of stimulation delivered regularly or occasionally may provide substantial relief. First in man study showed promising preliminary results. The recently published paper is listed below. Stage of Research: A first in man study based on vibrotactile coordinated reset stimulation (CRS) completed. CRS consists of spatiotemporal sequences of stimuli delivered to different sites in the brain. It is believed to be the first demonstration that vibrotactile CRS is safe and tolerable and improves gait and bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease. Moreover, there was still improvement one and four weeks after stimulation was stopped, suggesting a cumulative and long-lasting effect of the stimulation. Applications: Treatment of brain disorders characterized by abnormal neuronal synchrony such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, dysfunction after stroke, and movement disorders (e.g. essential tremor, dystonia). Advantages: This new device is easy-to-develop, easy-to-test, and easy-to-implement. Non-invasive, thus avoiding risks associated with invasive treatments such as deep brain stimulation. No medication administered, thus eliminating side effects of medication. Treatment is favorably delivered to fingertips but can be applied to other parts of the body. Low risk with low costs.

The 3D bioprinting technology uses biomaterials and cells to construct functional 3D structures with potential applications as tissues, organs, or drug delivery vehicles. Polylactic acid (PLA) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) are commonly used for bioprinting due to their mechanical integrity and biodegradability, but they pose a risk of an inflammatory response as their acidic degradation byproducts accumulate. PCL, another robust biodegradable biomaterial, produces fewer acidic byproducts. It is a promising alternative when blended with gelatin, which has fast degradation kinetics. Although Homogeneous PCL gelatin (PG) blends have been made before using electrospinning, the resulting products were limited in geometry and lacked consistency in fiber quality. Stanford researchers have devised a methodology to fabricate a more versatile homogeneous PG composite with tunable degradation kinetics and high biocompatibility. Gelatin nanoparticles embedded in this composite can be taken up by cells to enhance proliferation and differentiation. This bioactivity persists even after repeated exposure to high temperatures (>100 \u00b0C). Therefore, the new PG composite can be extruded into bioactive 3D filaments to be used for a variety of biofabrication applications. The researchers have completed in vitro assessments of cell proliferation and toxicity and in vivo implantations in rats to establish safety and efficacy. Applications include regenerative medicine research, drug testing, bone grafting, tissue repair, controlled-release drug delivery, and biocompatible implants. Advantages include biocompatibility with limited immunogenicity, fast and tunable degradation, gelatin nanoparticles that aid cell proliferation and differentiation, the ability to withstand repeated exposure to high temperatures while retaining bioactivity, and high customizability in final construct geometry.

However, the use of rAAV is limited by its immunogenicity, which can result in reduced therapeutic efficacy as well as dangerous and even deadly reactions in patients. While rAAV engineering promises less immunogenic vectors, these efforts are hindered by a lack of tools for predicting immunogenicity pre-clinically. Animal models have very different immune systems from humans, while cell-based models are non-physiological and display poor immune responses to rAAV. Assays employing human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are similarly limited by wide variability between donors and low sensitivity. To address this challenge, Stanford researchers developed a new tool for predicting innate immune responses to rAAV. rAAV capsids are first opsonized (tagged for recognition by the immune system) with an anti-AAV monoclonal antibody and then incubated with human PBMCs. PBMC immune activation can be measured by cytokine production or the expression of T-cell activation markers. Researchers showed that opsonization enabled immune responses from otherwise unresponsive PBMCs and discrimination between closely related but differentially immunogenic rAAVs. Stage of Development: In vitro: assay elicits an rAAV-induced immune response in otherwise unresponsive PBMCs that increases with exposure to unmethylated CpGs. Applications: Tools for rAAV research, Clinical development of rAAV-mediated vaccines and gene therapies, Validation of lot-to-lot rAAV consistency during manufacturing, Basis for human subject inclusion or exclusion in rAAV clinical trials, Companion diagnostic for evaluating patient suitability for rAAV gene therapies. Advantages: High sensitivity, Simple, in vitro assay, Distinguishes immune responses towards closely related rAAV vectors, Predicts immune responses without the need for animal models, Overcomes issues with variability between PBMC donors.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a strategy for secondary wastewater treatment using a membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) design that enables the simultaneous removal of pollutants and recovery of potent greenhouse gas (N2O) emissions. Conventional domestic wastewater treatment is based on aerobic processes, resulting in a large carbon footprint due to high energy consumption and N2O emissions during biological nitrogen removal. A recent systems-level analysis emphasizes that carbon footprint due to N2O emissions is more significant than the footprint resulting from energy use. Anaerobic secondary treatment has been proposed to enable energy-efficient removal of organic matter but will have similar N2O emissions in a post-treatment for biological nitrogen removal. A method for N2O emission control is clearly needed. To address this, Stanford researchers developed a novel strategy where a membrane-aerated bioreactor (MABR) is incorporated for both aerobic secondary treatment and tertiary treatment after anaerobic secondary treatment to recover N2O produced during biological nitrogen treatment. Biofilm attached to gas permeable membrane surfaces in the MABR effectively remove biodegradable compounds from the aqueous phase, enabling low energy consumption. The biofilms also create a driving force for counter diffusion of N2O from the membrane-attached biofilm into the lumen of the membranes. This driving force increases N2O concentration within the lumen, facilitating recovery of N2O-enriched off-gas and minimization in carbon footprint. The N2O-enriched off-gas can be used for energy production in a biogas engine or in a system that recovers combined heat and power (CHP). Stage of Development: Pilot: treatment of 4,320 gallons of secondary effluent per day at the Silicon Valley Clean Water wastewater treatment facility, enabling recovery of > 99% N2O with a low energy requirement (0.06 kWh/m3). Applications: Wastewater treatment. Advantages: Simple, single-step process, Enables reduction in > 90% greenhouse gas emissions, Low energy requirement due to highly efficient aeration, Improved versatility and reliability of wastewater treatment.",

    "ip_name": "Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Management of Enteric Diseases",
    "ip_number": "S07-230",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "There is an urgent need for the development of sensitive, specific and non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of patients with enteropathic diseases such as celiac sprue. Such biomarkers could be used in primary screening of potential patients, definitive diagnosis of suspected patients, monitoring response to therapies, drug compliance assessment, and cost-effective drug development. Two such biomarkers, summarized below, have been invented and patented at Stanford University. For simplicity, the descriptions that follow are limited to their relevance to celiac sprue, although application to other enteric diseases (e.g. inflammatory bowel diseases) is also anticipated.\n\nBackground:\n\nCurrent diagnostic methods for celiac sprue are based on serum antibody tests, a small bowel biopsy, and a clinical response to a gluten-free diet. Although antibody tests are fairly specific, patients must be exposed to the discomfort of high doses of gluten over extended durations before they seroconvert. Whereas small bowel biopsies are the 'gold standard', they are obtained via invasive and expensive endoscopic procedures; their handling and examination requires considerable expertise and is often subjective. Clinical signs and symptoms associated with celiac sprue are variable, even in the same patient, and therefore not particularly useful. For example, although patients with active celiac sprue show statistically significant differences in fat or xylose absorption or lactulose permeability compared to patients in remission, these markers are peripherally related to celiac sprue immunopathogenesis, and can undergo significant changes due to factors unrelated to the disease. There is therefore an urgent need for biomarkers that complement the strengths and weaknesses of serological and histological tests in the context of diagnosis.\n\nAlthough a definitive path for celiac sprue drug development has not been established, ongoing efforts are based on clinical protocols that are adapted from existing diagnostic practices. For example, changes in histology, serology, fat or xylose absorption, lactulose permeability, and gastrointestinal symptoms are generally monitored either in the context of a gluten challenge (if the protective capacity of the drug candidate is being evaluated) or along the normal course of recovery (if the ability of the drug candidate to accelerate full recovery is being evaluated). There is an urgent need for 'scaleable biomarkers' that can serve as useful, preferably primary, endpoints in early proof-of-concept clinical trials as well as late-stage registration trials.\nOn a longer-term horizon, as new drugs for celiac sprue are approved, one can anticipate a need for biomarkers that facilitate assessment of compliance and response to therapy. Not only would this enhance the physician's ability to manage the patient's life-long disease, but it would also add value to selected drugs in an increasingly competitive market.\n\nThe Technologies:\n\n*   (1) By altering key residues in naturally occurring gluten peptide, a family of synthetic peptide biomarkers has been designed to mimic immunotoxic gluten peptides in terms of their resistance to gastrointestinal proteases and susceptibility to therapeutic glutenases. However, in contrast to immunotoxic gluten peptides (e.g. the 33-mer), these biomarkers are neither substrates of human transglutaminase 2 nor are they high-affinity ligands for HLA-DQ2. Consequently, these biomarkers are non-inflammatory, and carbon-13, hydrogen-2, or alternatively labeled versions can safely be administered orally to celiac sprue patients in conjunction with a drug or placebo. If the drug is a glutenase, then the levels of the labeled amino acids in bodily fluids such as serum, breath or urine provide insight into the efficacy of a drug such as an oral glutenase. If the drug modulates the response of celiac mucosa to gluten via other mechanisms, then the level of the labeled peptide itself (or a partially proteolyzed metabolite) in a bodily fluid is useful for assessing the extent of leakiness of the epithelial barrier of the celiac small intestine. The latter analytical measurement could also be used in the context of other inflammatory bowel diseases where mucosal leakiness is elevated.\n*   (2) The second biomarker technology is designed as a non-invasive, quantitative surrogate for the small bowel biopsy in celiac sprue. Certain xenobiotic cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP3A4, are highly active in enterocytes as well as liver cells. However, in contrast to the liver, where their expression level is relatively constant, CYP3A levels can fluctuate significantly in the small bowel. For example, CYP3A4 is abundant in enterocytes near villous tips but not near the crypts, suggesting that CYP3A4 activity correlates with enterocyte maturity. Dietary gluten is known to induce abnormal enterocyte morphology and physiology in celiac patients. Consequently, celiac patients with active disease have decreased CYP3A4 protein and activity levels in their small intestine, both of which recover to normal after introduction of a gluten-free diet. Thus, the efficacy of a celiac drug can be conveniently monitored using intestinal CYP3A4 activity as a surrogate for gluten-induced enteropathy. For example, the widely used drug, simvastatin, is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 in the small intestine. Changes in the Cmax and AUC of oral simvastatin could therefore be correlated with the early onset of villus damage in a celiac sprue patient. Pending clinical proof-of-concept, the test could be readily adapted into a finger-stick or urine test format.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Biomarkers for diagnosis and drug development for celiac disease, and potentially other enteric diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   Large potential impact - 1 in 200 people are affected by celiac disease\n*   Less invasive than bowel biopsy\n*   Complements existing histological & serological tests",

Transplants are often life-saving treatments and with a limited organ supply optimizing preservation during transit is crucial for enhancing access and health outcomes. The current standard for donor organ preservation involves a sterile ice-filled cooler ranging between 2-4\u00b0C. While a low temperature is necessary to slow tissue deterioration, recent studies indicate that such low temperatures might also increase the risk of freeze-related injury, limiting the organ's transplant viability. A storage temperature closer to 10\u00b0C could offer better preservation, but no existing portable system can maintain this range for an extended period. MoTEC, a thermoelectric cooler designed to keep a donor organ at a stable 10\u00b0C (+/-1\u00b0C) while in transit, aims to address this challenge. The solution consists of a two-compartment system with an outer recirculating water cooling unit and an inner organ storage chamber. The system offers temperature control and wireless monitoring through continuous feedback-regulated cooling via custom-designed pumps and sensors. MoTEC is powered by an external battery, allowing for up to 4 hours of standalone operation, with the flexibility for longer use when connected to a power source. Following each transport, the system can be sterilized and reused, resulting in both a smaller spatial footprint and lower costs. Applications: Lung organ preservation during transit, Heart organ preservation during transit, Kidney organ preservation during transit, Liver organ preservation during transit. Advantages: Lower probability of temperature-driven ischemic injury: optimal temperature maintenance during transit, Greater temperature control: continuous feedback-regulated cooling via integrated pump and sensors, Greater data availability: wireless temperature and power source monitoring, Greater cost savings: reusable design.",

    "ip_description": "The low efficacy of multi-strain vaccines against rapidly evolving viruses, such as influenza, necessitates the development of novel methods to broaden the immune response in vaccinated individuals. The efficacy of the current seasonal influenza vaccine typically ranges from 19% to 60%. We identified that the low efficacy is due to the phenomenon of subtype bias, which arises from limited CD4+ T cell 'help' across all strains. That is, even though the vaccine contains multiple strains, most individuals elicit a robust immune response to only one of the strains. This leaves individuals vulnerable to infection by other strains. Subtype bias occurs in approximately 65% of the vaccinated individuals which suggests that eliminating it may be a valid path to increase vaccine efficacy. Stanford scientists have discovered that coupling of antigens from multiple influenza strains can overcome subtype bias by increasing CD4+ T cell help, thereby inducing a robust immune response to all strains included in the formulation. The antibody response against multiple strains was higher with the coupled antigen formulation in comparison to the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine in a human organoid system, and a mouse model. Coupling of antigens can be a transformative method to eliminate subtype bias in multi-strain vaccine formulations needed against rapidly evolving pathogens, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Applications: Development of multi-strain vaccines against influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Elimination of response bias in vaccines formulated with multiple antigens.

Despite successes in generating certain types of brain progenitors and neurons from hPSCs, generating a wide range of these cells for various brain regions has remained difficult. In particular, it has remained incredibly challenging to generate hindbrain cells. The hindbrain is a key region that constitutes the majority of the brainstem and is a life-sustaining region that controls breathing, eating, wakefulness, and sleep. The Loh Lab at Stanford has developed methods to rapidly create forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain progenitors from hPSCs (within several days), and additionally, multiple types of forebrain and hindbrain neurons (within two weeks). This is accomplished by treating hPSCs with different combinations of extracellular signals in defined, serum-free medium.

Hindbrain motor neurons are destroyed by neuron degenerative diseases like spinal muscular atrophy. Therefore, the invention's newfound ability to create human hindbrain motor neurons and other types of neurons provides new opportunities for basic research, disease modeling, and regenerative therapies to replace missing or malfunctioning neurons in vivo.

Although in cases of minor injury, peripheral nerves can regenerate, for more severe injuries, direct microsurgical nerve repair is the preferred treatment. surgery often improves neurologic function in cases of severe peripheral nerve injury, but complete recovery of function is unfortunately quite rare. Surgical repair may fail to restore normal function as seen in approximately 40-60% of cases. There are currently no pharmacologic treatments available to patients that can accelerate nerve regeneration after injury and observation, direct surgical repair, or nerve graft repair. Given the high failure rate of complex nerve reconstruction, more effective methods of reconstruction are necessary.\n\nStanford researchers have found that a low dose of a small-molecule, systemic pathway agonist, SAG21k, improves nerve regeneration after injury and increases expression of injury-responsive genes within Schwann cells in the injured nerve. SAG21k is a potent hedgehog signaling pathway agonist that targets Smoothened, the key pathway effector protein.

Optimizing the differentiation and expansion of CD8 T cells can be a transformative method that increases the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapies. Synonymous single nucleotide variants (sSNVs), or silent mutations, are genetic variations that occur in protein-coding regions of the genome but do not change the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. While sSNVs were initially thought to be functionally neutral, they have recently been shown to effect gene expression, translation, and protein function. For example, the codon:anticodon specificity between a tRNA and an mRNA can affect the timing of translation and the co-translational folding of the protein. Despite their potential impact and prevalence, sSNVs are often overlooked in genome-wide association studies. Understanding the effects of sSNVs can gain insights into disease mechanisms and methods for optimizing precision medicine approaches. An sSNV that increases codon:anticodon affinity was found to be enriched in effector memory CD8 T cells (CD8 TEMs).

One of major hurdles to advancing RNA therapy is immunogenicity; injected or administered RNAs can be recognized by the immune system as foreign entities, triggering an innate immune response that might reduce the therapeutic efficacy and possibly cause side effects. There have been efforts to address this by modifying the structure or sequence of RNA nucleotides, suppressing the immune system, and packaging RNA within a shielding delivery system. Researchers at the Kool Lab in Stanford have identified a novel method to mitigate the immunogenicity problem. They used an acylating reagent to add acyl groups to the 2'-hydroxyl (OH) groups on RNAs. Lipofecting cells with the resulting polyacylated RNAs prevented recognition by toll-like receptors (TLRs) that typically trigger the immune response. Consequently, this led to a reduction in inflammatory responses without affecting translation. This approach is beneficial in that the RNA can be from any source and be of any length. Stage of Development: In vitro data in cultured cells. They are expanding the in vitro research to test in a wider range of cell types, including primary cells. Applications: mRNA vaccines, mRNA therapeutics, RNA interference, CRISPR therapies and diagnostics, siRNA, RNA aptamers, Anti-sense oligonucleotides. Advantages: Can address a wide range of diseases: Genetic disorders, Cancer, Neurological disorders, Infectious diseases; Allows for targeted therapy; Could be personalized; Post-transcriptional method; Can apply to RNAs of any length and origin; Reversible; Immune system not altered; Translation is not compromised; Rapid and simple modifications.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have facilitated active agent passage across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by conjugating the active agent with a plasma protein that gets taken up by microglia. The BBB is a partitioning layer that regulates the passage of substances to protect the brain from potential harm. While its selective permeability is crucial for neural protection, it makes drug delivery to the brain extremely difficult, limiting treatment efficacy for various neurological or psychiatric conditions. It is important to enable the necessary therapeutics to traverse the BBB in order to ensure targeted and efficient delivery to the intended brain region. Stanford researchers have discovered a brain drug delivery method that capitalizes on a natural transport mechanism. They identified and engineered a drug delivery platform based on a plasma protein called Apolipoprotein A1 (Apo1A1) that can inherently cross the BBB. The ApoA1-conjugated active therapeutic agent crossed the BBB successfully and was found in brain microglia in mice. Applications include brain drug delivery platform for: Neurodegenerative diseases, Brain tumors, Neurological infection, Pain management, Psychiatric disorders, Trauma. Advantages include: Novel, Leverages the natural uptake of plasma protein by microglia to cross the BBB, No alteration of the BBB or immune system required.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a process for synthetic palm oil production that is environmentally friendly and can be implemented locally by farmers. Palm oil is an essential commodity used in everything from processed foods to personal care items like toothpaste and soap. However, current methods for palm oil production are responsible for deforestation, greenhouse gas production, and the exploitation of farmers and their communities. Stanford researchers therefore developed a method for producing palm oil from agricultural waste that can be locally implemented by farmers themselves. Palm fronds are first pre-treated using microwave energy, an inexpensive and energy-efficient process that eliminates the need for chemical additives and extracts sugars from the palm fronds. Then, a yeast species specialized for fat production digests the sugars into fats that can serve as a drop-in replacement for palm oil in personal care products or as feedstock for biofuel production. Stage of Development: Proof of concept: demonstrated microwave pre-treatment process that extracts fermentable sugars and yeast fermentation process that can produce a drop-in replacement for palm oil. Applications: Drop-in replacement for palm oil in personal care/beauty products, Environmentally friendly and socially conscious personal care and beauty products, Feedstock for second generation biofuel production. Advantages: Use of waste material is inexpensive and environmentally friendly, Highly efficient pre-treatment process, Lack of harsh chemicals in pre-treatment process allows waste to be used as fertilizer, compost, etc., Optimized for use on farms in producing countries (not US-based labs), Decentralized approach is readily scalable.",

Current approaches to photocatalysis include semiconductors like titanium dioxide; however, they only absorb ultraviolet light, which forms less than 5% of the sunlight that reaches Earth. A promising approach is the use of hybrid plasmonic metal nanoparticle-semiconductor nanostructures, which are the strongest light absorbers per volume and have a highly tunable absorption cross-section that spans the entire visible and near-IR spectrum. Previous examples of plasmonic-semiconductor hybrids relied on noble metals like gold and silver, which prevented this technology from being scalable for real-world applications. Stanford researchers instead use core-shell hybrid nanoparticles from earth-abundant copper and titanium precursors. This invention is a simple two step method that can use sunlight to drive photocatalysis. Used for water purification, this invention does not require maintenance, is effective against chemicals, plastics, and pathogens, and results in no toxic byproducts.

The nanoparticles precisely incorporate the TLR agonist, yielding a tightly controlled composition that is then released at a consistent manner under physiological conditions, therefore reducing toxicity. Researchers in the Davis lab treated mice with these engineered TLR7-NPs and observed inhibition of tumor growth, prolonged survival, and effective immunological memory in colon, pancreatic, and glioma cancer models. Mice treated with TLR7-NPs and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade therapy in combination exhibited even more robust antitumor efficacy, eliminating all tumors in a colon cancer model, and rejecting the second tumor challenge. This combination therapy also induces tumor regression and improves survival in a pancreatic cancer model. These results were recapitulated in a human skin tumor organoid where TLR7-NP and anti-PD-1 combination therapy induced a robust T cell response. Mechanistically, the TLR7-NPs are hypothesized to increase conventional dendritic cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes, expanding functional CD8+ T cell memory and activation for antitumor responses.

Vaccines made from inactivated viruses or protein subunits offer numerous advantages. However, with current aluminum-based adjuvants, these vaccines often require multiple doses or fail to elicit broad antibody responses against constantly mutating viruses such as seasonal influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2 virus. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists have shown promise as more potent adjuvants, but progress has been limited by toxic side effects. In response, the researchers have applied well-controlled chemistry to formulate an adjuvant from PEG-PLGA nanoparticles loaded with TLR7 agonist via an ester linkage. This chemistry allows for the programmed release profile of TLR7 agonist in the body - slow release in circulation and faster release in intracellular endosomes, promoting immune responses and reducing systemic serum cytokine expression. This adjuvant platform also improves lymph node accumulation and enhances cellular uptake, which leads to significant improvement of humoral and cellular immune responses, including broad antibodies against different antigenic variants and cytotoxic T cell responses. Notably, it can induce stalk-specific influenza hemagglutinin antibodies (considered an important goal in developing a universal flu vaccine).\n\nStage of Development\nPre-clinical.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a technique that can rapidly and sequentially separate multiple sets of III-V solar cell thin films grown as a stack on one III-V wafer. Their rapid laser liftoff wafer recovery technique may reduce cost and fabrication time by an order of magnitude. Currently, gallium arsenide (GaAs) single crystal growth substrates \u2013 used for the best performing solar cells \u2013 are expensive and difficult to grow (accounting for an estimated 1/3 of the cost of GaAs solar cells). Because the GaAs solar cells do not depend on the substrate for operation, it is desirable that the solar cell thin films be removed from the GaAs wafer and the wafer reused for multiple growths. The Stanford process, by effectively multiplying the number of cells that may be recovered per wafer reuse, can significantly increase throughput and reduce costs. Moreover, the process is not limited to solar cells and may be used to produce many III-V thin film devices.\n\nThe researchers report that their process achieves the same effect as multiplying the number of possible wafer recovery cycles by x, where x is the number of devices grown per growth process. In other words, if a wafer can be reused 10 times with the laser liftoff process, growing 5 devices per growth would be equivalent to reusing the wafer 50 times, therefore lowering the average substrate cost.\n\nApplications:\n- Single-crystal III-V optoelectronic thin film devices such as high-efficiency single- and multi-junction III-V solar cells, LEDs, and detectors (e.g., ejected detector arrays).\n\nAdvantages:\n- Leverages the unique benefits of laser liftoff relative to other wafer recovery techniques, e.g., the process takes minutes instead of hours and does not require long substrate acid exposure.\n- Allows for multiple devices from each substrate use.\n- Compared to laser liftoff of a single device, this process reduces the average energy consumed per device produced by utilizing only a single substrate heating and cooling cycle per set of x devices, thus reducing the time for energy payback.\n- Precludes poor surface quality issues. Sending the laser pulse through the device instead of the substrate eliminates the need to protect the optical quality of the substrate backside (i.e., lower surface) during thin film growths.",

Jelena Vuckovic's group solves this problem by combining the laser feedback stabilization and isolator into a single integrated device (see figure 1). This device uses a high quality factor ring or disk resonator that acts as a circulator under high optical power.

Cancer represents a wide spectrum of molecularly and morphologically diverse diseases. Individuals with the same histopathological classification can have tumors with drastically different molecular profiles and clinical responses to treatment. Malignancy is defined by a set of abnormal biological capacities, termed the hallmarks of cancer, and decades of histopathologic and molecular profiling of human tumors have demonstrated that there are multiple ways cells can acquire each hallmark. As a result, the molecular profile of tumors with the same clinical characteristics can vary dramatically from individual to individual, and it is unclear when these molecular differences originate, all of which can impact treatment options. Finally, current prediction of relapse is generally only 1-5 years, and it is desirable to obtain more accuracy to determine proper treatment and when a pre-malignant tumor will become malignant. The inventors have developed methods to use (i) a tumor subtype (malignant or premalignant) of a subject, e.g. whether a particular cancer has an alteration in a particular region, and (ii) germline epitope burden for the particular region, e.g. amount of peptide epitopes generated from the germline of a subject, to determine the probability: (i) of a relapse of a particular tumor subtype, (ii) of immune response given a particular subtype, and (ii) that a pre-malignant lesion will become malignant. Applications include methods to investigate germline-mediated immunoediting, molecular modeling for improving cancer risk stratification, predicting relapse of a particular tumor subtype in a subject, predicting immune response of a particular cancer subtype in a subject, and predicting the risk of premalignant tissue becoming cancerous in a subject. Advantages include using a measurement of epitope subtype burden, along with tumor subtype, can increase accuracy of relapse prediction.

Using machine-learning to detect DMRs in blood-based tests could increase cancer screening uptake in high-risk adults and reduce lung-cancer-related mortality. Image-based screening of high-risk adults, such as individuals with a history of smoking, reduces lung-cancer-related mortality; however, uptake of screening has been relatively low. Only around 5% of eligible individuals undergo screening due to factors such as high costs, limited access, and concerns for false positives. Genomic blood tests for cancer screening could be an effective alternative to increase the total number of patients screened and the number of lives saved annually from lung-cancer-related mortality. But current methods suffer from low sensitivity or have focused on diseases other than lung cancer. Interestingly, aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to be associated with lung ctDNA, suggesting that the use of DMRs as a biomarker in blood-based lung cancer screening could increase its sensitivity and utility in early cancer detection. Including DNA methylation in a machine-learning enabled molecular method for lung cancer screening resulted in a positive correlation between DMR detection and the fraction of ctDNA in the sample. Importantly, the novel, blood-based method for early cancer detection has a 15% increase in sensitivity relative to the leading published method. Consequently, including DNA methylation in blood-based tests for early cancer detection has the potential to drastically improve screening sensitivity, increase cancer screening uptake in high-risk adults, and reduce lung-cancer-related mortality.

In proof-of-concept studies, they were exposed to polystyrene (PS), one of the most commonly used plastics and environmental pollutants. Plastic pollution is increasing at an alarming rate, yet the impact of this pollution on human health is poorly understood. Since skin is the most frequently used source for derivation of hiPSCs and in direct contact with pollutants, hiPSCs derived from dermal fibroblasts offer a powerful platform to start to identify molecular biomarkers of environmental pollution in human cells.\n\nAdult human dermal fibroblasts, used for their reprogramming and derivation of hiPSCs, were exposed to PS. The genetic and epigenetic profiles of both exposed fibroblasts and derived hiPSC were studied, revealing commonly altered genes, signaling circuits, and pathways involved in human diseases. Even when exposed to a low concentration of PS, hiPSCs demonstrated altered DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiles. This strategy for deriving new hiPSC lines can help define the impact of epigenetic memory/mechanisms and environmental pollution on human health, identifying specific cellular responses, and narrowing down the list of candidate biomarkers. The derived cell lines can thus help to decipher the origins of environment-related diseases and offer new therapeutic targets.\n\nThis strategy can also be applied to study or test new drugs, cosmetic products, chemicals, or any other exposure factor, not just environmental pollutants. It can be used to establish a cell bank that will supply researchers (environmental investigators, clinicians, drug developers) with fibroblasts or cells of other origin pre-exposed to different factors and the derived hiPSCs.

Specifically, the task of obtaining a homogenous population of liver cells from human pluripotent stem cells has proven to be challenging. Current methods result in a mixture of liver cells and non-liver cell populations. To remedy this problem, Stanford researchers have developed a new approach based on metabolic selection to create purified human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) derived hepatocytes by selectively killing non-liver cells.\n\nThe new approach is based on the concept that different cell-types have distinct metabolic requirements to survive, and can thus be killed by withholding specific nutrients. Using this method, the researchers are able to create essentially homogeneous populations of hPSC-derived hepatocytes, without recourse to surface marker-based cell sorting or other purification schemas. Ultimately, a pure population of hepatocytes cells will be immensely useful for applications in regenerative medicine and disease modeling.\n\n**Stage of Development**\nPre-clinical: Stanford researchers are performing additional mouse transplantation studies to test whether the human pluripotent stem cell-derived liver cells can engraft long term in the injured mouse liver.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Purify stem cell-derived liver cells\n*   Purify mixed population of liver and non-liver cells\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   Simple, scalable, and inexpensive\n*   Compatible with cells produced by various differentiation methods",

    "ip_description": "Stanford University researchers have developed aptamer-antibody chimeras that achieve dynamic, sensitive, and specific biomolecule sensing beyond the capacity of antibodies or aptamers alone. DNA aptamers are short sequences of engineered DNA that selectively bind to a target molecule and generate a reversible fluorescent or electrochemical signal in response, enabling continuous sensing in applications from diagnostics to environmental monitoring. However, aptamers are limited by poor sensitivity. Researchers therefore combined the signaling abilities of an aptamer with the high sensitivity and specificity of a monoclonal antibody by combining the two components with a short DNA linker. This new sensor can detect target molecules at very low concentrations (Kd = ~100 pM) even in complex samples, enabling rapid, direct detection in biofluids or environmental samples without expensive and time-consuming sample preparation. Sensors can track changes in target concentration over time with high temporal resolution (~10 minutes). Sensors are easy to engineer, as they can take advantage of existing antibodies and aptamers without any further engineering. Features like affinity, sensitivity, and temporal response can be rationally tuned by changing the length of the DNA linker or modifying the aptamer sequence. Applications include fluorescent or electrochemical signal output, wearable or implantable biosensors, point-of-care and at-home diagnostics, personalized medicine, and wastewater and agricultural monitoring. Advantages include sensitivity superior to traditional DNA aptamers (Kd = ~100 pM), no requirement for a secondary antibody, preparation-free, direct sensing in complex samples, continuous sensing of changes in target concentration over time, temporal resolution of ~10 minutes, and highly modular and tunable.",

Cost effective and power efficient Space Division Multiplexing (SDM) scaling and integration in long-haul optical communications systems is key in supporting future demands of today's digital society. The Optical Communications Group designed multimode erbium-doped fiber amplifier (MM-EDFA) for six spatial modes (12 spatial and polarization modes) includes a graded-index (GI) multimode fiber amplifier with optimized ring erbium doping profile, length, and pump mode powers. A cascade of wavelength- and mode-selective couplers efficiently couples four pump diodes to four pump modes, while passing signal modes with minimal loss. This design uses fewer pump laser diodes per signal with lower cost, complexity, and power consumption than parallel SMF-based systems.

The approach allows for identification of axon regeneration-associated genes, which are promising therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases. Axonopathy is a common early feature of central nervous system (CNS) neurodegenerative diseases, including glaucoma and ALS, which is characterized by axon degeneration followed by progressive neuronal cell body death. The axons of adult CNS neurons do not regenerate spontaneously after degeneration, which causes irreversible neuronal function deficits. There are currently no neural repair therapies. The application of the novel technique is exemplified by the researchers' successful identification of several novel regeneration-associated genes (Anxa2, tPA, Mpp1, ILK, and more) that significantly promote axon regeneration, dramatically protect retinal ganglion cells and optic nerves, and preserves visual function in a clinically relevant model of glaucoma. Stage of Development: In vivo: proof-of-concept demonstration of AAV-mediated expression of several identified genes, including Anxa2, ILK, and Mpp1, for neuroprotection and axon regeneration in mouse glaucoma model.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a new avenue for stimulating T effector and Treg immune cells in an antigen-specific manner. Commensal microbiota have been shown to functionally regulate the innate and adaptive immune systems and must establish distinct niches at barrier sites throughout the human body. To prevent aberrant immune responses to commensal microbiota, Treg cells participate in tissue-specific immune regulation at barrier sites where they typically reside. In contrast, T effector cells generally amplify pro-inflammatory responses in an antigen-specific manner. In another vein, autoimmune diseases are estimated to effect up to 1 in every 10 individuals. Expanding Treg populations in the setting of autoimmune diseases is highly desirable and has shown favorable results in several animal models. However, methods for expanding these specific cells in vivo in a safe and efficacious manner are still elusive. The inventors have pioneered a new approach to elicit and expand antigen-specific Tregs and T effector cells. Helicobacter hepaticus bacteria can be engineered to express a heterologous non-native protein or peptide. This peptide or protein could be of interest in an autoimmune disease or a specific cancer, among other things. Subsequently, dendritic cells will then phagocytose the bacteria, digest, and present the heterologous protein or peptide to na\u00efve T-cells. In parallel, Treg-inducing cytokines will be administered to induce differentiation of na\u00efve T-cells into Tregs. Once completed, this process will result in a Treg cell that has a TCR specific for a host antigen of interest. The inventors have also laid out a similar process for producing antigen-specific T effector cells. Applications include creating T effector cells that are antigen-specific for proteins or peptides selectively expressed on the cell surface of cancer cells and creating Tregs that are antigen-specific for proteins or peptides implicated in autoimmune diseases. Advantages include a customizable platform that is able to be modified to treat a number of diseases.",

    "ip_number": "S22-419",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are essential for hearing as they transmit electrical signals from the cochlea to the brain. Loss of SGNs causes permanent hearing loss because SGNs do not spontaneously regenerate in humans. Despite their scientific and clinical importance, the developmental, cellular, and molecular features of human SGNs remain poorly characterized due to the limited accessibility to the human inner ear and incomplete phenotypic conversion of stem cells into SGN-like cells in vitro. Unfortunately, a fundamental obstacle in the study of human SGNs is the inability to obtain routine tissue biopsies due to the small size of the cochlea, its complex three-dimensional anatomy, and encasement in dense bone. To overcome this challenge, inventors at Stanford have developed a novel method for generating human spiral ganglion neurons using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to generate functional SGNs via otic neurosensory progenitor cells (ONPs) in vitro. Utilizing the method enables the mimicking of in vivo cell-to-cell signaling occurring during human inner ear development. This is the first comprehensive description of the heterogeneity of human auditory neuronal populations using high-resolution transcriptomic profiling of individual cells, coupled with electrophysiological characterization of the cells' functional diversification. These human neurons offer powerful cellular models to decipher the precise mechanisms underlying hearing disorders and to enable future targeted therapies. The invention offers a novel platform to answer fundamental questions in auditory research and facilitate therapeutic innovation for sensorineural hearing loss. The high-efficiency, monolayer SGN culture protocol could be a reliable source of cells for drug screening. Unlike 3D organoids, the invented method results in 2D cultures that are representative of their in vivo counterparts and provide benefits for easier scale-up, monitoring, functional tests, and quality control in a realistic way, as has already been demonstrated using dissociated mouse SGNs. Finally, this protocol could be used to test potentially regenerative, patient-specific therapies aimed at replacing or repairing human SGNs. Applications: - Therapeutic innovation for sensorineural hearing loss - Understanding of the normal, as well as abnormal, development of the human auditory system - Understanding inherited disorders leading to hearing loss. - Drug screening - 2D in vivo cultures for easier scale-up, monitoring, functional tests, and quality control - Regenerative, patient-specific therapies aimed at replacing or repairing human SGNs Advantages: - Novel platform to answer fundamental questions in auditory research and facilitate therapeutic innovation for sensorineural hearing loss - 2D cultures for easier scale-up, monitoring, functional tests, and quality control of high-throughput drug screening - First comprehensive description of the heterogeneity of human auditory neuronal populations using high-resolution transcriptomic profiling of individual cells, coupled with electrophysiological characterization of the cells' functional diversification.",

However, intravenous or bolus delivery of bacteriophage has not been effective due to lack of local targeting over long times.

This invention can non-invasively concentrate ultrasound waves onto peripheral nerves without impacting surrounding tissue. It uses focused ultrasound waves to block pain fibers for 1-2 weeks with minimal motor fiber blockage, avoiding problems with common pharmaceutical painkillers and traditional 'nerve block' techniques.\n\nPain after surgery or injury is often moderate-to-severe for 1-2 weeks and the majority of patients have poorly controlled acute pain during this time. Moderate-to-severe acute pain is associated with increased risk of a wide array of worsened health outcomes including developing myocardial ischemia, impaired pulmonary function, ileus, thromboembolism, impaired immune function, infection, and anxiety. Opioids are commonly prescribed to treat pain and they do well at controlling dull, burning, or rest pain, but don't do as well at controlling sharp or movement pain. Traditional 'nerve blocks' use inject local anesthetics near nerves; these local anesthetic drugs block all nerve fibers, not just pain fibers, including motor and non-pain sensory fibers, which can increase the risk of a patient falling and prevents early participation in physical therapy. There is therefore a significant need for a non-invasive, non-drug based pain therapy which can block acute pain for 1-2 weeks after surgery or injury without the risk of major side effects. This invention can non-invasively and reversibly inhibit peripheral nerves with no risk of serious side effects and has the potential to greatly improve the standard of care for patients managing acute pain.\n\n**Stage of Development**\nPre-clinical, proof of concept in animals\n\n**Related Technologies:**\nStanford docket 17-430: [Acute and Chronic Pain Suppression through Targeted Peripheral Nerve Application of Focused Ultrasound](https://techfinder.stanford.edu/technology/acute-and-chronic-pain-suppression-through-targeted-peripheral-nerve-application-focused)\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Acute pain management\n*   Chronic pain management\n*   Pain management after surgery and trauma\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   The only current focused ultrasound device for peripheral nervous system neuromodulation to suppress acute pain\n*   Alternative to opioid treatment and traditional nerve blocks\n*   Non-invasive\n*   Easy to administer\n*   Optimized nerve fiber selectivity\n*   No risk of serious side effects\n*   Can block pain fibers for different durations",

Although irradiation does not cause immediate symptoms or pain, children placed in an unfamiliar and isolated setting for an extended amount of time may feel anxious and find remaining still difficult. To ensure that the procedure is not traumatizing nor prolonged, pediatric patients are often anesthetized. Some patients who need multiple consecutive sessions may even be anesthetized daily, putting them at risk of brain damage and subjecting them to overnight fasting, invasive procedures, and increased treatment cost and time.

This solution addresses a longstanding challenge, ensuring stable cycling of metallic lithium even under high current densities and realistic cell conditions. Traditionally, metallic lithium has struggled with cyclic instability at elevated current densities, limiting its application in high-power scenarios. However, the CF-based hybrid lithium-ion/lithium-metal anode technology achieves a remarkable >99% Coulombic Efficiency (CE) at 12 mA/cm\u00b2 (4 mAh/cm\u00b2) and >99.5% CE at 16 mA/cm\u00b2 (2.5 mAh/cm\u00b2) with a standard carbonate electrolyte.

The cyclic stability at these elevated currents surpasses that of graphite, marking a significant leap forward in lithium-ion battery technology. In a market dominated by graphite, this carbon flower anode material represents a transformative leap forward. With twice the specific capacity at low current densities and four times the capacity at high current densities, coupled with unmatched cyclic stability, it stands poised to redefine the future of high-performance lithium-ion battery technology.

Supplemented CAR-T cells were shown to use inosine as a carbon source, relieving tumor-imposed metabolic restrictions on T cells and leading to increased anti-tumor potency in vitro. The supplemented CAR-T cells can further improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive T cell therapies in vivo, prolonging survival in mouse models of solid tumors unable to metabolize inosine. This method can be used during CAR-T cell manufacturing or in further immunotherapy research and development efforts to improve CAR-T cell function.\n\nApplications:\n* This method can be used by stakeholders with an interest in improving CAR-T cell efficacy:\n    * Academic researchers\n    * Biotech companies\n    * Pharmaceutical companies\n    * Cell manufacturing centers\n\nAdvantages:\n* Easy method implementation\n* Improved anti-tumor potency of CAR-T cells\n* Improved persistence of CAR-T cells in vivo\n* Improved efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive T cell therapies",

    "ip_description": "Stanford Scientists have developed an innovative approach that enhances the antitumor efficacy of CAR T cells by overexpressing Adenosine Deaminase 1 (ADA), an enzyme responsible for metabolizing adenosine into inosine, to attenuate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Although promising, CAR T cell therapy efficacy in solid tumors is limited by hostile tumor microenvironments, limited CAR T persistence, and lack of tumor killing. Extracellular adenosine contributes to the hostile tumor microenvironment by binding the adenosine A2a receptor on immune cells. Blocking A2aR or enhancing ADA-mediated adenosine metabolism to inosine protects T cells from adenosine-mediated immunosuppression. Stanford scientists showed that human CAR T cells are also susceptible to adenosine-mediated immunosuppression. They developed an approach where they overexpressed ADA in exhausted and non-exhausted CAR T cells leading to a higher frequency of stem cell-like memory T cell effectors, and a simultaneous decrease of exhausted subpopulations. Both antigen-driven proliferation and effector function of CAR T cells also significantly improved after ADA overexpression. Therefore, overexpression of adenosine deaminase in CAR T cells is a novel and efficient way to evade immunosuppression.",

Indeed, current approaches are limited as high-throughput evolutionary screens, that rely on random guessing or brute-force search, often devote substantial effort to interrogating weakly active or nonfunctional proteins.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a new methodology for image processing that allows for high-throughput characterization of organoid phenotypes. Organoids represent a major step forward in in vitro research studies into a myriad of disease states. 3D organoid models possess key advantages over conventional 2D cell culture models including a closer approximation of in vivo settings as well as a reduction of genomic background signal which in turn enables editing with CRISPR/Cas9 technology to further reproduce disease states. Current organoid construction involves resuspending aggregated cells in commercially available extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics, rather than from a single cell. Due to this property of their construction, it is difficult to determine whether an organoid phenotype has arisen from the stochasticity of the deposited cell population, or from an intrinsic property of individual cells. Single organoid phenotypic characterization remains a challenge. The inventors have identified a new microwell based technique for the high-throughput quantification of image-based parameters at single organoid resolution. This method can be used to phenotypically monitor thousands of organoids in parallel. Phenotypes such as organoid growth rates, migration behavior, and fluorescently labeled protein expression and localization are all parameters that can be assessed through this pipeline. Once profiled, organoids can be retrieved from their microwells for sequencing and molecular profiling to determine the genomic or proteomic origin of the organoid's phenotypic state. Applications include high-throughput drug screening of patient-derived human organoids, characterization of genetic mutations of interest in parallel, and elucidation of genetic mutations that contribute to tumor microenvironments. Advantages include organoid profiling not being restricted to bulk averages for parameters such as growth rates or division times, not requiring specialized instrumentation and therefore being an easy addition to existing cell culture workflows, and organoids being generated from single cells rather than aggregated cell populations.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a multiplexed bead-based dephosphorylation assay to allow for the measurement of multiple dephosphorylation reactions in one experiment. Post-translational modification involves the modification of proteins after they are translated from RNA and is an exciting area of study in biomedical science. Of these, phosphorylation is one of the most prevalent post-translational modifications which involves the addition of a phosphate to a protein substrate by kinases. This phosphate group can also be removed via phosphatases. Phosphorylation dynamics are a key regulatory mechanism in cells and is essential for cellular function. Understanding these dynamics is integral to the study of cellular processes in both health and disease. However, additional methods for the study of these dynamics in a high-throughput manner are needed. The inventors have developed the novel method MRBLE:Dephos. This method utilizes microfluidically produced hydrogel beads encoded with radiometric combinations of lanthanide nanophosphors (MRBLES). More specifically, this method quantifies binding of a fluorescently labeled protein or chemical group to 96 bead-bound peptides in parallel. The inventors have extended the MRBLES technique into the dephosphorylation space by producing a library of 96 Ser and Thr peptides on MRBLES with basic, acidic, or hydrophobic amino acids surrounding the phosphorylation site. This library can then be used to investigate the effect of amino acid intrinsic properties on dephosphorylation kinetics of a protein and/or binding site of interest by incubating with phosphatase and then quantifying phosphorylation of each unique peptide using a binding reagent specifically for phosphorylated proteins. Applications include evaluation of phosphorylation dynamics of many peptides in parallel and elucidating crosstalk between N-terminal and C-terminal residues surrounding phosphorylation sites of interest. Advantages include peptides can be directly synthesized on MRBLES resulting in small reaction volumes and minimal reagent waste, and the method is easily adaptable to other kinase assays.",

Protein-protein interactions are one of the most fundamental biological processes which biomedical science has sought to engineer. Many currently available medications selectively modulate one binding partner of a protein of interest for therapeutic benefit. Therefore, it is advantageous to be able to screen protein-protein interactions in an unbiased and high-throughput manner. Multiplexed microbead assays allow for massively multiplexed high throughput evaluation of a myriad of biological proteomic interactions. However, these assays often have a limited possible coding space with fluorescently encoded beads. The inventors have developed a method of screening that modulates protein-protein interactions. Specifically, a library of microfluidically-produced hydrogel beads encoded with radiometric combinations of lanthanide nanophosphors (MRBLES) are produced. Subsequently, a library of bead-bound peptides with bind site sequences are synthesized on the surface of those MRBLES. The MRBLES have embedded with lanthanide spectral codes that correspond to the binding site sequences. MRBLES with bind site sequence peptides are then incubated with a protein of interest and a factor, for example a small molecule that is thought to modulate binding between protein of interest and binding site sequences. Binding interactions in each well of an array are quantified via a detectable label (e.g. an antibody with an attached fluorophore). This then gives a read out of the binding interactions between many binding site peptides and a protein of interest in parallel in the presence and absence of a modulating factor. Applications include multiplexed drug screening of small molecule inhibitors with specific binding sites of interest. Advantages include full protein expression is not necessary, only binding site sequences are produced on beads. MRBLES use of lanthanides allows for a greater possible coding space given that they have narrow and well-separated emission spectra.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have synthesized a potential novel class of pain relief drugs. Traditional opioids, while highly effective for acute pain management, have historically been prescribed as long-term analgesic treatments despite their well-known addictive properties. Fully synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are even more potent than traditional opioids and have further fueled the opioid epidemic. Both synthetic and traditional opioids act as agonists against the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). Considering the far-reaching socioeconomic impacts of the opioid epidemic, new pain relief therapeutics are needed to quell further morbidity and mortality. In another vein, it has been shown that cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) are essential components of pain modulation. The inventors have discovered and characterized novel modulators of MOR and CB1. These compounds have the potential to act on the same biological systems as opioids with potentially reduced addictive properties. Additionally, these compounds have potential roles in treating opioid overdose. Some compounds disclosed in this patent are positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and some are negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of MOR. Rather than acting as direct agonists and binding to the binding site of these receptors, they bind at alternative locations on the protein to effect function. This provides a distinct benefit of these compounds over traditional or synthetic opioids in that molecules that bind at allosteric sites can signal more specifically through the MOR or CB1 to avoid off-target effects, including potential psychoactive effects. Applications include novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of acute and chronic pain and development of non-addictive medications for pain relief. Advantages include potentially less psychoactive or addictive effects when compared to currently available opioid medication and more specifically targeting receptors involved in pain modulation, reducing off-target effects.",

As this invention was genetically engineered to be hypoallergenic and also immunogenic, it only provokes anti-cancer immunity without inducing any undesired graft-verse-host diseases.

This technology involves a gold cluster-based nanocomplex serving as both the radiosensitizer and a gene vector carrying siRNA, specifically targeting the tumor marker protein Galectin-1. Cancer treatments often face the daunting obstacle of radio-resistance and immunosuppression, hindering the effectiveness of conventional therapies. Additionally, distant metastasis remains a critical concern, impacting long-term patient survival rates. This technology is designed to autonomously accumulate within tumor and metastatic niches, delivering its siRNA payload to knock down the radio-resistant Galectin-1 protein. Simultaneously, the gold atoms within the nano-complex generate cell-killing reactive oxygen species upon radiation treatment, promoting efficient tumor elimination. To further boost the systemic immune response, the gold nano-complex facilitates enhanced stereotactic body radiotherapy, leading to increased immunogenic cell death. Additionally, the clearance of immunosuppressive Galectin-1 supports long-term immune surveillance, preventing distant metastasis and improving overall survival rates. In tumor mouse models, the gold nano-complex showcased superior outcomes compared to radiation therapy alone or in combination with antibodies or inhibitors against Galectin-1, or cisplatin. Its multifaceted effects lead to prolonged survival rates and efficient prevention of metastasis, promising a new era in cancer treatment.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Mature pancreatic islets are the gold standard for transplantation-based approaches for islet replacement in type 1 and type 3c diabetes mellitus (T1D and T3cD), but this feature is offset by the scarcity of human cadaveric pancreas donors. Thus, global efforts are directed to develop replacement islets from renewable sources like human stem cell lines. Despite progress in this area, stem cell-derived replacement islets (SCRIs) lack functional maturation, and recent work has identified molecular, signaling and genetic features of this incomplete development. This includes evidence for GPCR-based signaling between islet cells during fetal development, and expression of crucial factors like the transcriptional regulators in normal human islet beta cell maturation. Islet development in humans and other vertebrates involves aggregation of individual islet cells into multicellular islets to produce heterogeneous clusters of beta, alpha, and delta cells, and other non-islet cell types. Thus, from their birth, interactions between islet cells likely guide islet development. However, the mechanisms of intra-islet signaling to foster human islet development and maturation remain poorly characterized. To address this knowledge gap, inventors at Stanford have exploited the use of pseudoislets to mix SCRI cells and native human islet cells to create mixed chimeras. By using molecular and electrophysiological assays, they showed that exposure of SCRI beta cells to native islet cells in such in vitro cell mixtures substantially enhances their molecular and functional maturation. The invention disperses cells from stem-cell-derived protocols, and mixes these with dispersed bona fide islet cells from adult donors (human or pig). They are then cultured briefly before being re-isolated into the stem cell-derived progeny resembling islet beta-cells. When re-isolated, these show improved features including production of maturity markers and improved function. These pseudoislets have been demonstrated to function and be transplantable in diabetic animals. The invention identifies a process to provide crucial signals for islet maturation and can be applied for development of replacement islet beta cells or other islet cell types. Applications: Stem cell-derived replacement islets for diabetes, Renewable human beta cells. Advantages: Retains key features of native human beta cells, including SIX2 and SIX3 production that stimulate beta function and specialization, Improved features including production of maturity markers and improved function, Biocompatible and transplantable in vivo.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed new lentiviral vectors that are able to deliver more genetic information than currently available vectors, aiding in the development of gene therapy. Gene therapy is one of the most promising therapeutic avenues in translational medicine. This method involves the genetic engineering of cells in living humans to replace dysfunctional or pathogenic versions of genes. Several methods have been proposed for delivering gene therapy in patients, one of which is lentiviral vectors (LVVs). Lentiviruses are a group of retroviruses that can insert parts of their genetic material into a host cell's genome, including non-dividing cells. While LVVs have many advantages for use in gene therapy, one caveat of this approach is the limited capacity of these vectors. LVVs have approximately an 8-12 kilobase (kb) payload, which limits their delivery capacity to 1-2 genes. This physical limitation attenuates LVVs effectiveness in clinical gene therapy settings in which a larger payload capacity is needed to resolve genetic mutations. The inventors have devised a strategy to produce LVVs with roughly double the payload capacity of those currently available. Wild-type LVVs have two identical or nearly identical gRNAs. However, the full capacity of these gRNAs was not able to be utilized due to dimerization interactions between the two gRNAs that result in dimer linkage structure that is integral to viral packaging. The inventors have designed LVV structures that allow for the combining of the two gRNAs such that interactions between like-gRNAs that would form homodimers are thermodynamically favored and stabilized, while interactions between unlike gRNAs that would form heterodimers are not thermodynamically favored and stabilized. Thus, these LVVs can form dimer linkage structures needed for viral packaging (homodimers) while avoiding heterodimers that would disrupt distinct sequences meant to be delivered as a payload into the genomes of human cells. Applications include use of increased-capacity LVVs for gene therapy in vivo and use of increased-capacity LVVs as research tools. Advantages include roughly double the payload capacity of LVVs used under current methods and increased payload capacity makes these LVVs for broad use in a myriad of biomedical applications that require more than 1-2 genes to be modified.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a new microparticle vaccine scaffold for the development of immunogenic subunit vaccines. Vaccines are one of the most important biomedical advances of the 20th century. Protein vaccines, often referred to as subunit vaccines, have proved to be a particularly useful vaccine strategy. Subunit vaccines have been licensed for the prevention of infectious diseases such as HPV, hepatitis B, and influenza. To assist immunogenicity, subunit vaccines are often administered with adjuvants, carrier proteins or nanoparticles. While these co-administered factors often help with immunogenicity, they often create problems for the scalability of these vaccines. The inventors have developed a new scaffolding method for eliciting immunogenicity in subunit vaccines. Specifically, the inventors devised strategies for the purification and conjugation of peptidoglycan (PGN) microparticles from several bacterial strains. PGN is easily purifiable, naturally immunogenic, and readily biodegradable, making it an ideal candidate as a vaccine scaffold. This system uses optimized Staphylococcus aureus PGN microparticles containing azido-D-alanine which is highly manipulatable and creates strong conjugations to immunogens of interest. Furthermore, these PGN microparticles conjugated to protein subunits yielded immunogenic responses similar to those of conventional carrier proteins such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). When PGN microparticles were conjugated to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV2, this subunit vaccine was shown to produce comparable neutralizing antibody titers to those produced by KLH-conjugated RBD, demonstrating the effectiveness of this novel vaccine scaffold. Applications: Novel protein scaffold for subunit vaccines. Advantages: PGN is readily biodegradable while maintaining robust immunogenicity. PGN microparticles are highly stable and comprise a scalable subunit vaccine conjugation platform.",

Lymphedema affects more than 200 million people in the world and currently has no approved pharmacological therapies. The Nicolls Lab's human and mouse lymphedema research demonstrated reduction of the lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling aggravates lymphedema by enhancing LEC adhesion and amplifying pathogenic CD4 T cell responses. The lab induced lymphedema in mice by surgically ligating the tail lymphatics. Lymphedematous dermal tissue was assessed for S1P signaling and animals were treated with a monoclonal antibody specific to P-selectin to assess efficacy in reducing lymphedema and T cell activation. P-selectin-directed antibody treatment improved tail swelling, decreased LEC S1P signaling through S1PR1, reduced Th1/Th2 immune responses in mouse lymphedema, and human and experimental lymphedema tissues LEC S1P signaling through S1PR1decreased. This study describes how lymphedema-associated immune dysregulation may be linked to reduced LEC S1P signaling and how P-selectin inhibitors, already approved for use in other diseases, may be effective in this otherwise refractory condition.

To combat this issue, Stanford researchers have developed chemically modified AAV vectors which display an unnatural amino acid on the capsid surface. As a proof of concept, Stanford researchers used an azido-lysine as the unnatural amino acid displayed on the capsid. The azido (N3) group allows for a simple click chemistry reaction with any molecule that contains a dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) chemical group.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a wearable patch that allows for continuous mental health monitoring via electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. EEG technology was developed during the advent of neuroscience nearly a century and a half ago. EEG technology works by recording and analyzing surface electrical signals on more than a dozen sites on the human head. These signals correspond to electrical impulses sent by groups of neurons in the cortex, which is the outermost layer of the brain. In the modern day, EEG is used to diagnose many neurological conditions including epilepsy, sleep disorders, and other psychiatric conditions. While very useful in medical practice, EEG technology has drawbacks, including the use of heavy or bulky wires to deploy multiple electrodes. This caveat makes the use of EEG for long-term neurological monitoring impractical using currently available technology due to discomfort caused by bulky equipment. The inventors have developed a lightweight, wearable patch that can record EEG signals. This patch contains one or more electrodes that record electrical signals produced by neurons in the cortex. The patch also contains an analog digital converter (ADC) to record the signals picked up by the electrodes. Subsequently, the ADC then passes along these signals to a digital controller which is configured to encode EEG data into a single-bit series so it can be transmitted effectively. Finally, the patch then transmits signals through a radio frequency (RF) transmitter to an external receiver where they can be analyzed. Applications include long-term monitoring of numerous neurological and mental health conditions by EEG, and enabling further research into recordable electrical patterns detectable by EEG that may provide additional diagnostic methods for neurological or mental health conditions. Advantages include being lightweight, weighing only a single gram as well as relatively small (approximately the size of a penny), and the patch format allows this technology to be wearable, which in turn allows long-term monitoring with little quality of life disruption to patients as compared to currently available technology which is bulky and requires wires.",

    "ip_description": "Amyloid ? (A?) is a key protein involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A key property of A? that is now believed to be at the core of its toxicity in AD is its ability to form soluble, toxic oligomers. Targeting such oligomers remains a promising avenue for AD therapeutic development. It has been found that 1:1 equimolar LL-37/A?40 mixtures are totally prevented from forming A? fibrils, while lower relative molar amounts of LL-37 slow the kinetics of fibril formation; and in this patent, a synthetic peptoid mimic of LL-37 is also shown to bind A?. It has also become clear that sporadic AD (not resulting from a unique familial predisposition to disease) is either caused by or accompanied by the occurrence of polymicrobial brain infections and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Certain oral pathogens that are associated with dementia\u2014including Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG), Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) and Candida albicans\u2014can be killed or inactivated by the LL-37 peptide, which is produced by the human innate immune system, as well as by peptoid mimics of LL-37 described in this patent. Although A?:LL-37 interactions offer an interesting starting point in the development of new therapeutic approaches that block A? aggregation and toxicity, the relatively complex, poorly understood, pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects of LL-37, as well as its relatively high molecular weight (~4500 g/mol, 37 amino acids) and extreme vulnerability to cleavage by proteases, are substantially disadvantageous features from the standpoint of using the peptide as an exogenous AD therapeutic. Thus, a biostable peptoid mimic of LL-37 is more promising. It was recently discovered that certain peptoid mimics of LL-37 share the same anti-amyloid activity of the peptide, while also exhibiting potent antimicrobial and antiviral activity against both P. gingivalis, HSV-1, and C. albicans. Thus, these peptoids have the potential to be developed as antimicrobial treatments that may also serve as anti-amyloid treatments.",

However, the manufacturing techniques remain time-intensive and low-throughput for large-scale production of TCOs via traditional vacuum-based deposition (i.e., sputtering). The scientists at Stanford developed a novel open-air and scalable TCO synthesis technique that is time-efficient, highly tunable, and environmentally friendly. The chloride-free combustion synthesis uses an open-air ultrasonic spray or other solution casting technique to deposit the coating, and then anneals rapidly to generate an amorphous or crystalline oxide depending on the curing temperature. Then, an open-air plasma is used to tune the film conductivity. This method gives high throughput, requires low temperature deposition for amorphous oxide generation, and simultaneously achieves high conductivity. This technique significantly reduces the cost of fabrication of TCO and improves the efficiency of production without sacrificing for its conductivity.",

Scintillators, used in PET imaging, are materials that convert high-energy radiation into low-energy photons in the UV-Vis region. An ultrafast scintillator can largely improve the coincidence timing window (CTR) and allow for better signal localization. Current state-of-the-art scintillators have decay constants of 200ns-1000ns.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have developed a new approach for proximity labeling via optogenetic control. Allosteric regulation is common in naturally occurring enzymes in living tissues. However, despite its ability to improve spatial and temporal control, allostery has yet to be used extensively in artificially engineered enzymes. One artificially engineered enzyme, TurboID, achieves broad proximity-dependent biotinylation. While Turbo is useful for mapping interactomes and organelle proteomes both in vivo and in vitro, one important drawback is that Turbo's substrate, biotin, is endogenously expressed in most tissues of living organisms. This endogenous expression severely limits its temporal specificity. Furthermore, poor genetic integration and targeting can additionally contribute to the limited spatial specificity of Turbo and other proximity labeling enzymes. This limitation can be highly dependent on cell type, cellular compartment, and proteins of interest. Further methods are needed to improve the spatial specificity of proximity labeling via Turbo. The inventors have developed a light-regulated version of Turbo, dubbed LOV-Turbo. This enzyme was engineered through a combination of structure-guided design, screening and directed evolution to express a light-dependent domain. LOV-Turbo has virtually undetectable activity in darkness but activates within seconds of weak blue light illumination. Additionally, LOV-Turbo has an extremely wide dynamic range even in the presence of high amounts of biotin. The inventors have proven in a peer-reviewed study that this enzyme can efficiently and accurately perform proximity labeling in yeast, bacteria, and the mouse brain. This is especially impressive considering that neurons have a relatively high burden of biotin and are therefore more prone to confounding background noise in the original TurboID system. The applications of LOV-Turbo are vast, exciting, and represent a step forward in the field of enzyme engineering. Applications include enhanced spatial and temporal specificity when compared to other proximity-labeling enzymes, the ability to perform pulse-chase experiments to explore protein shuttling between different cellular compartments, and activation by the luciferase NanoLuc via BRET to selectively biotinylate protein subcomplexes. Advantages include comparable activity to the original TurboID enzyme, increased temporal and spatial specificity when compared to other proximity labeling enzymes, and additional avenues for the interrogation of cellular and molecular biology.",

    "ip_number": "S21-067",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed an innovation that will enhance the depth of the imaging capabilities for optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Optical coherence tomography is a technique for visualizing various medias that was originally developed in the 1990s for the imaging of ocular measurements. This technique is of clinical significance due to its ability to image tissue morphology at a much higher resolution than other clinical imaging techniques such as MRI. OCT provides what are effectively 'optical ultrasound' images by directing an optical beam at a tissue of interest. A fraction of this light will then be reflected from sub-surface features of the tissue and subsequently recorded to create a digital reconstruction of the sub-surface tissue morphology. The key advantage of this technique is its high resolution and lack of ionizing radiation due to its use of light as a reflective source rather than sound or radio frequency. Despite advancements in the field of OCT imaging, improved methods to extend the depth of focus in these systems represents a major unmet medical need. The inventors have developed new methods of creating needle-shaped beams to extend the depth of focus in OCT imaging systems. Briefly, a diffractive optical element with a predetermined phase profile is used to create a single beam with multiple foci along the axial direction of propagation. This then produces a beam that has both a large depth of focus and a narrow diameter. This needle shaped beam can then be used in a myriad of optical imaging and analysis systems. While other OCT systems utilize multiple beams, they fail to achieve the same extended depth that the inventor's system does without considerable draw backs. The inventor's system provides the capability to extend the depth of focus of imaging in an OCT system while maintaining lateral resolution along the depth of the image, allowing for an increased depth of focus without sacrificing a wide field of view. Applications include increased depth of focus imaging for clinical applications such as ocular imaging and increased depth of focus imaging for preclinical applications such as improved depth of imaging in animal models that require non-invasive imaging techniques. Advantages include maintaining OCT systems' non-invasive imaging method and extending the depth of focus of current OCT systems without sacrificing on lateral field of view.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed compounds that act as potent anti-cancer drugs which selectively inhibit CDK19 over CDK8 and promise a greater therapeutic index and reduced systemic toxicity. Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. Patient mortality rates have been decreasing due to earlier detection methods and screening of genetic biomarkers associated with at-risk populations. However, targeted therapeutic strategies have not advanced to an equal extent, in particular against patients diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a particularly aggressive and invasive cancer subtype and the only therapeutic intervention available to these patients is chemotherapy, which is known to be non-specific, highly toxic, and therefore limited. In addition, patients diagnosed with TNBC often experience worse survival outcomes than patients with other types of breast cancer. Cyclin-dependent kinase 19 (CDK19) and a related isoform CDK8 are oncogenic transcription-related kinases that play a role in certain cancers, including TNBC. Compounds that non-selectively inhibit CDK19 and CDK8 have been explored for their anti-cancer properties but have shown to have undesirable side effects due to the CDK8 inhibition, which is more widely-distributed in tissues than CDK19. Therefore, there remains a need for compounds which selectively inhibit CDK19 over CDK8, as well as new methods of treating cancers such as TNBC that comprise administering such compounds. The inventors have developed compounds that are inhibitors of CDK19. Inhibition of CDK19 has been shown to be effective against breast cancer, including TNBC. The disclosed compounds bind to and inhibit the activity of CDK19, and selectively inhibit CDK19 over CDK8, thereby minimizing or avoiding side effects caused by targeting CDK8, for example gastrointestinal side effects. Applications: The compounds described herein can be used to inhibit CDK19 activity, and thus can be used to treat conditions mediated by CDK19, such as cancers with aberrant CDK19 activity. Suitable cancers which can be treated include but are not limited to breast cancer, prostate cancer, cancer of the gastrointestinal tract, bladder cancer, sarcoma, cervical cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma, glioma and ovarian cancer. Combination therapy with a compound described herein with another suitable therapeutic agent including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, surgery and a combination thereof. Advantages: The compounds described herein selectively inhibit CDK19 over CDK8. CDK8 is more widespread in the body's tissue and thereby targeting CDK8 causes more unintended side effects.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of RNA viral infections. Myriad advances in the field of infectious diseases have been made in the last century, including the development of antibiotics and the widespread use of vaccines. While vaccines offer a powerful tool for prophylaxis against viral (and some bacterial) infections, there is a dearth of treatments available to those who are already infected with a specific virus. Anti-retroviral therapy is a notable exception to this rule, with anti-polymerase and anti-proteinase pharmaceuticals comprising an incredibly effective strategy in controlling viral replication of HIV. However, these treatments remain costly and unavailable to most people worldwide despite nearly 40 years on the market. Additional therapeutic strategies are needed to adequately address RNA viral infections worldwide. The inventors discovered that circular RNAs (cRNAs) that are encoded in RNA viral genomes can have pro-viral effects. In this vein, they have developed methods to inhibit cRNAs that have been identified as pro-viral and can therefore hamper viral replication in human cells. These methods include siRNA or shRNAs that target the cRNAs, an RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas system, or a small molecule. These methods can be used in both infected and bystander cells. Furthermore, the inventors also discovered specific cRNAs that act on host proteins to dampen the innate immune response in cells, therefore allowing excess viral replication. In turn, the inventors provide additional methods of viral replication impediment in the form of inhibiting these cRNAs that inhibit the innate immune response in cells, and therefore allows the host's own immune system to respond more effectively to a viral infection. Applications include treatment of RNA virus infections by limiting replication of the virus and/or promoting greater effectiveness of the hosts immune system to eliminate the virus. Advantages include that this method encompasses both nuclear RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses and coronaviruses, as well as nuclear RNA viruses, such as influenza or retroviruses, and provides additional therapeutic targets in the treatment of RNA viral infections which comprises an urgent unmet medical need.",

Cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in blood plasma samples enables dynamic and longitudinal phenotyping for physiological conditions spanning oncology, bone marrow transplants, obstetrics, neurodegeneration and liver disease. Liquid biopsies that measure cfRNA afford broad clinical utility as these transcripts can reflect the health status of multiple tissue types. Most current assays focus on tissue-level contributions when trying to identify the cell types of origin of these cfRNA transcripts, however cell-level identity would be even more powerful for identifying the cellular pathophysiology contributing to the formation of the disease. In addition, this level of analysis would more closely match the resolution provided by invasive biopsy procedures. The inventors have developed a method to identify cell types of origin for cfRNA from liquid biopsies. This method uses the Tabula Sapiens transcriptomic cell atlas as well as individual tissue transcriptomic cell atlases in combination with the Human Protein Atlas RNA consensus data set. The method identifies cell type signature scores, which allow for the inference of cell types that contribute to cfRNA for a variety of diseases. Applications include integration of tissue-of-origin and single cell transcriptomics to identify cell-types-of-origin of cfRNA, and non-invasive resolution of cellular pathophysiology with cfRNA.

Coronaviruses cause human illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. They are large, enveloped, and covered in surface 'Spike' glycoproteins that interact with host cell receptors to mediate host cell entry. To date, there are a limited number of active pharmaceutical agents that have any clinical effect in treating coronavirus-infected patients. COVID-19 therapeutics are limited to small molecules alone or in combination with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and with the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that have been identified, only one clinically available mAb retained activity suitable for use against the Omicron variant. Omicron has a larger mutational profile than previous variants of concern, thereby treatment of Omicron infections and subsequent novel future strains will require the development of broad-spectrum therapeutic agents. The inventors have developed fusion proteins and modified proteins comprising a neutralizing polypeptide and an antibody (e.g., a non-neutralizing antibody) that binds to an epitope in a conserved region of one or more coronavirus spike proteins. The fusion proteins and modified proteins can specifically bind to and neutralize a broad spectrum of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and all known SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). Applications: The fusion proteins described herein demonstrate neutralizing activity against all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) tested, including Omicron and BA.2. Bi-functional fusion proteins containing two non-neutralizing antibodies with non-overlapping epitopes demonstrate sub-nano molar neutralization against all VOCs tested.

Treatments like methadone offer a path to recovery for heroin addiction, but are burdened with high relapse rates, strict governmental oversight, and continued abuse potential, highlighting the need for non-opioid alternatives. Cannabis derivatives offer a possible treatment for opioid dependence. Rodent studies from Stanford's Shamloo and Barron laboratories suggest that the CB2 cannabinoid receptor is a meditator of the anti-addictive properties of cannabis derivatives. Selective targeting of the CB2 receptor- while avoiding the psychoactive effects of the CB1 receptor- can therefore be a viable strategy for the treatment of opioid use disorder. The inventors have designed a library of agonists for the CB2 receptor that maximize selectivity without activating CB1. As a result, the compounds minimize the psychoactive effects of cannabinoid use, while maximizing the mitigation of addiction behaviors. Beyond opioid use dependence, the compound library also has applications in pain relief and management, inflammatory disorders, and neuroinflammation. Applications: Treatment for opioid use dependence, pain management, inflammatory diseases, stroke, neuroinflammation, and animal models of opioid addiction. Advantages: Non-opioid option for addiction treatment, avoids psychoactive effects of cannabis derivatives, non-addictive option for pain relief.",

    "ip_description": "Immune checkpoint blockade, a class of immunotherapy treatment which works by blocking inhibitory receptors on T cells to improve immune responses, has proven to be a remarkable clinical advance in the treatment of many diseases, particularly in cancer. However, most patients do not benefit from checkpoint blockade, and many of those who do eventually experience progression of disease. While the use of immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized cancer treatment, there is a need for greater mechanistic understanding of how checkpoint blockade works in patients. Recent studies have suggested that the success of immune checkpoint blockade may be related to the expansion of a population of T cells known as progenitor exhausted T cells. This population of progenitor exhausted T cells is known to express the inhibitory receptor PD-1 and the transcription factor TCF1. However, TCF1 is not expressed on the cell surface, making it difficult to target. Furthermore, there is no validated way to target these progenitor exhausted T cells in humans, as most studies have been performed in mice. Thus, there is an unmet need for more markers that can specifically identify progenitor exhausted T cells in humans. Doing so could enable the selective targeting and activation of the exhausted T cell population, potentially leading to improved patient responses to immune checkpoint blockade. Inventors at Stanford have profiled the T cell compartment of patients with lung cancer using single-cell-paired RNA and T cell receptor sequencing methods at high depth and regional resolution. They have identified a population of progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells in the lymph node of patients that are clonally linked to terminally exhausted T cells in the tumor. Additionally, by performing antigen specificity assays, the inventors found that this progenitor exhausted T cell population comprises a subset of tumor antigen-specific T cells, suggesting they are involved in the tumor response. Computational analysis identified several genes that preferentially mark these lymph node progenitor exhausted T cells, including CCL5, CMC1, EOMES, IL32, SIRPG, RARRES3, CST7, GZMM, and PDIA3. This invention can enable methods that can specifically target progenitor exhausted T cells in humans to modulate this population for clinical benefit. Applications: Immunology research, Selective targeting and activation of progenitor T cell population during immune checkpoint blockade treatment, Immunotherapy. Advantages: There is currently no clinical standard for targeting these progenitor exhausted T cells in humans.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have created ligand-induced dimerization activating RNA editing (LIDAR), a versatile molecular sensor that turns the presence of a ligand into translation of an output protein. Despite success in the development of synthetic receptors, most are not compatible with currently available therapeutic application systems, or the systems are difficult to use and their requirements impede many in vivo applications. The LIDAR system consists of three core components: an mRNA and two fusion proteins that dimerize upon the presence of a ligand. The first fusion protein enables strong and specific binding to the mRNA. The other fusion protein contains a catalytic domain that is placed in close proximity to the mRNA, enabling editing of the mRNA and allowing translation of an output (protein) coding sequence on the mRNA.\n\nThere are three classes of LIDAR sensors with the same core mechanism of activation: cLIDAR with a cytosolic ligand, eLIDAR with an extracellular ligand but intracellular components, and tLIDAR with an extracellular ligand whose detection is mediated by a natural receptor, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). LIDAR can detect most extracellular ligands that have a natural receptor including small molecules, peptides, and proteins. The input could also be synthetic, allowing for detection of most proteins that can be bound by antibodies, natural binding domains, or small molecules that can trigger dimerization of a protein pair. LIDAR is also capable of sensing intangible external stimuli, such as light or magnet fields. Multiple inputs could also be detected at the same time with multiple distinct outputs or conditional outputs. LIDAR can further directly interface with RADAR technology to detect both an mRNA of interest and a protein of interest. The output could be any protein that is able to be encoded on a single mRNA transcript.\n\nApplications:\n- Can be integrated into natural signaling cascades or synthetic circuits for precise tuning of complex cellular functions\n- Can enable detection of both cell type (as defined by mRNAs in the cell) and the surrounding state (as defined by proteins, peptides, or small molecules inside or outside the cell)\n- Could be applied as the basis of next-generation cell therapies such as CAR-T\n- Could be applied in cell engineering applications, allowing for markerless selection of cells for purification or to screen for increased protein production\n\nAdvantages:\n- Leverages RNA editing to exert function, a feature that no existing synthetic receptors possess\n- Can incorporate signals from an expanded set of inputs not accessible with current technologies\n- Can be delivered wholly by RNA, which broadens potential delivery strategies and enables in vivo delivery\n- Response time would be much faster than synthetic receptors that rely on transcription factors\n- Can be built upon completely humanized components, which is much safer and more compatible with in vivo applications\n- Can be built upon a variety of receptor architectures (cLIDAR, eLIDAR and tLIDAR)",

Although it is known that epicardial cells on the surface of the heart give rise to coronary artery smooth muscle deep in the myocardium, the differentiation steps between the epicardium and mature smooth muscle were previously unknown. Inventors at Stanford discovered that pericytes, mural cells closely associated with small blood vessels, are epicardial-derived progenitors for coronary artery smooth muscle. Pericytes is a new potential cell type for cell therapy that could be used for vascular regeneration, revascularization after an infarct, or vascular malformation.\n\nThe Red-Horse Lab have developed a method of providing smooth muscle cells to a tissue where they are needed. The invention involves creating an isolated population of epicardial-derived pericytes and providing the pericytes to the tissue of interest. The epicardial-derived pericytes then differentiate into smooth muscle cells that express smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. The pericytes are lineage committed but not as matured as smooth muscle cells, making them the ideal cell type to inject and induce angiogenesis within new tissues. This invented method also paves the way for pericytes to act as a drug target for vascular abnormalities in particular diseases which involve deregulated smooth muscle or deregulated pericytes.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   -Drug target for vascular diseases involving abnormal pericyte/smooth muscle deregulation.\n*   -Cell therapy applications where injected pericytes could induce angiogenesis in devascularized regions of all tissues in the body or replace lost smooth muscle on diseased vessels.\n*   -Smooth muscle angiogenesis\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   -lineage traced the intermediate step of pericytes differentiating into smooth muscle cells and obtained evidence for this differentiation pathway using 2 transgenic mouse models\n*   -Pericytes are lineage committed but not as matured as smooth muscle cells, making them the ideal cell type to inject and induce angiogenesis within new tissues",

    "ip_description": "The Stanford Sarafan ChEM-H Medicinal Chemistry Knowledge Center has developed a novel aqueous solubilizing promoiety (Sol-moiety) that can be readily attached to a wide-range of functional groups and undergo controlled cleavage to improve the pharmacokinetic profile of a desired therapeutic. Solubility has long been a challenge for medicinal chemists as they develop increasingly more potent and selective molecules with hydrophobic character. This invention allows for rapid improvement in the solubility of drug prototypes that possess a free amino or hydroxyl group. The Solmoiety is attached to the drug and then cleaved in the presence of phosphatases in the intestine or plasma, allowing drug prototypes to be delivered orally or intravenously. The technology has been applied to several well-known drugs, including Enzalutamide and Vemurafenib, where excellent oral bioavailability was achieved using saline solution as a vehicle in mouse pharmacokinetic experiments. Sol-moiety technology has also enabled the oral bioavailability of drugs that are traditionally administered through intravenous infusion, such as Paclitaxel. The Sol-moiety platform has the potential to replace sophisticated formulation strategies currently used in the pharmaceutical industry, improve insoluble drug prototypes or marketed drugs that are thwarted by poor PK, and provide patients with a more convenient administration of highly potent therapeutics.\n\nApplications:\n* Can be applied to drug prototypes with a free amino or hydroxyl group that lack sufficient solubility\n* Can be applied to drug prototypes with a free amino or hydroxyl group wherein oral delivery would be superior to intravenous delivery\n\nAdvantages:\n* Improves oral bioavailability beyond standard prodrug technology\n* Allows drug prototypes to be delivered orally or intravenously\n* Wider scope than traditional methods",

Other parameters such as stimulation frequency and pulse width can subsequently be set to target specific neuronal cell-types or circuits within the brain.

Application of this new strategy is described in Stanford docket S22-403 'Solving brain circuit function and dysfunction with computational modeling and optogenetic fMRI'. Applications include neurostimulation therapy based on cell-type and brain circuit targeting, and commercial application is to read brain's pathology via imaging and apply an algorithm to predict pathology, optimizing design of therapy.

In response, Bassik Lab and Bintu Lab researchers applied a high-throughput approach to discover and characterize effector domains at a 1000-fold larger scale than previous efforts.

It does so by inhibiting growth of Borrelia burgdorferi, the main causative agent of Lyme disease. Approximately 1 in 7 people worldwide currently have or have had Lyme disease, with prevalence highest in Central Europe, East Asia, and Western Europe. The standard of care is antibiotic treatment, from which most patients make a full recovery. However, between 5 \u2013 20% of patients report persistent physical and/or neurological symptoms after antibiotic treatment. These mechanisms for disease persistence, as well as biological risk factors, remain poorly understood. The inventors discovered that a mutation to the gene encoding a human secretoglobin protein reduced the inhibition of Borrelia burgdorferi growth, and increased the susceptibility to Lyme Disease. This invention, therefore, identifies a novel target for therapeutic intervention, both prophylactically and to potentially treat late-stage Lyme disease. Applications include treatment of Lyme Disease (e.g. recombinant protein therapy, gene editing, small molecule agonists, etc.), possible treatment of late-stage Lyme Disease, and prophylactic in high-risk areas/populations (especially those carrying the missense variant to the human secretoglobin gene).

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists in Chris Garcia's lab have developed leptin analogs that have potentially more favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacological signaling properties for use as diabetes and obesity drugs. Excess body weight is a primary underlying risk factor for a variety of human diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and several types of cancer. Although a variety of dietary and pharmacological interventions have emerged in the past several decades to combat obesity, therapeutics capable of safely promoting significant and sustained weight loss are still needed. Leptin is a hormone that plays a critical role in regulating energy balance and body weight. When functioning properly, leptin suppresses hunger and increases energy expenditure, helping to maintain a stable body weight. Previous attempts to use leptin as a drug have been disappointing in part due to Leptin resistance and high serum leptin levels in obese patients also present an obstacles to the efficacy of wild-type-leptin-based drugs. This invention describes engineered leptin variants that function as high affinity biased agonists, thereby decoupling activation of the anorexigenic LepR-STAT3 pathway from pathways associated with leptin resistance. Together with additional modifications that enhance the solubility and stability of these variants, these leptin analogs could overcome the challenges of the native Leptin protein and lead to novel pharmacological outcomes that help overcome leptin resistance. Applications: Therapeutics for obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia.

Lower muscle mass across large human cohorts has been strongly associated with higher incidence of obesity, worsened diabetes and metabolic disease, frailty in the elderly, and even increased mortality. A class of peptide ligands that regulate muscle mass are growth hormone (GH) secretagogues. These peptide agonists act in the pituitary to increase GH secretion, leading to downstream activation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) and IGF1-mediated anabolic pathways. GH secretagogues have attracted considerable therapeutic potential as anti-frailty and anti-cachexic agents, while also being explored for growth retardation, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and cardiometabolic disease.\n\nInventors at Stanford have devised a genomic prediction algorithm to identify candidate pyroglutamyl amidated peptides that might be hidden within existing genomic sequences. By applying this algorithm to the mouse and human genomes, they have identified candidate peptides sequences with both N- and C-terminal posttranslational modifications that are 100% conserved between the two species. A subset of the synthetic peptides corresponding to these predicted sequences exhibit robust GH secretagogue activity in vitro. The inventors showed robust detection of these peptides in mouse plasma, establishing their endogenous presence. Furthermore, they have obtained evidence for a receptor-based mechanism of action that is independent of the classical GHS receptor and GHRH receptor pathways.

    "ip_description": "A Stanford researcher has designed an artificial lens capsule as a drug delivery device inserted at the time of cataract surgery, to address issues of extended drug delivery to the eye with minimal complications. Extended drug delivery to the eye addresses clinical burden as well as non-compliance with eye drop regimens, low ocular absorption with drops, and the risks and burdens of intravitreal injections on patients. There are currently extended release steroid implants for the posterior segment of the eye. Recently, there was a novel drug delivery device for extended anti-VEGF medication, which involved a refillable intraocular reservoir with a diffusion filter to allow for extended release. However, due to the nature of the surgery during implantation, there are side effects including a 2% endophthalmitis rate, 5.2% vitreous hemorrhage, 3.6% conjunctival erosion, and 5.9% conjunctival bleb. This limits clinical adoptability. The lens capsule is a safe space in the eye and has an extensive safety profile for implanted intraocular lenses. Stanford researchers propose using a drug delivery scaffold for implantation in the lens capsule at the time of cataract surgery, which is known as a safe surgery with very low surgical complications. This drug delivery scaffold is used to hold the new intraocular lens at the time of cataract surgery. In addition, it contains a valved drug delivery reservoir with a diffusion filter to allow extended drug delivery. The lens capsule is between the anterior and posterior segments of the eye and will allow for extended drug delivery to the anterior chamber for anterior medications such as glaucoma medication, antibiotics, and steroids. It will also allow extended drug delivery to the posterior chamber with medications targeting the retina, such as anti-VEGF medications, complement inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and chemotherapy medications. The researchers believe that this drug delivery scaffold can use known technology such as extended drug delivery through a refillable reservoir to provide extended drug delivery to either the anterior or posterior chamber of the eye with low surgical complications. The drug delivery scaffold holds the intraocular lens that is implanted during cataract surgery and allows for safe intraocular lens exchange. This may benefit patients desiring an upgrade of their premium intraocular lens, or for patients with shifting refractions, such as the pediatric population.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Active manipulation of light beams is required for a range of emerging optical technologies, including sensing, optical computing, virtual/augmented reality, dynamic holography, and computational imaging. Miniaturization of these optical components is key to facilitating their integration into a range of applications. Despite many advances, the size and weight of traditional macroscopic lenses and dynamic optical elements still take up significant space due to their use of classic optical elements. Therefore, it is highly desirable to reduce the size and weight of the dynamic optical components in such systems. Subwavelength control over the phase using ordered arrays of nanoantennae, or metasurfaces, could allow this goal to be achieved. Tunable metasurface lenses have been realized and typically use strain or thermal tuning of the entire metasurface or mechanical movement between metasurface lenses. Recent efforts have demonstrated impressive modulation of phase and color of pixel elements that could be individually actuated with high-speed microelectromechanical MEMs technology. However, these are challenging to fabricate and experience limitations in dynamic applications due to vibration instability.\n\nInventors at Stanford have created a hybrid polymer/metal tunable optical metasurface system, with operation in wavelength ranges from the visible to the infrared. It can reversibly tune the color and phase of reflected wavefronts through applications of stimuli, including applied voltage or application of suitable fluids to the surface of the metasurface. The tuning mechanism is non-volatile, involving changes in polymer thickness due to changes in thermodynamic equilibrium condition. . In the case of fluidic control, the fluid infiltrates into the polymer and causes a change in the swelling degree. In the case of electrochemical control, applied voltage leads to ion intercalation, modifying the swelling degree. Depending on the specific design chosen, this can result in a change of the reflected color from the metasurface, continuous tuning of the direction of the reflected beam, or on-off modulation between different diffraction orders. These ultra-thin devices can also be made with thicknesses of 500nm, much smaller than conventional optical elements that range from the millimeter to centimeter scale. Nanoscale optical elements, combined with rapid advances in electrical control systems, or microfluidic systems infrastructure, could enable the next generation of optical elements light control.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   low power optical modulators, reconfigurable optical devices (including reconfigurable lensing and display), and sensing systems directly integrated into nano/microfluidic systems.\n*   Microfluidic systems and existing technologies\n*   any dynamically tunable focusing devices\n*   virtual/augmented reality devices\n*   wearable optical systems\n*   use in color display elements (such as Kindles)\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   can be integrated with electrical control methods (including low voltage CMOS chips), and patterned to allow for discrete pixelated control\n*   can be integrated with existing microfluidics technology\n*   system can be made ultracompact and avoids the use of complex mechanics\n*   could be apply to flat, wavelength specific, dynamically tunable focusing devices, which require no power upon moving to a new focus state\n*   Response times of 100ms could be of benefit to high throughput systems\n*   Use of liquid and electrochemical tuning allows for reliable and durable operation without typical mechanical wear\n*   Can be directly integrated into microfluidic system for inline sensing of system parameters, including potentially concentrations of biomolecules (e.g. with modifications of the polymer)",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have developed Schottky contacts for aluminum nitride-based microelectronic devices. The contacts enable reliable device operation at up to 600 \u00baC, opening up opportunities for high temperature microelectronic performance. Microelectronics capable of operating reliably at high temperature are necessary to provide sensing, readout, and telecommunications for applications in the space, aerospace, defense, automotive, and oil and gas sectors. Typical microelectronics produced for commercial, industrial, and military grade electronics, can often only perform reliably at temperatures up to 125 \u00baC. Above these temperatures, semiconductors fail to meet critical parameters and degradation can cause permanent failure. Aluminum nitride (AlN)-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) that leverage the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) have shown promise for high temperature operations. However, the reliability is often limited by the degradation of accompanying metallization and passivation layers. This technology provides a Schottky gate material as a passivation layer on AlN that can enable reliable high-temperature operation of AlN-based HEMTs. By oxidizing iridium on the AlN surface, devices fabricated with the material have demonstrated increased stability at high temperatures. Specifically, well-known degradation mechanisms in AlN-based devices, such as metal diffusion or electromigration during electrical characterization, are absent even at temperatures up to 600 \u00baC. Thus, the material offers promise in application to a variety of AlN-based devices where high temperature performance is essential. Applications include supercritical CO2 well leak detection in carbon capture and storage processes, industrial under-the-hood automotive and aircraft engine applications, uncooled downhole sensor readout for processes in the oil and gas industry, gas turbines, hypersonic structures, and aerospace missions such as to the surface of Venus (surface temperature 465 \u00baC). Advantages include being free from deleterious strain relaxation effects at high temperature that have been demonstrated to lower the 2DEG density and adversely affect device performance in AlGaN based devices, and offering higher electron mobilities so they are better for high frequency, high temperature applications compared to silicon carbide-based devices.",

One of the current challenges in neuroscience is to understand molecular identity, activity level and circuit wiring of individual cells within intact brain networks. Methods to investigate neuronal networks in intact tissues have been developed but are not optimal. For instance, these methods have used antibody staining for molecular analysis. This is costly and has a low success rate. In addition, these approaches may not be compatible with RNA detection and thus a wealth of biological information is left behind. There is a need to develop additional methods to visualize neuronal networks including the RNA in intact tissues. To help meet this need the inventors developed this technology which provides methods for fixation and detection of RNA in transparent intact tissues.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at CZ Biohub SF and Stanford University have developed a new disease management system that enables efficient population-level tracking of disease incidence rates. In recent years, the risk of pandemics has become much more visible to the public. As a result of ongoing international development and our ever-growing proximity to populations of wild animals, viral zoonotic jumps from animals to humans are becoming more and more common. As we continue to encroach on the natural habitats of many species, including those known to be reservoir species for zoonotic viruses including bats and pigs, pandemics caused by novel viral species are almost certainly inevitable. This widespread occurrence has huge global health implications, and therefore it is an urgent unmet medical need to develop plug-and-play pandemic readiness systems. It is impossible to predict what virus or family of viruses will jump from animals to humans next, but the need to be prepared for these events is more prescient than ever. Diagnostic testing is a key component of managing these outbreaks. However, testing every person in a population daily is unwieldly, expensive, and ultimately not feasible. The inventors have developed a low-cost and efficient disease management system to allow entities to track disease incidences in a set population. This technique enables virtually any organization, from schools to employers to public health departments to track disease incidence and allows them to respond in real time to outbreaks. This program uses remote self-collection via nasopharyngeal swabs for convenience and efficient use. Participants are first screened for eligibility and asked to take a survey about their background and initial health. Selected participants then have a home self-testing kit delivered to them with samples picked up for laboratory analysis. Participants also undergo ongoing symptom surveillance via daily surveys that alert and trigger repeat testing. Through this targeted and convenient testing strategy, this platform provides algorithms to test both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals to allow for accurate population-level estimates of real time disease incidences. Participants receive the results of this testing directly on a private, secure website. Applications: Testing and evaluation of disease incidence rates in specific populations in real time, Screening individuals for symptoms on a daily basis to limit the spread of disease. Advantages: Testing strategies for both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, Ongoing symptom surveillance throughout your population in order to ensure that those experiencing symptoms undergo testing as soon as possible, limiting the spread of disease, Scalable on a population level.",

High dimensional (HD) data is commonplace in biomedicine and industry today. With this wave of large omic (genomic, proteomic, among others) datasets, novel analysis techniques, including dimensionality reduction, discriminant analysis, Bayesian classification, decision trees, and neural networks, have been developed to extract and understand important information contained in HD data. However, HD data contain multi-level information with complex relationships, and its maximal exploitation is challenging. Current methods attempt to make sense of HD data by embedding them directly onto a low dimension without explicitly considering the underlying biological characteristics of the dataset. Stanford scientists, therefore, developed a method called genomap that transforms HD data into an ordered format that allows maximization of information of specific omics data interactions, like gene-gene interactions and enables deep exploration of the resulting information by advanced signal processing techniques such as multidimensional convolution filtering. They tested this approach on various gene expression datasets and showed that it vastly improves the performance of analyses compared to existing methods. Applications include tabular HD data analysis for various applications including industrial product development and scientific research in drug discovery, genomic analysis, data classification and clustering, sensor data analysis, disease detection, marketing and finance data analysis, social media, telecommunication, etc. Advantages include being the first of its kind, transforming tabular data into a configured data format, using image processing techniques on tabular data for extracting high level information, and being applicable to a wide variety of HD data.",

Droplet microfluidics systems rely on creating droplets within a carrier, immiscible fluid, and are widely used in analytical detection in biomedical research and the clinic. Multiplexing droplet multiplexed systems is useful for increasing throughput and required for some custom assays, and several strategies have been implemented. These include multiple fluorescence dyes (e.g., using multiple emission wavelengths and color filters), barcoding of droplets using barcoded particles, and barcoding using gel beads containing barcoded synthetic DNA. When samples are labeled by color, a one-to-one relationship between color and a particle or reaction is common, limiting the degree of multiplexing. This is due to the finite bandwidth of the emission spectrum of commonly used fluorophores, and the limited range of the visible spectrum. There is a need for higher multiplexing capabilities for droplet microfluidics systems. Therefore, Stanford inventors developed a novel multiplexing method that uses fluorescence and encoding of multiple samples by the spatial and temporal sequence of droplet formations and the subsequent spatial positioning of droplets in a constrained, poorly mixed output region. This new method can be applied in varying configurations, one of which is to use four different dyes in combination with spatial positioning to achieve 48-sample multiplexing. Applications: Multiplexed droplet-based assays in biomedical research, drug discovery and cancer screening. Advantages: Improved degree of multiplexing by one or two orders of magnitude relative to current techniques.

Coronary microvascular dysfunction is increasingly recognized in types of cardiovascular disease, underlining the need for more effective studies of cardiac pericytes under pathophysiological conditions.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a method to target and lower alpha-synuclein, a major protein constituent of Lewy bodies that accumulate in the brain in Parkinson's disease, using viral gene transfer of mutant Cas9 coupled with a small guide RNA targeting the promoter region of the alpha-synuclein gene. Parkinson's disease is a common cause of morbidity in the aging population. A key feature of Parkinson's disease is the accumulation of a protein called alpha-synuclein, which aggregates into Lewy bodies and results in neuronal death. Alpha-synuclein gene mutations result in early onset and progressive disease, and lowering alpha-synuclein levels alleviates disease. Parkinson's disease has no cure, and current treatments aim to manage symptoms. There is, therefore, a significant need to develop novel therapies for Parkinson's disease. Therefore, Stanford researchers devised a way to target alpha-synuclein and lower its levels in vivo using viral gene transfer of mutant Cas9 coupled with a small guide RNA targeting the promoter region of the alpha-synuclein gene. Viral gene transfer was achieved using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector carrying their specially designed guide RNA delivered intrathecally into the cisterna magna. With this approach, the researchers successfully downregulated alpha-synuclein in a humanized transgenic mouse model.",

    "ip_description": "Actigraphy, or the non-invasive study of human activity-rest cycles, is a field of study of growing importance as ambulatory and at-home monitoring of patients becomes more popular. It has the potential to revolutionize clinical trials, sleep studies, and even patient monitoring of recovery after injury or surgery. One of the most important applications of actigraphy is to understand natural sleep-wake patterns, especially since these are nearly impossible to truly replicate in a clinical or laboratory setting. With actigraphy, we can quantify the duration, timing, and quality of sleep experienced at home using automated algorithms. Actigraphy traditionally relies on data across multiple days or weeks to characterize routines and activity-rest cycles of a single person. While this may be possible for those who follow strict routines, reliance on longitudinal data collection to establish sleep patterns is not possible for those with erratic sleeping patterns or changing schedules, or in cases of shorter duration studies.\n\nThe Coleman Lab at Stanford has invented an algorithm capable of classifying sleep and wake states in a single day from triaxial accelerometer data. Traditional actigraphy relies on days to weeks' worth of activity data to characterize patterns of activity and rest within individuals, but reliance on longitudinal data is challenging for short studies and for individuals with irregular schedules. This novel, two-stage algorithm classifies sleep and wake states from a single day. The algorithm uses many features of triaxial accelerometer data to capture the signal variability, and a two-step process modeling reduces the noise from each single-stage classification alone. Additionally, existing algorithms classify sleep from proprietary actigraphy device outputs, but triaxial accelerometers are built into most smart devices and can be used by this algorithm, making tracking activity cycles more accessible. The invention is more accurate (97%) than the gold standard Cole-Kripke algorithm (60-70%) used in commercial clinical devices. This simple, automated algorithm capable of classifying sleep and wake robustly using triaxial accelerometer data on a single day basis would broaden the usability of actigraphy for clinical, research, and consumer device purposes.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   -Compatible with any wearable device that has triaxial accelerometer data capture, such as smartwatch devices from Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, and others.\n*   -Can be implemented in products to help determine sleep duration, timing, regularity, and quality for consumers who purchase these products.\n*   -Can be integrated into clinical grade wearable devices for assessing sleep, such as for at-home sleep studies or to track patients over time.\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   -Widely available measure, compared to existing methods such as the Cole-Kripke algorithm that is built for proprietary measures only\n*   -Compatible with all smart devices that have built-in triaxial accelerometers\n*   -More accurate (97%) than the gold standard Cole-Kripke algorithm (60-70%) used in commercial clinical devices",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have established a deep learning segmentation algorithm for non-contrast CT images to aid clinicians in decision making and improve the speed of symptom to treatment in acute ischemic stroke. Supervised deep learning models are powerful tools in clinical image segmentation. While these models have promise for application to stroke imaging, there are challenges in their use in non-contrast computed tomography (CT) images. Specifically, low signal to noise ratios in non-contrast CT images restrict the development of accurate reference annotations that are essential for the supervised deep learning model training. Further, the identification of acute ischemic stroke is highly time sensitive, with clinical outcomes highly correlating with the time from symptom onset to treatment. Thus, a simple model that can directly predict a probability heat map or a binary segmentation offers a fast route for clinicians to use the information contained within non-contrast CT images in clinical decision making. In this technology, a model trained on random expert sampling is established, harnessing interpretations from three expert neuroradiologists. The model can identify the location and volume of acutely ischemic brain tissue in non-contrast CT images and significantly correlates clinical outcomes. The model outperforms human expert performance, offering a faster route than current tools for clinicians to interpret non-contrast CT images for acute ischemic stroke. Applications: Automatic segmentation of acute ischemic stroke in non-contrast CT images for triaging patients for optimal treatment. Advantages: More reliable identification, quantification, and localization of acute ischemic stroke in non-contrast CT images; Shorter times from symptom onset to treatment, which is correlated to clinical outcome; Reduces the need for additional imaging procedures; Enables the use of widely available non-contrast CT for acute ischemic stroke instead of specialized imaging procedures the require particular expertise and have more limited availability.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford inventors have developed a method for manufacturing perovskite solar modules at lower cost and greater device stability by utilizing a novel transparent conducting oxide (TCO) lift-off scribing method. Hybrid organometallic lead-halide perovskite solar cells are an emerging thin film solar technology with the potential for lower cost production and increased performance relative to conventional silicon modules or currently available thin film technologies. However, the current methods for creating these next-generation solar modules consists of a complex multistep laser scribing process requiring multiple laser sources across multiple layers of the starting material. In this work, Stanford engineers describe a streamlined process for scribing perovskite solar cells using a TCO-based liftoff mechanism that relies solely on laser absorption in the front transparent electrode material, reducing thermal damage to the overlying layers and allowing for fast scribing speeds with low-cost ?s-pulse duration fiber laser systems. Demonstrating > 3 m/s processing speeds, TCO-based liftoff provides the highest throughput laser scribing method for thin-film photovoltaic devices produced on glass/TCO substrates, capable of processing large-area perovskite solar modules at a manufacturing scale. Applications: Manufacturing of perovskite solar panels. Advantages: 2.5x Faster - Indirect lift-off method enables microsecond-pulse laser scribing for high-throughput production (180 m/min scribe speeds), Scalable, Less residual thermal damage as a result of the scribing process, Tunable to a number of different substrate, transparent conducting oxide, and transport layer materials.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists developed a novel strategy that uses resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to determine whether a person will respond to treatment for depression. Major depressive disorder (MDD), a leading cause of disability worldwide, is likely a product of abnormal communication patterns within brain-wide networks. An inability to detect biomarkers of MDD in the human brain has slowed progress in MDD treatment. Mechanism-based MDD biomarkers have eluded us due to conceptual and experimental barriers. First, it is difficult to assign a causal relationship between biomarkers and MDD because causal tests are rarely performed on seemingly MDD-related differences identified in patients. Second, although MDD arises from aberrant communication in the brain, many neuroimaging studies evaluate either tonic activity levels in individual brain regions or functional connectivity between brain regions. The latter comes with a major caveat that signaling directionality is not assigned, with possibly significant physiological implications. Stanford researchers sought to address these problems by examining how directed communication patterns in the human brain relate to the neurobiology of MDD using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and rs-fMRI. They found that active rTMS modulates the directional flow of rs-fMRI activity between different brain regions and that variance in the temporal effect's magnitude corresponds to treatment efficacy. Additionally, they found that rTMS corrects a baseline aberrancy in neural flow patterns. They also showed that the baseline temporal structure of individual patients with MDD can predict treatment response. Hence, they developed a novel biomarker for depression treatment efficacy. Note: This docket is related to S22-390, which describes neuromodulation targeting based on lag-based resting state functional connectivity.",

    "ip_description": "Uveitis is an intraocular inflammation in the eye and represents a major cause of visual impairment and blindness worldwide. The current standard of care for non-infectious uveitis is corticosteroids, which has frequent side effects, including steroid-induced glaucoma or cataract. To address this unmet need for alternative immunosuppressive therapies in the eye, Stanford researchers have identified a novel peptide, SEMA7A using an aptamer-based proteomics assay. This peptide comprises a binding domain for binding to its receptor Plexin C1 (PLXNC1), which in turn has a broad immunosuppressive effect in vivo, reducing the number of infiltrating neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells in several compartments of the eye, and affecting a wide range of inflammatory signaling pathways.

    "ip_number": "S22-317",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a compact, scalable electronic readout that can multiplex 24 or more fast outputs of each 6x4 SiPM array to only 1 timing channel per detector layer unit. It can do this while maintaining ~100 ps CTR, which can potentially support the world's best CTR TOF-PET system. Current PET medical imaging systems use large numbers of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) to obtain high resolution results and a good time of flight (TOF) performance. This creates a need for effective and scalable multiplexing readout approaches to reduce the number of electronic channels. Most multiplexing methodologies degrade the fast-timing capabilities necessary for TOF-PET. This novel technology saves resources and reduces complexity without degrading the CTR performance. If successful, a TOF-PET system with 100 ps CTR enables substantial boost in reconstructed image signal-to-noise ratio compared to state-of-the-art TOF-PET systems. Applications include TOF-PET scanners, autonomous vehicles, object detection, active pedestrian safety, robot navigation, people counting, and other products that employ timing measurements using multiple sensors. Advantages include a higher multiplexing ratio than current best available systems, higher CTR than current best available systems, and over 40% signal-to-noise ratio improvement relative to Siemens Biograph Vision TOF-PET scanner.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a method called Identity Preserving Sample Multiplexing (IPSM) for the scaled up and rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects. At the beginning of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, reliably tracking SARS-CoV-2 among patients was a critical step in quarantining, triaging, and treating positive patients. However most hospitals were initially unable to process even 1000 tests per day due to the shortage of reagents and other resources, whereas an order of magnitude or more that number of clinical tests were needed to adequately meet patients' needs. In addition, due to the high positivity rate of tested populations, standard pooling assays (where groups of samples are co-purified and patients in positive groups are re-tested individually) were not appropriate as, by mid-March 2020, up to 25% of tests in highly populated regions such as New York were positive. Therefore, a multiplexed strategy was necessary to allow the scaling up of tests while robustly preserving patient identity. The inventors have designed an approach to non-enzymatically barcode patient samples in large collection volumes and then concentrate those samples within a pooled library. Each barcode consists of three high-melting temperature oligos that anneal at adjacent positions along the viral genome and thereby also provide a position barcode. After annealing barcoding oligos to the target viral RNA, each oligo is then ligated using an RNA-splinted ligation. The ligation product is then amplified and distributed into 2n wells and the abundance of each ligated barcode is then quantified by qPCR with patient-specific primers as a proxy for viral load. Each barcoded patient sample is also redundantly pooled in two non-overlapping patient cohorts along with positive and normalizing controls, providing replicate readouts for each patient's samples. Applications: A unified testing platform for clinical laboratories to dramatically scale up community surveillance and patient diagnostics. Identifying positive patient samples within a pooled population without the need to exhaustively reprocess all patients within positive cohorts. Advantages: The assay allows testing with a ligase rather than a reverse-transcriptase enzyme, providing an alternative way to create the template for the qPCR reaction. The assay provides quadruple redundancy to capture measurement noise for both sample barcoding and real-time qPCR. The core workflow with approximately 1000 samples can be completed in ~2.5 hours by a staff of 2-3 people, thereby the inventors' conservative estimate of throughput for this method is 10,000 samples per day for each available 384-well plate qPCR machine. All aspects of the IPSM technology can be implemented using standard equipment and commonly available molecular biology reagents.",
