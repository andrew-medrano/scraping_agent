    "ip_description": "Sensors using individual atomic defects in diamond have revolutionized local magnetic sensing. This technology is based on the insight that higher densities of defects can produce more sensitive detectors. However, at very high densities, interactions between defects complicate the detector operation. Specifically, when the spins in a quantum detector get too close, they typically hit an interaction-limited sensitivity threshold. This technology innovation considered the effect of a periodic external field that depends on the nature of the interactions. The discovery uses a periodic driving of the spin system to enable a sensor to surpass previous limits on using high densities of spins.\n\nThis fundamental innovation applies to spin ensembles in general. These are ubiquitous in solid matter, either due to spins of the atomic nuclei, or due to localized electron spins as in the case of nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond. In particular, the technique could be used to sense the magnetic field at the surface of a dense, 2D array of nitrogen-vacancy defects. Alternatively, Carbon-13 nuclei doped into graphene could also be driven into the collective states that form the basis of the sensing strategy.\n\nApplications of magnetic field sensing using nitrogen vacancy centers are broad, including quantum computing applications, molecular sensing for chemistry and pharmaceutical applications, cell biology, and more.",

    "ip_description": "In the field of diamond-defect-based quantum information processing, electron spins at defect sites sit within a diamond spin-vacuum and external interface is enabled via photon emission. In comparison to nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond, silicon-vacancy (SiV) defects possess superior coherence of emitted photons, but limited spin coherence. In this invention, the team identified and overcame this spin coherence limitation by cooling the SiV defect below the spin-orbit energy, thereby splitting responsibility for the poor spin coherence. Below this temperature threshold the spin qubit exhibits a superb spin coherence time of 13 ms, exceeding many competing technologies. As a result, the system embodies an important quantum building block, since it entangles a non-local photon with a localized, coherent electron spin. This achievement could form the basis for a quantum computing system longer term, but more near term could be applied to constructing a quantum network and in quantum security applications. By the time the spin in the cryostat decoheres, the photon can propagate down an optical fiber to a distance (~ 103 km) comparable to global distance scales.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers led by Johan Paulsson have engineered a high-throughput microfluidic device for multigenerational culturing, imaging, and tracking of single-cell lineages. The platform is highly customizable and is compatible with many cell types, ranging from bacteria to mammalian cells. Growing cells can be observed across complex and changing environmental conditions by virtually any type of microscopy, and any individual cell(s) of interest can be recovered for further downstream processing such as multi-omics or functional profiling. The team hopes to partner with an industry collaborator to demonstrate high-throughput phenotypic screening and subsequent isolation of select cells in a commercial context.\n\nThe device addresses shortcomings with current single-cell screening methods. Cytometry-based techniques often struggle to disentangle genetically heritable states from transient phenotypic variability since only single snapshots are considered, failing to capture dynamic processes. Screens that rely on microplates in turn suffer from limited throughput and require arrayed library formats. Pooled techniques that implicate genetic barcodes require upstream molecular cloning and severely limit the complexity and range of variants that can be characterized. The invention presented here resolves even slight phenotypic differences with quantitative multi-image classifications; operates at high-throughput due to scalable microfluidic designs that allow for parallelized screening; and accepts cellular populations of arbitrary diversities, including pooled genetic libraries and ecological samples, as variants are physically accommodated and collected.\n\nThe team believes that the detailed phenotyping and live-cell extraction features \u2013 coupled with high throughput and low cost of fabrication \u2013 give the technology significant potential to complement, and even supplant in many instances, conventional cytometry- and microplate-based screening tools. A supplementary capability for on-chip intracellular delivery, followed by immediate observation and sorting of top-performing clones, further broadens the scope of applications and may prove to be invaluable for the development of cell-based therapeutics.",

Combining methods from classical machine learning and quantum computing, the Demler lab has recently shown it is possible to achieve super-polynomial speedup in solving inference problems related to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR is one of the most powerful analytical techniques available to biology, however, it presents challenges in data interpretation. NMR spectra only directly observes the magnetic spectrum of a biological sample, whereas the ultimate goal is to identify and quantify chemical compounds. This is manageable for small molecules but becomes problematic when the complexity of the molecules increases, or when many spectra overlap. The resulting spectral profiling is often best done by a trained expert, which makes analysis slow and leads to inconsistent results, thus hindering clinical and industrial adoption of NMR. This work enables improved speed and consistency of NMR analysis for complex molecules, greatly enhancing the power of this analysis tool for the biopharma industry.",

When an operator needs protection from different hazard types, they are forced to wear multiple layers for protection. To overcome this limitation, researchers from Kit Parker\u2019s lab have created a multifunctional protective material to protect against thermal and ballistic hazards simultaneously. To achieve this multifunctionality, para-aramid nanofiber sheets were fabricated with empty space between the fibers. The fibers provide mechanical integrity against impact, while the voids create thermal insulation. This mechanically robust aerogel was demonstrated to have similar ballistic protection properties and 20x the insulation capability as compared to commercial para-aramid fibers.\n\nWith a unique combination of protective properties, this material has several potential applications within the personal protective, clothing, and structural material markets. For the personnel protective market, the material can improve the thermal resistance of body armor and cut-resistant gloves. Additionally, the fiber sheets may have added energy absorption properties relevant for ballistic protection and bike helmets. The nanofiber sheets could also be used as an insulating layer in a winter jacket to provide protection against fragmentation debris. For the structural material markets, it can serve as a liner for structures where extreme temperatures and flying debris are a threat, such as army tents or space stations.",

Currently, actuators based on dielectric elastomers cannot morph in shape. This technology enables morphing of an initially flat elastomer sheet into shapes of different curvatures.

In the face of a sweeping pandemic, assays should require no specialized equipment and should have rapid and easy-to-read visual results. Researchers in Constance Cepko\u2019s lab at Harvard Medical School have developed a novel assay that involves a fast and easy sample preparation protocol and yields results in under an hour with excellent sensitivity. The team hopes to collaborate with industrial partners to leverage both the sensitivity and ease of deployment of the technology to roll out the test in highly resource-constrained environments. The innovation is based on the reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) technique from New England Biolabs. The team has developed a robust RT-LAMP primer set that enables highly sensitive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome that induces a strong colorimetric reaction. Because of the strength of this color change, point-of-care LAMP-based diagnostics do not require specialized or expensive detection instruments. In addition to improvements on the assay, the team has also optimized sample preparation to further increase sensitivity from a media sample as small as 0.5mL. Sample preparation is performed in a single tube in a matter of minutes and requires only three buffers, an inexpensive pulse-spin mini-centrifuge, and a 65\u00b0C heat block, allowing for ease of application by medical personnel at point-of-care institutions.",

The device combines a quantum cascade laser with a traditional optically pumped far-infrared laser. By tuning the quantum cascade laser emission to the excitation frequencies of the molecular gas used in the device, a near limitless range of terahertz frequencies with powers in the range of 1mW can be accessed. This technology overcomes the shortcomings of traditional terahertz sources in that it is compact (about the size of a shoebox), has an impressive power and frequency range, and can operate at room temperature.\n\nThis novel device opens the terahertz range to applications in wireless communications, spectroscopy, and radar. The ability to adjust frequencies to avoid high atmospheric absorption offers promise for telescopes as well as free-space communication networks. In comparison with microwaves, the higher frequency and greater spatial resolution of terahertz radiation can afford future wireless communication systems with greater bandwidth and reduced power requirements.

The vector can express viral, bacterial, or cancer gene products and has been used to induce protective immunity in humanized mice against HIV and rhesus macaques against simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Further, the vector has a low toxicity profile and avoids concerns with unintended off-target reactions observed with traditional viral vectors as a result of its non-replicating behavior. Among the vectored antigens developed in the lab is the SARS virus spike protein. This vectored antigen serves as a proof of concept to integrate the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) spike protein antigen into the HSV-1 d106S vector platform, given the striking similarity between SARS and COVID-19. The team is seeking industrial collaboration with COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers to ensure robust and persistent immune responses. Developing the HSV-1 d106S vector with the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein antigen offers many advantages over existing vaccine vector technologies. First, although HSV-1 is a common infection, pre-existing HSV-1 immunity has little impact on the efficacy of the HSV-1 vaccine vectors in a mouse model. Second, the HSV replication-defective vectors induce a strong Th1 helper T cell response. As such, this vector induces a strong priming immune response. Finally, the d106S virus-based vectors express 10-fold higher levels of transgenes than adenovirus 5-based vectors, thereby enhancing the vaccine efficiency. From a production standpoint, the team has developed a complementing cell line that expresses Cas9 and a CRISPR guide RNA that eliminates parental virus, so recombinant viruses are almost pure in the initial progeny and can be constructed quickly. Collectively, the HSV-1 d106S vaccine vector platform could be used to rapidly make a COVID-19 vaccine to aid in the fight against this global pandemic.",

The team is hoping to collaborate with manufacturers of COVID-19 vaccines to further demonstrate enhanced immune responses to infectious disease antigens. Despite decades of adjuvant research, only four adjuvants have been approved in the seven major markets. Of these, only two (Alum and AS04) are licensed in the United States. Any additional adjuvants would need to meet stringent safety requirements imposed by the regulatory authorities. Although Alum is safe and efficacious, it has proven unsuccessful in several infectious disease applications. To address this unmet need, the lab of Dr. von Andrian began to explore alternatives to the traditional adjuvant modalities. The discovery was made when the team noticed an increase in findings relating clodronate liposomes to antiviral immune responses. When they investigated deeper, the team discovered that bisphosphonates alone lead to enhanced and accelerated humoral immune responses to a wide variety of antigens including viruses, proteins, haptens, and commercial vaccine formulations. The team also found that bisphosphonates directly target B cells, leading to increased antibody production.

The team is looking to further demonstrate enhanced immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines through industrial collaboration. The discovery was made to help overcome deficiencies with classical in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA. IVT-mRNA contain the code for protein production, and when delivered to target cells, are translated by cell machinery to produce antigen. The antigen, which could be cancer- or pathogen-specific, subsequently elicit an immune response from the host. While IVT-mRNA represents a novel vaccine class and provides advantages over traditional protein vaccines, such as ease of manufacture and favorable safety profile, one challenge is potentially insufficient immunity induced by IVT-mRNA alone. Through study of the mechanisms of mRNA translation and innate immunity, the Church lab found that a critical aspect of generating a strong immune response to the vaccine was to activate the RIG-I virus surveillance mechanism of the cell. To accomplish this, the team developed an IVT-mRNA vaccine platform that combines the antigen-coding sequence in addition to a RIG-I activating adjuvant sequence within a single mRNA transcript. This strategy is a departure from classic strategies which involve co-administration of adjuvant with the IVT-mRNA transcript and allows precise spatial control of antigen and adjuvant, as well as \u201ctunable\u201d immuno-stimulation. Results demonstrate that this highly versatile strategy generates robust immune responses compared to unmodified IVT-mRNA for infectious disease and neo-antigen oncology vaccines.",

To overcome these issues, the lab sought to stabilize and fix the orientation of these protein-liposome assemblies by anchoring them to nanoparticles. The team accomplishes this by generating bicelles that contain a membrane protein functionalized with an affinity tag. This affinity tag then binds to its specific binding receptor located on the surface of the nanoparticle.

These systems employ point defects in crystal lattices, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds, as quantum sensors. In typical use, an optical source is used to excite an array of sensors, and the value of the physical quantity is inferred from the measured amplitude modulation. However, the excitation can deposit heat into the system, which can contribute false signals. Excess heat may also prevent use of the system with temperature-sensitive samples, such as biological samples. Additionally, vibrational displacement of the sensors relative to the optical excitation source can affect measurement sensitivity. Thus, a stable mounting platform that can remove heat from the system is desirable to enable solid state spin sensors to operate at their full potential. Metals such as copper and aluminum are widely used as heatsinks due to their high thermal conductivity, however, the use of such materials for mounting solid state spin sensors can be problematic since electrically conductive materials can interfere with delivery of microwave radiation. This invention describes an integrated solution for mounting a solid state spin sensor using semi-insulating silicon carbide, metalized layers for applying microwave radiation, and light couplers to efficiently deliver optical excitation. In addition to directing heat flow out of the system, the mounting structure facilitates delivery of optical excitation, does not interfere with microwave radiation, and provides a stable base to limit vibrations.

    "ip_description": "Nitrogen vacancy (NV) diamond solid-state spin systems are highly useful for quantum sensing, however, improving the sensitivity is essential to realizing their potential applications. DC magnetic field sensitivity is typically limited by dephasing of the NV spin state, where the dephasing time (T2*) limits the experimental sensing time. This invention details a method to improve the sensitivity of NV magnetometers by extending T2*, resulting in up to 10x improvement in sensitivity and up to 100x decrease in the sensing time required to attain a given measurement. This is achieved by (1) applying RF control of the spin bath surrounding the NV sensor spins, and/or (2) working with differential double quantum (DQ) spin transition, which both rejects common-mode noise sources and enhances sensitivity to magnetic fields. In addition to substantially improving NV magnetometer sensitivity, this method also suppresses sensitivity to non-magnetic signals such as temperature and electric field fluctuations.\n\nNV magnetometers are expected to replace fluxgate magnetometers for field sensing in military, industrial, and commercial applications. Examples include: detection of magnetic anomalies in combat and security environments, magnetic communication for defense and industrial purposes (submarines, mines), orientation and sensing for drilling and mining machines, and magnetic imaging of structures on the sub-micron scale (bio-magnetism and paleomagnetism). Additionally, the invention is expected to be applicable to improving the sensitivity of other solid state spin-based sensors.",

    "ip_description": "A startup emerging from Jennifer Lewis' lab intends to commercialize a technology platform that can produce microdroplets of highly viscous fluids, with applications in drug formulation and delivery. Droplet-based printing of soft materials has exciting applications in biotech, electronics, and beyond. Researchers in Jennifer Lewis\u2019 lab, with support from the Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator, have developed a novel microparticle production technology that harnesses an acoustophoretic field to precisely dispense microdroplets from highly viscous fluids with droplet volumes ranging from sub-nL to uL. Importantly, this process doesn\u2019t require high temperatures or shear stress, enabling the encapsulation and protection of cargo such as therapeutic molecules and stem cells. Acoustica Bio, a startup emerging from the Lewis Lab, intends to commercialize this technology by partnering with pharma companies to reformulate intravenous (IV) therapies into subcutaneous therapies (SC). The reformulation of dilute IV drug solutions into concentrated solutions suitable for SC injection is typically hampered by high viscosity, low solubility, aggregation, and poor stability. Using acoustophoretic printing, the company aims to encapsulate high molecular weight therapeutic molecules or biologics at high concentrations within hydrogel microparticles. Concentrated microparticle solutions can be formulated for subcutaneous drug delivery to improve patient care.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Introducing functionality into unactivated C-H bonds, a ubiquitous group in organic molecules, remains a significant challenge due to the inertness of the substrate. Traditional synthesis strategies involve functional group exchange, an inefficient process that generates significant waste and often requires strong chemical oxidants. This invention describes two novel iron-based catalysts used for direct functionalization of a broad range of C-H bonds. The method described in US Pat. No. 9487472 uses an iron-based catalyst to synthesize acyclic and cyclic amines of various chain lengths, ring sizes, and architectures on C-H bonds. A related method (patent pending) uses another novel iron-based catalyst to aminate C-H bonds without activating or protecting groups to produce substituted bicyclic, spiro, and fused heterocycles. Additionally, with this method the catalyst can be easily separated from the product and recycled to improve overall performance. This invention significantly improves a synthesis process that has historically been fraught with multiple steps, reagents, and waste generation, facilitating facile synthesis of acyclic and cyclic amines. These compounds are common in commodity chemicals as well as bioactive (e.g. nucleobases, B vitamins) and pharmaceutical (e.g. antibiotics, anti-histamines, anti-diabetics, NSAIDs, chemotherapies) molecules. This offers the potential to synthesize a broader library of active compounds for drug development and drug screening, or to improve synthesis processes for existing active compounds.",

    "ip_description": "A gene therapy startup emerging from the lab of George Church intends to deploy adeno-associated viruses (AAV) for gene transfer in the skin. The nascent company, called MARBLE, aims to target genetic diseases of the skin as well as age-related declines in skin function and appearance, combining classic monogenic disease targets alongside novel aging driver genes. While AAV has the best safety profile and history of clinical efficacy of any gene therapy vector, it has not previously been applied to skin indications due to a number of technical limits. Transduction of cells in situ within the skin is inefficient, and diffusion within the skin limited. The small packaging capacity of AAV constrains the use of large transgenes, such as structural proteins essential for treating diseases of the skin. More fundamentally, delivery across the outer barrier of the skin is difficult, with established methods being highly variable and mechanically traumatic, resulting in an immune response which complicates future applications using the same AAV system. A technology platform developed in the Church Lab addresses these issues through a combination of molecular and materials innovations. Researchers have identified multiple AAV serotypes with strong ability to infect skin cells, enabling gene transfer and avoidance of preexisting immunity. The technology enables delivery of long genes via reduction of gene regulatory elements and an RNA splicing and DNA recombination-enabled multi-vector system. The novel technology platform aims to solve transdermal delivery through formulation of AAV vectors into polymer devices. Gene therapy agents and pharmacological molecules are delivered directly into skin tissues via transient tissue microchannels, enabling rapid micro-scale mass transport that results in high local concentrations. Unlike conventional injections, this polymeric delivery system is minimally invasive due to the superficial administration, which reduces pain and host immune response, a critical advantage for enabling re-dosing. Taken together, the safety and efficacy of the platform further enable development of age-related aesthetic and quality-of-life treatments, targeting novel skin aging genes identified through a uniquely powerful data analytics approach.",

Off-target drug toxicity is a significant concern for drug developers, as it can lead to side effects and other adverse events. Currently, small molecules targeting enzymatic activity are focused on evolutionarily conserved catalytic sites, often yielding ligands with relatively low specificity. To address this lack of specificity, David Liu's laboratory has developed a small-molecule enzyme inhibitor discovery platform that targets distal binding pockets of enzymes (exo-sites) that are not evolutionarily conserved. Combining this approach with DNA-encoded libraries, Exo Therapeutics, a startup emerging from the Liu Lab, intends to commercialize the platform, generating more potent drugs with higher specificity to the targeted substrate. The team has already identified a series of high-value target opportunities within oncology and is focusing its efforts on validation of reprogramming enzymes using exo-site function-selective inhibitors.",

A recent study from Germany surveyed 63 sites over 27 years and found an average 76% decline in airborne insect biomass, and just within the US there has been a 59% loss of domestic honeybee colonies between 1947-2005. This technology emerging from the lab of Robert Brucker at Harvard has the application of bacterial probiotic as a detoxicant to chemical xenobiotic exposure for honeybees, livestock, humans and drinking water. Naturally occurring bacteria that are able to metabolize compounds into less harmful compounds can derisk the largescale use of many agrochemicals including several herbacides. For farmers, doctors, and land management who are looking for ways to keep standard pest management practices in farming while reducing the risk of the associated agrochemicals, the use of microbial therapeutics can enable detoxification of agrochemicals through naturally occurring metabolism of bacteria.

    "ip_description": "Skeletal muscle and satellite cells are sensitive to biophysical and microenvironmental cues, and there is evidence that physical manipulation of damaged muscle may promote recovery. David Mooney\u2019s lab has used biphasic ferrogel scaffolds to create a system capable of massage-like compressions to promote muscle regeneration after severe injury. These scaffolds are implanted at the site of muscle injury, and an exterior magnetic field stimulates uniform cyclic compressions. Use of this system in a mouse model of severe muscle damage led to reduced fibrous capsule formation around the implants when compared to no treatment, as well as when compared to a similar compression treatment applied with an external pressure cuff. It also led to reduced fibrosis and inflammation in the injured muscle, enhanced muscle regeneration, and increase in mean muscle fiber size. Functionally, mice treated with cyclic mechanical compressions exhibited an increase in maximum contractile force of the injured muscle after two weeks. The ferrogels also exhibited an immunomodulatory role when stimulated, showing reduced levels of muscle-infiltrating inflammatory cells and macrophages.\n\n**Applications**\n\nBiphasic ferrogel scaffolds showed utility in a mouse model severe skeletal muscle injuries, which can lead to fibrosis, scarring, and loss of function. Currently, there is no therapeutic intervention that allows for a full functional restoration of severely injured muscle tissue. The improvement in muscle fiber size using this method, however, was of the same order of magnitude as cell and drug delivery approaches, and the functional gain was comparable to that of growth factor therapies. These biologic-based therapies, however, are limited by loss of local concentration, growth factor bioactivity, and regenerative potential associated. This provides a biologic-free system for a simple but effective alternative to cell-based therapies. Incorporation of cyclic mechanical compressions into existing drug and cell delivery systems could also potentially lead to new and better combination therapies. It could be used in other tissues and diseases for mechanically driven regeneration, and find a more broad utility in the field of regenerative medicine.",
