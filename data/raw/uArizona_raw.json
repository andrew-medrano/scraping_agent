    "ip_description": "This is an innovative spreadsheet-based method designed to improve the efficiency of training and evaluation for cultured cell lifting and cryopreservation procedures. It is part of a comprehensive training program aimed at streamlining skill acquisition in cell culture labs. Unlike traditional methods, where training outcomes are evaluated broadly based on overall experimental results, this system introduces stepwise, quantifiable criteria that pinpoint specific skill areas for improvement. The spreadsheet automatically calculates and evaluates key performance metrics, eliminating the need for highly skilled personnel to manually assess training progress. This not only shortens the training period but also enhances troubleshooting capabilities, making it easier to identify and address specific challenges in the process. This method has been successfully implemented in training programs, yielding significant improvements in student performance. By breaking down complex cell culture procedures into manageable components with measurable outcomes, it empowers trainees with a clear understanding of their progress and areas for improvement. Undergraduate students trained using this system have achieved notable successes, including generating high-quality research data, co-authoring peer-reviewed publications, and presenting at international scientific conferences. Additionally, the system reduces stress and frustration for trainees by providing a structured framework for identifying and addressing experimental challenges, fostering motivation and confidence in the lab environment. This method addresses the inefficiency and inconsistency in training and evaluating skills in cell culture laboratories, particularly for procedures like cell lifting and cryopreservation. In traditional training methods, the outcomes are typically assessed based on the overall success of an experiment, which makes troubleshooting difficult and time-consuming. These methods often require a higher baseline skill level from trainees and significant oversight from skilled personnel, leading to prolonged training periods and increased resource demand. Unlike existing methods, this system breaks down the training process into clearly defined key skills, each with quantifiable outcomes that are automatically evaluated, allowing trainees to receive precise feedback without the constant need for expert supervision. It also fosters a less stressful and more motivating training environment, making it particularly beneficial for individuals with lower initial knowledge or experience levels.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a specialized incubator rack system designed to optimize cell culture in microplates by providing uniform growth conditions (equal airflow, humidity, and thermal conditions) for all plates regardless of their position in the stack. This rack ensures consistent growth conditions for cells compared to traditional incubator practices where plates are often directly stacked, potentially affecting the growth consistency of cultured cells. In laboratory settings, cell cultures are commonly grown in microplates that are placed directly in incubators. Reducing plate-to-plate variation when performing cell culture in microplates is an essential goal in cell-based research. Existing incubator racks have solid (often thermally conductive metal) shelves and walls. This limits air flow around the microplates (causing differences in CO2/O2 exposure and evaporation among plates in the stack), as well as increases thermal conductivity often causing the plates closer to the bottom stack to change temperature faster, which can lead to inconsistent growth that can affect experimental outcomes. Hence, there is a need for incubator racks that can better support consistent growth of cell cultures across multiple microplates. Applications include cell culture, laboratory research, biotechnology, pharmaceutical industries, educational institutions, and clinical research. Advantages include improved consistency in cell growth, enhanced airflow, low thermal conductivity, increased lab efficiency, and broad compatibility.",

It blocks infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation to improve energy efficiency, reduce heat gain, and protect interiors from UV damage, while integrating a UV-reflective pattern to enhance window visibility for birds. The coating combines both energy-efficient solar control and bird safety into a single, integrated solution, offering a dual-purpose window coating. A low-emissivity infrared-reflective layer helps maintain a cooler interior environment, improving energy efficiency by reducing the need for air conditioning. The reflective pattern enhances contrast at UV wavelengths, aiding in bird detection of the window surface without disrupting human aesthetics.\n\nWindows and glass facades are a significant cause of bird collisions, leading to millions of bird deaths annually. At the same time, solar control window coatings are widely used for energy efficiency, blocking UV and IR radiation to reduce heat gain and energy consumption. Conventional solutions for energy-efficient windows often use coatings that block IR and UV light to reduce heat gain and protect interior spaces from UV damage. Separately, coatings have been developed to improve window visibility for birds by reflecting UV light, as birds can see in the UV spectrum. These two functions\u2014solar control and bird collision prevention\u2014have been addressed independently in prior technologies, but there is a need for a single solution that combines both capabilities effectively without compromising either functionality.

This architecture\u2019s emphases on maintainability and reliability make it an essential tool for modern cloud-based and distributed software systems. This technology addresses the challenge of managing changes in decentralized, microservice-based software systems. Microservice architectures have become vital to modern cloud-native systems because of their scalability and modularity. In such systems, updates to one microservice can create unintended ripple effects across the architecture, leading to conflicts, system degradation, or failures. Existing solutions often rely on static analysis or manual review processes, which are time-consuming, prone to errors, and lack the ability to provide a holistic view of how changes propagate across a complex, interconnected system. Tools like SonarCloud or similar static code analysis platforms only focus on individual code repositories and cannot account for system-wide dependencies or interactions.

    "ip_description": "This invention addresses a growing need for alpha-gal-free milk, designed to aid individuals with Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS). AGS is triggered by the ingestion of alpha-galactose (aGal), a carbohydrate found in red meat and, in some cases, dairy products. While not all AGS patients react to dairy, avoiding its consumption completely is often recommended to prevent symptom progression. This method preprocesses milk using an enzyme to remove aGal effectively, resulting in a product suitable for AGS patients without sacrificing the nutritional benefits of milk. This innovative approach not only reduces the immunoreactivity of aGal in milk but also ensures the process is cost-effective, leveraging an enzyme already available as a supplement. This method provides a potential breakthrough for AGS patients, expanding safe dietary options and contributing to improved quality of life. This technology addresses the challenge faced by individuals with Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS), a condition triggered by consuming alpha-galactose (aGal) which is found in red meat and dairy products. AGS can cause severe allergic reactions, leading to recommendations that all AGS patients avoid dairy, despite only 10-20% being affected by it. Currently, the only effective strategy for these individuals is complete dietary avoidance of foods containing aGal, limiting their access to essential nutrients found in dairy products. This restriction impacts quality of life and nutritional intake, as there are no widely available dairy alternatives that ensure alpha-gal is eliminated. Unlike general lactose-free or dairy-free products, this innovation offers a solution by enzymatically processing milk to remove aGal, allowing AGS patients to safely consume dairy without the risk of triggering allergic reactions. This innovative approach offers a new dietary option, bridging a critical gap in AGS dietary management.",

The design features a lightweight, inflatable structure that employs a dual airtight zipper door enclosure to maintain a pressure-safe atmosphere for astronauts. This zipper mechanism, inspired by spacesuit designs, allows astronauts to seal and access the habitat from either inside or outside, addressing a critical gap in current emergency habitat technology. This allows for operation from both sides and includes a locking mechanism to prevent accidental depressurization. The shelter is compact enough to be carried on a rover or by hand and can be rapidly deployed to create a pressure-safe atmosphere for one to two astronauts. This streamlined and lightweight approach makes it ideal for short-term emergency use without requiring the bulky infrastructure of traditional, hard-shell habitats. With upcoming lunar and Martian exploration, developing effective shelters is crucial for astronaut safety. Situations like rover malfunctions, suit failures, exhaustion, or injuries require quick access to protective habitats. Traditional metal-enclosed shelters are strong but heavy, making them harder to move and set up.

    "ip_description": "This is an ultrathin Faraday isolator that combines polarization-sensitive metasurfaces with a few-micron-thick magneto-optical (MO) material to achieve efficient and compact optical isolation. By using metasurfaces, it minimizes the traditional size and material constraints of Faraday isolators. The metasurfaces diffract light at different angles based on its polarization state, enabling the isolator to direct light unidirectionally while requiring only minimal polarization rotation. Unlike conventional Faraday isolators that require substantial magnetic fields and thick materials to rotate the polarization of light, this ultrathin isolator achieves the same polarization rotation with a significantly reduced MO layer. It operates effectively with weak magnetic fields, broadening the range of practical applications. This novel approach enables a compact, efficient, and scalable solution for various optical and microwave circuits. Faraday isolators are essential in optical systems that require unidirectional light propagation to prevent feedback that can damage sensitive components. Traditional Faraday isolators rely on the Faraday effect, where a magnetic field induces rotation in the polarization of light passing through a magneto-optical material. However, these conventional designs are often bulky due to the thick materials and strong magnetic fields needed to achieve effective isolation. Existing enhancements, such as plasmonic field amplifications or magnetic Weyl semimetals, are impractical due to exotic material constraints or insufficient performance. Other magnetic-free approaches require dynamic refractive index modulation or intense electromagnetic fields, limiting their usability. Recent advancements in metasurfaces, which are engineered surfaces capable of manipulating electromagnetic waves, present an opportunity to reimagine Faraday isolators. This innovation significantly reduces device thickness, enhances performance, and expands the range of applications in classical and quantum electromagnetic technologies.",

Traditional colored surfaces tend to absorb specific wavelengths of light, which increases surface temperatures and diminishes cooling capabilities. In contrast, this invention employs advanced metasurface-based beam deflectors to produce coloration through light scattering, rather than absorption. This approach enables these surfaces to deflect unwanted wavelengths while maintaining efficient cooling properties, making them ideal for applications requiring thermal management in combination with aesthetic customization. The key challenge addressed by this invention is the inefficiency of conventional colored surfaces in cooling applications. Typically, such surfaces absorb light to achieve coloration, which results in increased heat accumulation and poor cooling performance. Current solutions struggle to balance aesthetic requirements with thermal management, especially in outdoor or heat-sensitive environments. The technology overcomes this by leveraging metasurface-based beam deflection or scattering, offering an efficient cooling solution without compromising color quality. Unlike traditional methods, this innovation avoids unnecessary absorption of light and instead reflects specific wavelengths for enhanced thermal regulation. Applications include building materials (heat reflective, colored exterior coatings), heat exchangers for industrial cooling systems, solar panels with integrated color customization, and outdoor furniture, roofing, or automotive surfaces.

This design makes it possible to create LP-QLDPC codes that ensure a minimum distance strictly greater than that of the lowest-weight stabilizer generators, which achieves superior error correction. By focusing on quasi-cyclic base codes, specifically type-I protographs, the method establishes necessary conditions for code construction based on row and column indices of the base code. This method results in QLDPC codes with certain minimum distance guarantees and degeneracy. Quantum computing is a rapidly growing field that can be used for more applications than classical computers, but it is prone to errors due to quantum decoherence and other noise sources. Error correction is crucial for the development of practical quantum computers. Error correction codes in quantum systems can be thought of as \u201csafety nets\u201d that catch and correct errors, allowing quantum systems to work accurately even in noisy environments where mistakes can easily happen. QLDPC codes are a leading candidate for error correction because of their efficiency and scalability.

TR is a phenomenon that occurs when the temperature in a LIB causes reactions to occur which produce more heat, which causes more reactions and is one of the leading causes of LIB fires. This technology uses an array of thermal sensors placed throughout a LIB module to collect real-time data. Then, a convolutional neural network-based machine learning model is used to compare the data to electrochemical models and predict whether TR will occur. By enabling the early detection of potential TR events, this technology identifies heat source locations and triggers real-time alerts, enhancing battery safety and thermal management. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) power a wide range of technologies including electric vehicles, phones, laptops, and wearable electronics. They are widely used because of their efficiency, high energy density, long lifespan, and fast charging, among other factors. However, they carry the risk of thermal runaway (TR), a chain reaction that can cause overheating and battery fires. Managing TR risk is crucial in the safe development of environmentally friendly technologies. Existing methods focus on passive safety mechanisms or post-event mitigation, which do not always prevent catastrophic failures.

This index used in combination with parental history of asthma might provide a set of useful tools to predict which infants are at the highest risk for developing asthma by the time they are school age.\n\nThere is new research that traces the origins of asthma to prenatal and early life exposures. This research suggests that most cases of asthma have their start in exposures occurring in pregnancy and early life.

These modified cells are then used in macro or microencapsulation devices, which provide a controlled environment for the cells, allowing for sustained and regulated insulin release. Additionally, the encapsulation devices protect the cells from the body\u2019s immune response while allowing them to function effectively. This solution not only offers a promising alternative for human diabetes treatment but also extends to veterinary applications, providing a scalable and reliable option for managing diabetes in companion animals. The approach has the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce reliance on daily insulin injections, and enhance the quality of life for individuals and their pets living with diabetes. Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition where the body either cannot produce sufficient insulin or cannot use it effectively, leading to high blood sugar levels. This imbalance can cause severe complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, nerve issues, and vision loss. Current treatments rely heavily on external insulin administration through injections or insulin pumps, but these methods require frequent monitoring, do not replicate the body\u2019s natural insulin response, and can be burdensome for patients. Advanced therapies like continuous glucose monitoring systems and insulin pumps have improved management, but they are not curative and may lead to challenges such as device failure or skin irritation. Current cell-based approaches, such as using primary \u03b2-cells or insulin producing stem cell technologies, often struggle with issues like cell durability, delivery, and immune rejection. This innovation addresses these limitations by developing surrogate \u03b2-cells that naturally produce and release insulin in response to blood glucose levels, similar to healthy pancreatic cells. This reduces the need for lifelong immune suppression and enhances cell survival, offering a more reliable, scalable, and patient-friendly solution.",

By comparing gene expressions from colorectal cancer cells under two different types of mechanical conditioning, this system identifies specific gene signatures that correlate with an increased risk of metastasis and lower survival rates. The gene score can be used to help determine whether patients with colorectal cancer should undergo additional preventative therapies to reduce the risk of metastasis. Additionally, the system involves in vitro analysis of colorectal cancer cells to develop a new gene score, called the MeCo-CRC score. This score is calculated by comparing the expression levels of genes associated with tissue stiffness, offering a novel approach to characterizing colorectal cancer and providing valuable insights into potential treatment outcomes. This technology addresses the challenge of accurately predicting the risk of metastasis in colorectal cancer patients and determining the efficacy of antifibrotic treatments. Current solutions often rely on traditional biomarkers or clinical staging, which may not fully capture the complexity of tumor behavior or effectively predict treatment outcomes. As a result, patients may not receive personalized treatment plans that could prevent the progression of their disease. This gene score system is different from existing technologies because it uses mechanical conditioning of cancer cells to identify gene signatures that correlate with metastasis risk and survival rates. By providing a more precise, biologically informed method for evaluating the likelihood of metastasis, this technology offers a way to better tailor treatments to individual patients.

The individual wears a safety harness and navigates a homelike environment that contains various obstacles simulating slips, trips, and stumbles. This controlled environment provides a safe and realistic setting for practicing balance recovery and fall prevention. The goal is to enhance an individual's ability to resist falls, potentially reducing fall incidents by 70% for up to two years. Falls are a major health concern, with healthcare costs related to fall injuries surpassing those of cancer treatments. Falls, especially among older adults, are a significant public health issue, often leading to severe injuries, loss of independence, and increased healthcare costs. Current solutions to address fall risk primarily involve physical therapy, balance training, and environmental modifications, but these approaches can be limited in effectiveness and accessibility. Many individuals who are at higher risk of falling do not receive enough real-world exposure to situations where they might trip, slip, or stumble, which are the leading causes of falls. Unlike existing methods that rely on static exercises, this approach simulates real-life hazards in a safe space, allowing individuals to practice fall recovery in a way that mimics everyday activities. The added realism and active engagement in this training is designed to better prepare users to avoid falls, making it a more effective and preventative solution compared to traditional therapies.

The technology employs an MR-based electrophysiological model to simulate and analyze potential lead placements. This allows healthcare providers to plan treatments with greater precision, reducing the need for trial-and-error adjustments during procedures. The algorithm has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of SCS therapy, offering a more personalized and efficient solution for patients managing chronic pain. Chronic pain affects millions of individuals worldwide, often requiring advanced treatments like spinal cord stimulation (SCS).

These maneuvers can be integrated into existing UAV autopilot systems to achieve more optimal flight paths and increase the range and endurance achievable by UAVs. Existing UAV flight path planning methods center on thermal soaring techniques. However, this method has limitations, especially in energy-deprived environments.

This approach is cost-effective and scalable, compatible with existing fabrication techniques, and can be applied to a wide range of fields including biomedical imaging, optical communications, and remote sensing. A key feature of this technology is its ability to exploit chromatic aberration to focus specific wavelengths of light onto a detector, while blocking others, effectively turning it into a spectral filter. This allows a single optical element to serve multiple functions, such as focusing light and filtering colors, making it ideal for applications like hyperspectral imaging. The invention\u2019s design is adaptable to the constraints of semiconductor foundry rules, ensuring it can be easily integrated into large-scale production processes.

The manifold integrates pressure relief mechanisms before and after a ball valve, ensuring that hazardous energy from pneumatic, hydraulic, or water-powered tools is safely controlled. The isolation of energy ensures that tools and supply lines are not over-pressurized when operating or during an ascent from depth. This system enhances diver safety by enabling in-water control of hazardous energy and rapid intervention during emergencies or tool maintenance. Underwater powered tools are critical for a range of tasks, from construction to salvage operations. However, these tools pose significant risks, including uncontrollable activation due to trigger failure or over-pressurization.

The system leverages the light field synthesizer to convert a single probe pulse into a train of temporally separated pulses, each with a distinct wavelength range. These pulses interact with a sample at different time delays, capturing multiple snapshots of the event's progression in a single measurement with high precision. These time delays can be adjusted by the user to optimally capture different types of events. This imaging technique makes it possible to take many shots of a sequence of events with only one measurement. This makes it ideal for the study of fast, non-repetitive phenomena in fields like material science, biophotonics, and chemical reactions. Traditional pump-probe imaging techniques often require a sequence of events to be repeated multiple times. Images of different stages of the sequence are captured on each repeat to eventually build up a detailed series of images that can be used to analyze the sequence of events. However, many phenomena are non-repetitive, with only one opportunity to capture their temporal evolutions, where these methods fall short. For these phenomena, standard pump-probe imaging methods that rely on many repetitions of an event are ineffective. The technology to be licensed overcomes this limitation by capturing many images with a single, high-speed measurement, resulting in a set of detailed images with high temporal resolution with no need for the studied phenomenon to be repeated.

By considering a subset of sensors and calculating a geometric phase change index (GPC-I) along various paths, the invention achieves more precise defect localization. This method is ideal for detecting defects in structures made of heterogeneous mixtures of materials which are difficult to monitor using standard techniques due to complicated scattering effects around the boundaries between materials. This method has been demonstrated to localize randomly placed structural defects with more accuracy, stability, clarity, and sensitivity than velocity difference or amplitude ratio methods. Heterogeneous boundaries in plate structures cause complicated reflection, refraction, and scattering patterns, making it harder to localize structural defects using standard metrics like velocity difference and amplitude ratio.

The modulation rate can be tuned for different purposes, as both the pulse repetition rates and interpulse delay times are adjustable. This modulation creates an environment in which entangled proton pairs can be generated via the dynamic Casimir effect. Furthermore, the high temporal resolution and high repetition rate of this laser pulse method allows it to be applied to a broad range of time-varying photonic applications. Developing time-varying photonics at optical wavelengths is a significant research challenge. To achieve time-varying photonics in the visible range, modulation of the optical properties of a material must be achieved at extremely high frequencies. For these reasons, the dynamic Casimir effect has never been observed at optical wavelengths. This invention bridges these gaps by leveraging high repetition rate laser pulses, offering a practical method to modulate optical properties at these frequencies. It takes advantage of the dynamic Casimir effect and serves as a source for entangled proton pairs and as a stepping stone for future advancement in the time varying photonics field. It paves the way for advanced applications in both quantum and time-varying photonic systems, providing a foundation for future innovations in optical technology.",

It uses stratospheric balloons to test hypersonic vehicles. This technique allows the vehicles to achieve hypersonic speeds through a combination of free fall and acceleration via rocket boosters after the drop. This stratospheric balloon drop concept can achieve the high subsonic or supersonic test conditions of interest to missions through the use of an innovative two-stage flight system. The test capsule is heavily instrumented such that the entire time history of the vehicle state is measured and recorded. Hypersonic vehicles are planes, missiles, and spacecraft that travel at a velocity greater than Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. These vehicles can provide high-speed travel on Earth and in space and are a major topic of research and innovation in the aerospace field. The dynamics of blunt-body vehicles in the supersonic and transonic regimes of atmospheric entry often play a dominant role in the design of atmospheric entry missions. Traditional methods of hypersonic flight testing, such as wind tunnels and ground-based test facilities, face limitations in replicating realistic flight conditions due to the challenges of simulating high-speed, high-altitude environments. Existing ground-based testing facilities also incur high costs and logistical complexities. Computational methods for predicting dynamic stability are improving in capability, but have yet to be adopted by missions, partially due to the sparse and non-flight-like nature of the experimental data that is currently used for validation.

Unlike traditional methods that use a beamsplitter or dichroic mirror to combine the modalities, this approach places the imaging components side by side, reducing size while maintaining functionality. By carefully cutting away a small portion of the high-resolution system, space is created for the widefield imaging system without significantly impacting light efficiency. This design offers a streamlined solution for clinical imaging applications where space is limited, making it easier to gather comprehensive information about tissue conditions. The system is designed to balance high precision and wide coverage, making it an effective tool for medical diagnostics and other clinical applications.

Radiative cooling describes the passive cooling effect caused by emission of thermal radiation from an object. Water naturally experiences significant radiative cooling, but the cooling efficiency from bodies of water is often limited by their humid environments. This conic shield counteracts this problem via a mirror that directs infrared radiation away from the water while simultaneously reflecting it back into the atmosphere, using angular selectivity to restrict thermal emission to angles near the zenith to enhance radiative cooling efficiency. This also improves the cooling efficiency of bodies of water while reducing their evaporation. On a large scale, implemented on thousands of reservoirs, this technology has the potential to help offset global warming, and make a major impact on global water management. Current strategies to tackle climate change center around reducing carbon emissions or recapturing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. However, a less-explored avenue to combat global warming is through engineering our planet to enhance its radiative cooling. This technology explores that potential, enhancing the radiative cooling of freshwater bodies to partially offset the effects of global warming. Furthermore, it has the added benefit of reducing evaporation from water sources, helping to reduce issues of water scarcity.",

Using a brush biopsy technique to collect cells from all layers of the cervix using a specialized brush, the specimen is spread on a slide and imaged using deep ultraviolet (dUVM) technology. This image is then analyzed for the presence of cervical cancer. By cutting out the need for complex sample transportation and laboratory processing, this method streamlines the entire screening process, allowing patients to receive accurate test results within 10 minutes, instead of waiting days. This technique covers a larger area of the cervix compared to other methods and provides results that are comparable to a more invasive punch biopsy. The brush biopsy method is also less invasive and less painful than punch biopsy methods and causes less bleeding, making it a more patient-friendly option for cervical cancer diagnosis. This technology aims to address the limitations of current cervical cancer screening methods, which typically involve staining specimens and sending them to a lab for analysis. This process can be time-consuming, expensive, and logistically challenging, often leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Current solutions, such as the traditional Pap smear, require laboratory staining and microscopic examination, which can take several days to yield results. These delays can be particularly problematic in low-resource settings, where access to timely diagnostics is critical. The brush biopsy method is a significant improvement over existing methods because it provides rapid and accurate results, saving time and money while also improving access to timely diagnostics, especially in underserved areas.

Traditional methods of assessing and treating pain rely heavily on subjective measures, which can lack accuracy and sensitivity. As a result, there is a growing need for objective tools to assess chronic pain and improve treatment outcomes. EEG (electroencephalography) has emerged as a promising option, offering a noninvasive, portable way to measure brain activity and capture real time changes related to pain perception. EEG's high temporal resolution allows for tracking rapid changes in brain processes, making it an ideal tool for studying pain modulation in clinical and research settings. The goal of this innovation is to use EEG data, which captures real time brain activity, and machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict which patients are most likely to respond to spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy, a common treatment for chronic pain. By identifying key EEG features linked to pain response, the system aims to provide a more reliable and objective way of predicting treatment success. While this innovation is still in development, it holds the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes by helping doctors tailor treatments based on individual neural profiles, reducing the risk of unsuccessful surgeries and improving cost effectiveness in pain management. Chronic pain is notoriously difficult to manage because it is largely subjective, and current assessment methods rely heavily on patient reported outcomes, which can be inconsistent and imprecise.

It uses closed loop tracking to ensure that that light reflected from each twisted heliostat is centered on a target point. This design allows for higher concentration of solar energy with better efficiency than conventional heliostats with a fixed shape. Researchers developed and tested a prototype to validate the twisting heliostat design.\n\nHeliostats are reflectors placed on rotating mounts capable of reflecting incoming sunlight to a target. Fields of heliostats are used to reflect sunlight towards a central point, concentrating the solar power reaching the field at that single spot as a method of solar energy generation. For each heliostat in a heliostat field to achieve the highest possible concentration, its reflector must be in a toroid shape. The ideal side lengths of this toroid vary depending on the angle of incident sunlight.\n\nStandard heliostats are capable of dual-axis rotation to continuously reflect the sun\u2019s rays to a target point but have fixed reflector shapes that cannot be changed to reflect changes in the angle of incident sunlight throughout the day. Additionally, many current heliostats operate on open loop tracking systems in which the ideal heliostat angle is calculated based on the heliostat\u2019s location on Earth and the relative positions of the Earth and Sun. While functional, these systems can\u2019t achieve a high level of precision since they can\u2019t account for uneven ground conditions or heliostat flaws and irregularities.

It enhances traditional identity verification methods by using occupation-specific questions. For instance, a doctor might be asked about medical terminology, while an accountant could face questions about financial regulations. By leveraging recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) and large language models like ChatGPT, it dynamically generates unique challenge questions tailored to the user's professional knowledge and experience, ensuring only those with genuine expertise can successfully authenticate. Occu-KBA also incorporates behavioral analytics, evaluating not just the correctness of answers but also how users interact with their devices while answering. This multi-factor approach enhances security, making it significantly harder to breach. The tool can seamlessly integrate with existing systems, providing a more personalized and secure user experience across various industries such as finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and government services. This solution effectively addresses the common challenges of traditional methods, such as forgotten answers and compromised databases, and offers robust protection against family-and-friends fraud. Traditional Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) methods that rely on static or dynamic challenge questions often suffer from issues such as users forgetting their answers, cumbersome processes, and the availability of compromised KBA answer databases on the dark web. Additionally, they typically employ a single-factor authentication approach, validating identities solely based on the correctness of answers, which can be inadequate against sophisticated fraud attempts. Current solutions include static KBA, where users answer pre-set questions (e.g., \"What is your first pet's name?\"), and dynamic KBA, which generates questions based on public records.

    "ip_description": "This invention introduces a novel metamaterial emitter system designed to enhance super-resolution imaging by leveraging the interaction between plasmonic nanoparticles and temperature-sensitive emitters, such as quantum dots. The plasmonic nanoparticle core is designed to efficiently produce localized heat upon excitation, which then interacts with an array of surrounding photosensitive emitters. The emitter uses two distinct excitation beams to allow for independent control of the excitations of the emitters and the heating of the core. By selectively filtering out the redshifted light, the system enables precise control and filtering of emitted wavelengths, which is essential for high-resolution optical imaging and sensing. This technology offers a new approach to super-resolution imaging, which has increasing importance in fields such as microscopy, optical sensing, and imaging. Super-resolution imaging breaks the diffraction limit to resolve structures at the nanometer scale. Conventional techniques, such as STED (Stimulated Emission Depletion) microscopy, rely on intricate optical setups and molecular photophysics, which often lead to lower efficiency and resolutions. By using temperature-sensitive emitters such as quantum dots instead of the fluorescent molecules used in STED, this technology provides improved resolution, efficiency, and adaptability for advanced imaging applications.

    "ip_description": "This technology integrates photonic crystals into digital micromirror devices (DMDs). The photonic crystals are incorporated on the surface of the DMD mirror in such a way as to achieve guided mode resonance, creating resonance features that are highly sensitive to changes in the angle of incidence. This increased sensitivity to angle changes minimizes the angular adjustments needed for a DMD to function, thereby reducing mirror travel distance and allowing for faster modulation while retaining precision. Digital micromirror devices (DMDs) consist of many microscopic mirrors which can be precisely moved and adjusted to modulate light and display rapidly changing images. They have a wide range of applications in devices including video projection, displays, and scientific instrumentation. Currently, they operate at a maximum frame rate of 10 kHz, limited by the mechanical speed at which the mirrors can be moved accurately and precisely. This technology, by reducing the required angular displacement for the mirrors, allows for faster, more efficient DMDs. Applications include Optical communications, Adaptive optics, Holography, Electronics and display systems, Telecommunications, Biomedical Engineering/Biotechnology, Aerospace, Automotive, and Defense. Advantages include Faster modulation, More efficient, Increased precision control, High sensitivity, and Increased storage density.",

    "ip_description": "Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes are the leading candidate for performing error correction in scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. This invention presents a Two-bit Bit Flipping Decoder Diversity (TBF) for quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, specifically targeting variable degree-3 QLDPC codes. By using a refined two-bit bit-flipping technique, this decoder improves error correction performance and reduces latency, which are critical for quantum applications. The approach is designed to handle complex configurations, such as trapping sets in hypergraph product codes, which typically lead to iterative decoding failures. This method adds an extra layer of precision by allowing the decoder to handle variable nodes with higher precision, enabling the correction of previously challenging error patterns more effectively than traditional bit-flipping methods.\n\nQuantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes have recently gained attention over topological codes due to their superior minimum distance and asymptotically scaling code rates. However, QLDPC codes impose long-range qubit connections that increase noise and add delays, restricting the latency available for decoding. Traditional decoders like belief propagation (BP) and min-sum (MS) struggle with handling trapping sets in QLDPC codes, leading to poor error correction performance, particularly in error-floor regions. The proposed method, adapted from classical error-correction techniques, addresses these issues by allowing greater flexibility in flipping decisions based on node states, making it a low-latency, high-performance solution for quantum applications. This framework allows multiple decoders to operate collectively, which enhances the error-correcting capabilities of QLDPC codes while maintaining computational efficiency.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a novel method and device for imaging and ranging through various types of optical fibers, including multi-mode and multi-core fibers. This technique allows for depth measurements and imaging without needing prior knowledge of the scene or the fiber's transmission matrix. By generating a \u201csynthetic wavefront\u201d through the computational combination of two wave fields at slightly different wavelengths, the method counteracts the phase scrambling effects that typically occur during light transmission through optical fibers. This approach offers tunable depth and lateral resolution over a wide range, making it highly versatile and applicable in medical imaging, industrial inspection, and other fields requiring fiberoptic endoscopy. Traditional methods of imaging and ranging through optical fibers often require complex wavefront shaping techniques and detailed knowledge of the fiber's transmission characteristics.

    "ip_description": "This invention encompasses a series of DNA-based antimicrobial compounds that prevent transmission of _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ (Ngo) during sexual intercourse and possibly treat an extant Ngo infection, alone or in combination with antibiotics, while leaving commensals unharmed. These DNA molecules are effective against low-passage antibiotic sensitive and resistant Ngo clinical isolates through a unique and experimentally proven mode of action. These \u201ckiller\u201d DNA molecules have the following attributes: They have defined nucleotide sequences with homology to genes essential for Ngo viability, linked to a DNA Uptake Sequence (DUS) that allows them to enter Ngo cells; and they are methylated differently than Ngo DNA. Upon entering Ngo, the \u201ckiller\u201d DNAs attempt to recombine with homologous sequences in the chromosome; restriction/methylation systems in the cell recognize the DNA heteroduplexes as foreign because of their mismatched methylation signatures and nick these complexes, leading to chromosome instability and ultimately cell death. These DNA molecules kill over 90% of input Ngo cells in both buffered media and commercially available personal lubricants. These first-in-class microbicides are designed to be incorporated into personal lubricants that can be applied topically by the user prior to sexual intercourse, or into lubricants on condoms. Gonorrhea is the second most reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI). Each year, _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ (Ngo) causes over 1.5 million new infections in the United States, and >87 million worldwide. The decades-long effort to develop a gonorrhea vaccine has been unsuccessful, and the ability of Ngo to rapidly develop antibiotic resistance greatly limits the effectiveness of antibiotics currently approved for treating gonorrhea. The effectiveness of the few antibiotics in the development pipeline will be short-lived: Ngo has already developed resistance to Zoliflodacin, an antibiotic in Phase 3 clinical trials. Prevention and treatment of gonorrhea remain elusive goals. This invention addresses these needs. These DNA-based antimicrobial compounds, introduced topically in gel form to the genital surfaces during sexual intercourse, kill Ngo thereby preventing transmission. They do not harm commensals. Because these DNAs are delivered via personal lubricants, they will require less time for FDA approval than ingested and injected compounds.",

The invention consists of algorithms that aim to accurately classify objects with varying softness and roughness into corresponding deformation or texture labels. By designing and implementing a sensor-based system which comprises feature extraction and a recognition module, the surgeon can detect texture (the roughness of a biological organ on its surface) and deformation (tissue hardness / softness). It integrates two microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors and a force-sensitive resistor (FSR) sensor attached to a thoracic grasper instrument. This innovation is compatible with the da Vinci MIS surgical system. Tactile feedback is crucial in RAMIS, especially for surgeons palpating subsurface tumors and other organ structures. This research introduces a novel approach to tactile perception in RAMIS, focusing on deformation and texture detection. The robotic technology employed in RAMIS allows for greater precision, flexibility, and control compared to traditional methods. However, even with its significant advancements in surgical practice, the lack of haptic feedback is a huge setback. Unlike traditional surgery, where surgeons can feel the tissues that they are manipulating, RAMIS currently lacks haptic feedback. This can make it more challenging for surgeons to assess tissue characteristics and apply the appropriate amount of force. By providing detailed tactile feedback, this sensor system allows surgeons to differentiate between various tissue types and textures, improving the accuracy of surgical manipulations.

There is a correlation and correspondence between quantum computing and quantum consciousness. The relationship between the Orch-OR theory of consciousness and Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) can be used in combination with quantum circuits mimicking microtubules to understand consciousness through human language acquisition. This is based upon a paper delivered at the Science of Consciousness conference and the technology is not reduced to practice.

    "ip_description": "This invention is an apparatus and method for controlling the motion of heliostats, which are mirrors that reflect sunlight towards a common target. For heliostats to be maximally efficient, they must be able to shift in orientation precisely as the Sun\u2019s relative position to the Earth changes. This technology utilizes a beamsplitter perpendicular to a heliostat reflector surface and to the incident and reflected rays of sunlight, as well as a camera that views both the sunlight transmitted through the beamsplitter and the sunlight reflected from the beamsplitter. By applying the law of reflection, the system ensures that the images of the sun and the target captured by the camera share a common center when the heliostat is correctly oriented. A computer processes these images to continuously adjust the heliostat\u2019s orientation, maintaining accurate targeting of the reflected sunlight. The integrated dual-axis mount and automatic mechanical shape adjustment significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of solar energy collection. Numerous heliostat tracking and orientation correction methods currently exist, including open loop methods, which calculate the necessary orientations of each heliostat in a tower or field based on relative positions of the Earth and Sun and the precise location of the heliostat. However, these methods are imprecise and cannot account for irregularities or imperfections in the heliostat, or for uneven or rocky ground beneath a heliostat tower or field. Closed loop methods of heliostat control, in which the heliostat\u2019s degree of unalignment is continuously calculated using sensors and cameras and then corrected, are more effective and precise than open loop methods, but many current methods require cameras with very wide fields of view, which have relatively low resolution and high distortion. This limits the accuracy of most current closed loop heliostat orientation control to greater than 1 milliradian milliseconds. This technology, using a camera in conjunction with a beamsplitter on the heliostat reflector, can achieve an accuracy of less than 0.5 milliradian milliseconds.",

    "ip_description": "Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes are the leading candidate for performing error correction in scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. This invention is a novel method and apparatus for collaborative decoders using QLDPC codes. These quantum decoders pass messages not only within the individual decoders that correct specific error types but also exchange information amongst each other to collaboratively correct multiple error types with excellent decoding performance and speed. Collaborative decoders using QLDPC codes will exchange information amongst each other in an iterative fashion aiding them to correct errors in larger numbers than the state-of-the-art decoder as well as in a faster way than when they work alone. This collaborative approach allows for the correction of multiple error types simultaneously, significantly increasing the number of correctable errors and enhancing the decoding speed compared to existing state-of-the-art decoders. Quantum computing is a rapidly growing field that can be used for more applications than classical computers, but it is prone to errors due to quantum decoherence and other noise sources. Error correction is crucial for the development of practical quantum computers. QLDPC codes are a leading candidate for error correction because of their efficiency and scalability. Traditional QLDPC decoders, however, face limitations in correcting errors quickly and effectively, especially when multiple types of errors occur. The collaborative decoders in this invention address these limitations by enabling decoders to share information and work together iteratively. This results in faster and more robust error correction, paving the way for more reliable and scalable quantum computing systems.",

This software utilizes VR to create immersive environments where trainees can practice various surgical procedures, particularly those involving intricate spatial anatomy like Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS). FESS presents challenges due to the tight operating space surrounded by delicate structures such as the brain and major blood vessels. The VR simulator addresses these challenges by allowing trainees to interact with realistic models of patient-specific anatomy, providing visual and audio cues to guide them through surgical steps. By using standard medical imaging data like computed tomography (CT) scans, the simulator accurately replicates the surgical environment, enabling trainees to identify critical structures and rehearse procedures before performing them on real patients. Studies have shown that this VR-based training system not only improves operational accuracy and efficiency, but also enhances patient safety by reducing the risk of errors during surgery. Traditional surgical training methods often rely on cadavers, textbooks, or observing live surgeries, which may not adequately prepare trainees for complex procedures like FESS, where precise spatial awareness is crucial. Current solutions include simulators that offer limited realism or software tools that lack immersive experiences. However, these methods often fall short in providing trainees with a realistic surgical environment and fail to accurately replicate patient-specific anatomy. The VR-based surgical simulator is a significant advancement as it offers a highly immersive and realistic training environment that addresses the limitations of current methods in surgical training.",

Researchers have identified novel plasma biomarkers indicative of neurodegeneration and inflammation in a mouse model of stroke, with particular emphasis on one significantly altered within 24 hours during stroke recovery: 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE). Arachidonic acid, released from cellular membranes upon encountering inflammatory stimuli, serves as the precursor for 12-HETE synthesis. These findings provide insight into the metabolic alterations in the plasma post-stroke and highlight the potential of arachidonic acid derivatives as biomarkers of inflammation. According to the Stroke Awareness Foundation, ischemic strokes are the most common type of stroke, accounting for about 87% of all cases. In one second, 32,000 brain cells die, and within 59 seconds, an ischemic stroke will have killed 1.9 million brain cells. The death of brain cells triggers a cascade of inflammatory responses, which can exacerbate damage. Annually, approximately 795,000 people experience a stroke in the United States alone, making ischemic stroke a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide. Despite its prevalence, there are currently no diagnostics or treatments specifically targeting inflammation after a stroke. This underscores the urgent need for advancements in diagnostic methodologies to improve patient outcomes. In particular, there is an urgent need for technology that can monitor inflammation after a stroke, as this inflammation may cause further neurodegeneration for weeks following the initial event. Investigating plasma biomarkers offers significant advantages in this endeavor. Plasma biomarkers can provide real-time insights into the dynamic inflammatory processes involved in ischemic strokes, enabling more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of treatment efficacy.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a novel method for measuring pressure inside the body without invasive procedures that combines ultrasound and laser technologies through the acousto-optic effect. By combining ultrasound and laser technologies, it offers a safe and accurate way to assess pressure levels in biological environments. An ultrasound wave is directed at the target area, such as the eye or brain tissue, which creates variable vibrations in the tissue depending on the internal pressure. At the same time, a laser beam is aimed at the vibrating tissue. When the ultrasound wave and laser light interact, they produce changes in the diffraction pattern of the laser light. These changes are linked to variations in the speed of sound, which correspond to changes in pressure. By analyzing the angle and intensity of the diffracted laser light, precise measurements of pressure at different depths and locations within the tissue can be obtained. This method is advantageous as it is non-invasive, eliminating the need for uncomfortable procedures such as measuring intraocular or intracranial pressure. With its potential applications in ophthalmology, neurology, and cardiology, this technology could significantly enhance patient care and medical diagnostics. Accurate pressure measurement is crucial in medical diagnostics, yet current methods often involve invasive procedures or rely on indirect measurements, leading to discomfort and potential risks for patients. Methods like tonometry in ophthalmology and lumbar punctures in neurology require invasive contact and have associated risks. Existing non-invasive methods, like cuff-based sphygmomanometers in cardiology, lack continuous or internal pressure measurements within vessels. This technology offers a non-invasive approach to measuring pressure in biological environments, such as the eye or brain tissue. By using the acousto-optic effect, it can precisely assess pressure at various depths and locations within the tissue. This innovation eliminates the discomfort and risks associated with current methods, providing safer, more accurate, and patient-friendly pressure measurements across different medical applications. Furthermore, the comfort and non-invasiveness of this technology would likely improve patient willingness to undergo these measurements, facilitating better disease management and monitoring.",

By administering ezetimibe, a commonly used drug, as a predictive diagnostic tool, healthcare providers can gauge the likelihood of treatment success for various medications. The key lies in measuring the levels of a specific metabolite, EZE-Gluc, in either urine or blood samples. This metabolite's behavior shifts in patients with Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH), affecting its elimination process. Normally eliminated through bile, in MASH patients, it tends to accumulate in plasma and urine instead. Understanding how EZE-Gluc behaves in MASH patients provides valuable insights into the functioning of crucial transport processes in the body. These processes not only impact the efficacy of ezetimibe but also influence the disposition of other drugs that share the same transport mechanisms. By conducting tests to assess EZE-Gluc levels before initiating treatment with drugs like pemetrexed, methotrexate, sorafenib, and others, healthcare providers can identify patients who might be at risk of adverse reactions or altered therapeutic outcomes. The technology addresses the challenge of predicting the effectiveness and potential adverse reactions of various drugs, particularly in patients with conditions like Metabolic dysfunction-Associated SteatoHepatitis (MASH).

    "published_date": "7/29/2024",
    "ip_description": "This invention is a novel method of surface and subsurface detection in geological environments by using the geometric phase of seismic waves as a function of acoustic frequency. This method has application for accurate detection of oil and gas deposits, as well as enabling industrial application in sensing and discovery that are unavailable from current active source methods. Green's functions can be obtained from cross correlation techniques when either the location of an acoustic source is known or when it is unknown. The geometric phase as a function of frequency is a sensitive indicator of the structure of surface and subsurface features in the geological environment. The sensitivity of geometric phase sensing provides unique advantages in the detection of features (e.g., oil and gas deposits, geological structures) compared to current active or passive source techniques that depend only on the amplitude of reflected and transmitted waves. Traditional seismic sensing methods predominantly use the amplitude of seismic waves to infer the presence and characteristics of subsurface features. However, these methods can be limited in their resolution and sensitivity, particularly in complex geological environments. The geometric phase of seismic waves, which changes with frequency, offers a more detailed picture of geological structures. This invention opens new opportunities for the detection of surface and subsurface features in the geological environment which will allow for accurate and robust detection of oil and gas deposits, among other subsurface and surface resources. The information available from the geometric phase as a function of frequency will enable industrial application in sensing and discovery that are unavailable from current active source methods.",

    "ip_description": "This innovation involves the development of a probe that attaches to a specific protein called cardiac troponin I (cTnI), which is involved in muscle contraction of the heart. This probe, created through genetic engineering techniques, is designed to detect changes in cTnI's neighboring protein, cardiac troponin T (cTnT). When there's a change in cTnT, it alters the environment around cTnI, which the probe can detect by changes in fluorescence. Essentially, the probe acts like a sensor that fluoresces when it detects certain changes in the heart muscle. The purpose of this innovation is to aid in the validation of potential drug candidates for treating a heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). By using this probe, researchers can observe how different drugs affect the interaction between cTnI and cTnT. This information helps in understanding the effectiveness of drugs in treating HCM, a condition characterized by thickening of the heart muscle, and may lead to the development of improved treatment options for patients with this condition. This technology is addressing the need for better methods to understand and treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is a condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, leading to potential complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure. Current solutions for studying HCM involve various methods, including genetic testing, imaging techniques like echocardiography, and medications to manage symptoms. However, these methods often fall short in providing a detailed understanding of the molecular changes underlying HCM and assessing the effectiveness of potential treatments. The innovation here lies in the development of a probe that specifically targets cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and detects changes in its neighboring protein, cardiac troponin T (cTnT), at a molecular level. This probe offers a more direct and precise method to monitor the interaction between these proteins, which is crucial in understanding the mechanisms of HCM and evaluating drug candidates. Unlike current methods, which may lack specificity or provide indirect measurements, this probe-based approach offers real-time, molecular-level insights into the dynamics of the heart muscle, potentially leading to more effective treatments for HCM. It provides a way to observe subtle changes in protein interactions that may not be easily detectable with conventional techniques, offering a promising avenue for both research and clinical applications in managing HCM.",

This technology is a novel method which yields a highly functional, low-cost branched polymer suitable for various thin film applications, including high refractive index coatings, transparent coatings, negative tone photoresists, optical adhesives, optical coatings, and photoresist platters. This innovation builds on existing sulfenyl chloride materials, originally developed for crosslinked, thermoset bulk optical glass lenses. This new material, referred to as \"disulfide glass,\" offers exceptional transparency and a high glass transition temperature. This method allows for the creation of pre-polymers from this disulfide glass that are not crosslinked, allowing for their use in coatings and other thin film applications. By adding triallyl isocyanurate, the process yields a soluble branched prepolymer with numerous vinyl-allyl groups that can be crosslinked using various methods like heat, UV light, or photolithography. This breakthrough results in the ability to produce polymer products with excellent optical and thermomechanical properties at a lower cost, replacing materials like SU8 in microelectronics fabrication. Polymerizations of sulfur monochloride and triallyl isocyanurate have already been shown to yield disulfide glasses with outstanding optical qualities superior to other plastics. The technology is addressing the need for high-quality optical materials that can be used in various applications, particularly in microelectronics fabrication.

Through the use of a unique modulation-free pattern approach, this metrology method can be used in outdoor environments. In the context of heliostats, deflectometry is employed to ensure that the mirrors are accurately aligned and properly shaped to reflect sunlight onto a central receiver in concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. The novel deflectometry method provides a relatively inexpensive solution to solar energy and can be used in large-scale applications. Heliostat mirrors play a crucial role in CSP systems by reflecting sunlight towards a central receiver. Accurate alignment and surface quality of these mirrors are essential for optimal system performance. Traditional metrology methods often struggle with environmental factors and the need for complex modulation techniques. To maximize heliostat efficiency and implement quality control, it is important to be able to accurately assess the surface of a heliostat mirror for bumps and irregularities.

Through trials varying the levels of _S. boulardii_ in combination with the traditional cultures, researchers successfully produced yogurt and kefir with acceptable characteristics in terms of taste, texture, and probiotic viability. These findings suggest that incorporating novel probiotics like _S. boulardii_ into mainstream dairy products could offer an effective means of enhancing probiotic consumption among the general population. As consumers increasingly seek ways to boost their probiotic intake for improved gut health, they have few options for probiotic yeasts, particularly in food and beverages. Current options predominantly focus on bacterial probiotics, such as supplements or foods containing bacterial strains like _Lactobacillus_ and _Bifidobacterium_.

The rate of global warming since 1982 is approximately three times as fast as the rate from 1850 to the present, and record-high temperatures are being recorded across the globe, with 2023 being the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The impacts of rising temperatures are felt much more strongly in urban environments due to the urban heat island effect, which is a phenomenon in which cities experience significantly higher temperatures than their surrounding suburban and rural areas.",

    "published_date": "8/5/2024",
    "ip_description": "The invention is an improved optical storage media system designed to increase storage capacity on optical media, such as compact discs. This system encodes data by varying the width of pits on the disc, allowing each pit to represent multiple bits of information. By exploiting the diffraction properties of light, this technology employs angular-selective thin film coatings that filter diffracted light based on its angle. With the integration of a multiplex detector array, this approach allows for the encoding of multiple bits of information and enables precise determination of pit widths and the encoded data, resulting in higher storage density compared to traditional optical storage media, which typically encode data based solely on the presence or absence of pits. Traditional optical storage media, like CDs and DVDs, encode data using binary pits and lands on their surfaces. The presence or absence of pits represents binary data (0s and 1s), which limits the amount of data that can be stored. To overcome this limitation, this invention utilizes pits of varying widths to encode multiple bits of data in each pit. Additionally, with the rise of cloud storage and high-capacity flash drives, optical storage media has seen a decline in popularity. One problem with this type of storage is limited storage capacity compared to newer technologies. Optical storage mediums have slower data transfer processing. This invention offers a new approach to data storage without compromising the basic writing mechanism. The technology incorporated in the invention could significantly improve existing optical media which could pave the way for development of new optical devices that are more compact, efficient, and cost-effective.",

    "published_date": "6/17/2024",
    "ip_description": "This invention is a novel method of modifying complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chips to detect polarization data. This technology aims to revolutionize polarization imaging by leveraging the existing infrastructure of CMOS technology through converting metallic wires in the back end of the line of a CMOS chip into linear polarizers (wire grid polarizers) or chiral metamaterials for circular polarizers. In doing so, the device can fully describe the polarization state of light. This is achieved by integrating polarizing components directly into the sensor array, allowing for compact and efficient polarization imaging. This data can then be processed to detect details and properties of an object being imaged that are undetectable with standard imaging methods. Current methods of polarization imaging often require bulky external filters, while this technology is compact and requires no external filters. Additionally, this technology is capable of simultaneously capturing multiple polarization states in real time, allowing for it to be utilized in live imaging applications. Polarization imaging provides valuable information beyond the scope of standard imaging methods, and it is a widely used technique across many fields. However, current methods of polarization imaging require additional external filters to be added to a preexisting imaging device. These filters are often expensive and large, and they typically are not able to simultaneously capture multiple polarization states. This technology aims to solve these problems, making polarization imaging more compact, efficient, and versatile by incorporating polarization imaging technology into the CMOS chips.",

    "ip_description": "Contrary to the common belief that quantum entanglement is destroyed by amplification, in entanglement-assisted communication systems dominated by attenuation effects rather than noise, the signal photons can be amplified by the erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) without destroying the entanglement. The inventors developed a terrestrial free-space optical (FSO) testbed at the University Arizona campus by establishing 1.5 km long FSO link. They demonstrated that an amplified entanglement assisted communication system at 10 Gb/s operated in strong turbulence regime significantly outperforms amplified classical laser communication link operated in medium turbulence regime. This demonstration validated entanglement assisted communication over long-range terrestrial FSO links.  \n\nEntanglement represents a unique quantum information property that enables quantum sensing approaching the Heisenberg limit, the communication beating the Shannon limit, and secure communications with security guaranteed by the quantum mechanics laws rather than computational complexity. The quantum communication over terrestrial free-space optical (FSO) channels is severely affected by absorption, diffraction, scattering, and atmospheric turbulence effects. It is widely believed that entangled photons cannot be amplified by a classical amplifier, such as the EDFA, without destroying the quantum entanglement. However, the inventors' demonstration has shown that in highly noisy and lossy environments, the entanglement assisted communication systems dominated by attenuation effects rather than noise, the signal photons can be amplified by the EDFA without destroying the entanglement.",

    "published_date": "7/1/2024",
    "ip_description": "This technology is a novel method of integrating vibrant colors into solar panels and cells without significantly compromising their performance. This is achieved through innovative optical coatings and structures that create narrowband resonances, allowing for selective color reflection or transmission while maintaining high levels of light absorption for energy conversion. Fano Resonant Optical Coatings (FROCs) provide coloration to amorphous solar cells and solar thermal panels, and guided mode resonances provide coloration to crystalline solar cells. This technology has diverse applications in the solar panel industry as it can be used on crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, and thermal solar panels. By making it possible to manufacture solar panels in a wide range of colors, this technology could enable the use of solar panels on buildings for which aesthetics are important design considerations. Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) can now be seamlessly incorporated into architectural designs without detracting from the building's appearance. Similarly, consumer products powered by photovoltaics, such as portable chargers and wearables, can now enjoy a wider range of colors without sacrificing efficiency. Additionally, this technology could allow for portable solar powered devices to be available in many color options. Solar panels may be overlooked as an option in buildings where aesthetics matter. Traditional solar panels are typically dark and uniform in color to maximize light absorption and energy conversion. However, the aesthetic limitations have restricted their use in various applications where appearance matters. Making them available in a variety of vibrant colors rather than the typical black or blue could allow for solar panels to more easily blend in with and complement a building\u2019s design, which could lead to more widespread solar panel use. Solar panels in different colors are already available, but most are enabled by thin-film filters rather than the optical coatings used in this technology, and they currently tend to come with significant reductions in efficiency and at high prices.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is an entanglement-based continuous variable-quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) scheme that performs information reconciliation over the entanglement assisted communication link. The same entanglement generation source is used in both raw key transmission and information reconciliation. Experimental demonstrations over the free\u2010space optical testbed established at the University of Arizona campus indicate that the proposed CV\u2010QKD scheme with information reconciliation over the entanglement assisted link significantly outperforms corresponding CV-QKD scheme with information reconciliation over the authenticated public channel. It also outperforms the CV\u2010QKD scheme in which classical free\u2010space optical communication link is used to perform the information reconciliation, and was found to operate in strong turbulence regime. Strong turbulence regime poses different technical challenges with quantum communications technologies in areas such as terrestrial free-space optical links, uplink to high-altitude platform systems (HAPS), uplink/downlink to/from satellites, near-Earth applications, and underwater communications, to mention a few. Entanglement, or the strong correlation between particles, as used in quantum communication can help beat classical channel capacities, achieve better than classical sensors sensitivity, and provide quantum-mechanics based security. Different photon degrees of freedom can be utilized in QKD including polarization, time, frequency, phase, and orbital angular momentum. Among different QKD protocols, discrete variable (DV)\u2010QKD and continuous variable (CV)\u2010QKD are very popular ones. In DV\u2010QKD schemes, a single photon detector (SPD) is applied, while CV\u2010QKD relies on uncertainty principle. With CV\u2010QKD one can achieve higher secret key rates (SKRs) compared to corresponding DV\u2010QKD schemes thanks to its compatibility with the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art telecom optical communications. Applications include covert communication, cybersecurity, telecommunications, banking and financial services, and data securitization. Advantages include outperforming other CV-QKD schemes, using the same source for both raw key transmission and information reconciliation, and the ability to operate in strong turbulence regime.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a device which applies bioelectrical impedance (BIA) principles to the breast for an estimate of breast density in order to provide a new screening tool for detection of breast cancer. BIA technology is applied to the limited area of breast as opposed to whole body measurements commonly used to assess adiposity. The goal of the breast BIA device is to reduce breast cancer health disparities by enabling a \"pre-screening\" of breast density (without radiation) that would indicate whether standard mammography screening should be undertaken. Populations particularly targeted will be those in low resource settings as well as younger (under age of 40) Hispanic and African American women who have a higher prevalence of early onset breast cancer.\n\nBIA is most commonly used for whole body assessment of excess adiposity, i.e. obesity. BIA is not currently used as a screening tool for breast cancer, though breast tissue is largely made up of fat and water. Mammography is the current clinical standard for breast cancer risk assessment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessed breast density works on the principles of fat and water and is being developed as an alternative to mammography for breast cancer risk assessment. MRI does not introduce radiation whereas mammography screening does introduce radiation. There is no radiation exposure with BIA either. In fact, BIA current is imperceptible and no side effects have been demonstrated; it is essentially non-invasive. BIA also has the advantage of being able to be small and highly portable and, therefore, amenable to field screenings which are important for rural areas and other underserved populations.",

The core idea is to utilize nanomembranes which are ~50-100 nm thick suspensions on the order of a few mm squared. The membranes can be made of silicon or its derivatives. Moreover, they are produced on a wafer scale. The fact that they are thin allows them to be patterned with ebeam lithography or focused ion beam milling where etched portions are holes which allow the transmission of EUV wavelengths. This invention addresses a critical bottleneck in advanced CMOS node development by providing a more efficient and cost-effective solution for EUV lithography. EUV lithography faces challenges due to its reliance on reflective optics, which complicates system alignment, increases footprint, and limits flexibility. The current EUV lithography tools are not only extremely expensive, often costing billions of dollars, but also complex and large. By introducing a suspended nanomembrane-based system with diffractive optical elements and transmission masks, this technology has the potential to significantly reduce the cost and complexity of EUV lithography, making it more accessible and scalable for semiconductor manufacturing.

These cell lines, derived from UV-induced cSCC tumors in BALB/c mice, recapitulate the mutational signature and driver mutations found in human cSCC. Developing the cell lines from an inbred mouse strain allows for studies involving antigen-specific T cell responses, as the major histocompatibility complex alleles are the same between mice. Additionally, the ability to intradermally transplant the cSCC tumors into mice drastically reduces the length of time needed for experimentation, as UV induction of cSCC takes months. This innovation provides researchers with invaluable tools for studying cSCC and exploring potential treatments and drug development. There is a lack of clinically relevant UV-induced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) murine models that can be used to study antigen-specific T cell responses. Other cSCC mouse models require long periods of time to create, cannot be used to evaluate certain T cell responses, and/or may not recapitulate the mutational signature and burden of human disease.

Analysis of Ce3+-doped BASL glass samples properties confirmed the absence of both strong concentration quenching and Ce3+ oxidation. This Ce3+-doped BASL glass has multiple special applications in advanced photonics manufacturing, laser applications, as well as high energy radiation and particle detection and visualization, medical imaging, radiation-resistant components and devices, neutrino and dark matter detectors, illumination, holography, fiber-optic and magneto-optic devices. Among glass materials, only silicate glasses generally show favorable mechanical properties, chemical durability, thermal shock resistance and thermodynamic stability, making them generally more convenient to handle. However, their doping level is limited due to the facile transition from Ce3+ to Ce4+ during glass melting. Heavy metal oxide, fluoride, or chalcogenide glass materials have more favorable spectral properties, but they are very hard to handle, produce in large volumes and/or dope with high Ce3+ content while maintaining high emission efficiency. Therefore, they have limited benefits compared to crystalline materials. Trivalent cerium (Ce3+)-doped materials possess extraordinary optical and physical properties including no absorption transitions across the entire visible and near-infrared wavelength region (400-3500 nm), broadband UV and visible luminescence (250-700 nm), large Verdet constant, high resistance to radiation and photo-darkening and high scintillation yield. Although photonic devices based on highly Ce3+-doped crystals and films have seen significant progress, their fabrication processes are expensive, complex and time-consuming particularly when compared with glass, and their applications are also restricted by the drawbacks of crystals and films, such as small apertures, brittleness and anisotropy. These shortcomings are addressed by the newly developed Ce3+-doped BASL glass.",

It can be used in visible spectrum with several systems including digital camera, MRI, infrared, etc. This solution improves upon the process by addressing the root cause of these traditional strategies through advanced Fourier Computed Tomography techniques. A physics-based sampling strategy that overcomes spectral biases inherent in classical spherical sampling methods ensures more accurate reconstructions, particularly in capturing specular reflections and intricate details. The system achieves a reconstruction PSNR score of 44.0458641dB and SSIM score of 0.990, surpassing previous benchmarks and setting a new standard for fidelity and realism in 3D scene representation. The technology aims to address the limitations of current regression-based radiance field reconstruction strategies, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). These methods often fall short when it comes to capturing high-frequency details and reflective surfaces, leading to unwanted artifacts in reconstructed images, diminishing the realism and fidelity of the scene. The primary issue lies in the spectral bias towards reconstructing low-frequency functions, resulting in a lack of fidelity and realism in the final scenes. Current solutions utilize classical spherical sampling techniques, but these introduce inherent spectral biases due to inhomogeneous sampling of the Fourier domain. This leads to compromised reconstruction quality and unsatisfactory results, particularly in capturing specular reflections and fine details. RIFT enables high-fidelity, anisotropic radiance field reconstruction, ensuring accurate representation of intricate details and reflective surfaces. Applications include Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), 3D imaging, Digital image processing, Architectural visualization and design, Laser optics, and Medical imaging and simulations.

Kindness interventions tend to focus on the individual and the routine integration of kindness learning and practice at the organizational and community levels is lacking. Because kindness is interactional and is communicated between people and groups, a social-ecological approach to intervention is needed. The relationship between prosocial acts and health have been evaluated through multiple studies over the last few decades. One analysis of 12 studies with a focus on acts of kindness, found that acts of kindness were associated with improved health outcomes. Relying on this finding, multiple methods to analyze the intervention to determine effectiveness of these methods. This new method involves the use of researched pre-evaluation services coupled with digital tracking to foster intervention from afar.",

This invention not only recognizes the higher demand of iron that characterizes cancer cells, but also takes into account other physiological differences between malignant cells and the surrounding tissue. Specifically, pro-drugs are designed to activate into iron chelating agents within the reducing environment of the cytoplasm of cancer cells. The pro-chelators may be used to target malignant cells or in the treatment in a condition associated with metal ion dysregulation. The pro-chelators may be conjugated to a carbohydrate moiety, which may increase their selectivity for cells that overexpress glucose transporters, for example malignant cells.\n\nBasic and clinical research has improved significantly the prognosis and number of treatment options for cancer patients in the past decades. Broad-spectrum cytotoxins and their unwanted side effects, however, continue to be part of cancer chemotherapy in the clinical practice. Current research efforts are responding to the pressing need for more targeted, less toxic treatment options. Such approaches are necessarily based on new or previously overlooked information on the genetic and/or metabolic makeup of cancer cells, particularly on peculiarities that differentiate them from normal cells within the same tissue. We pursue the molecular design of strategies to study and exploit an aspect of cancer metabolism that is not targeted by current clinical chemotherapy, namely the altered iron metabolism of malignant cells.\n\nIn order to sustain their rapid proliferation rates, cancer cells require higher iron content when compared to normal cells. As such, the use of small-molecule scavengers (chelators) of iron ions could deprive cancer cells of this essential supply, thereby slowing or halting cancer growth. Indeed, chelation therapy has been employed clinically for decades in cases of iron overload conditions associated with genetic disorders, such as thalassemia and hemochromatosis. The key to the success of chelation therapy in cancer treatment, however, is the ability to target iron ions in malignant cells without affecting iron levels in the bloodstream and in normal tissue. Lacking such selectivity, currently available chelators were found to elicit adverse side effects when employed in the context of cancer research.\n\nApplications:\n*   Intracellular iron chelation, targeted at cancer therapy\n*   Treatment of metal ion dysregulation, including iron overload\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Reduce proliferation of malignant cells\n*   Improve selectivity for iron chelation within malignant cells\n*   Targeted treatment for iron overload",

    "ip_description": "This invention involves swept back wings that use Leading-Edge Vortex (LEV) for more controlled improvements of fixed wing aircraft. The technology enables a greater lift force and better aeronautical stability. Additional testing has shown that introducing a crank or a protuberance in the leading edge can initiate the process of vortex liftoff at lower incidence angles, expanding the operational range of the wing before stall conditions are met. Moreover, the use of a high-speed, small jet has demonstrated the potential to delay the vortex liftoff and alter its trajectory, thereby mitigating buffet and enhancing pitch and yaw control. Research conducted on tailless airplane models with swept-back wings has revealed that a Leading-Edge Vortex (LEV) formed on these wings has a significant impact on their pressure distribution, consequently influencing the various forces and moments acting on the wing, such as lift, drag, pitch, yaw, and roll. When the wing is at a low angle of attack, the LEV remains concentrated around the Leading Edge (LE) area. However, as the angle of attack increases, the LEV detaches from the LE, changes its orientation, and periodically moves outward, causing substantial pressure fluctuations that can lead to flutter. Time-resolved smoke images and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) have provided new insights into the periodicity of the vortex liftoff, a phenomenon not previously observed and often assumed to be steady in computational simulations. This research has highlighted the dynamic nature of the LEV and its critical role in the aerodynamic performance of swept-back wings.",

This exceptional sensitivity is achieved through the utilization of ferrocene-containing polymeric coatings created via RAFT polymerization, which enhance selectivity for the target analyte, nitric oxide. The system, known as the Frequency Locked Optical Whispering Evanescent Resonator (FLOWER), tracks the real-time shifts in resonance with sub-femtometer resolution as nitric oxide gas is introduced, allowing for both reversible and irreversible sensing within a concentration range of 6.4 ppt to 240 ppt and even higher concentrations. Notably, the device also exhibits robust resistance to humidity, maintaining its sensing performance effectively up to 47% humidity. The study evaluates the impact of different chemical compositions and molecular weights of the ferrocene-containing polymeric coatings on sensing performance. This invention represents a significant advancement in gas sensing technology, enabling the detection of extremely low concentrations of nitric oxide with high precision and selectivity. Systems for the selective and rapid detection of gases are important tools used to monitor environmental impacts, occupational safety, and human biomarkers. Nitric oxide is a common byproduct of vehicle exhaust and industrial processes involving combustion, making it a major emission contributing to ozone layer depletion. In addition to its environmental impacts, nitric oxide also serves as an important biomarker of respiratory health associated with asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Furthermore, nitric oxide is easily oxidized in air to nitrogen dioxide, which is highly corrosive, toxic, and a danger to human respiratory health. To mitigate injury due to gas exposure and monitor the environmental impacts of industrial processes, selective sensors for nitric oxide detection must be developed and deployed. Current solutions for nitric oxide detection typically rely on various methods, including chemiluminescence, electrochemical sensors, and optical sensors such as cavity ring-down spectroscopy. However, these methods often struggle to achieve the level of sensitivity and selectivity needed for accurately measuring trace concentrations of nitric oxide in complex environments.

A microcontroller is used to deliver pulsed injections from a large sample loop onto a SEC for online CD-MS analysis. The method produces a series of peaks spaced according to the pseudo-random injection sequence, which are demultiplexed with a Hadamard transform algorithm. This improves CD-MS signals while preserving the retention time information. This multiplexing approach provides a general solution to the inherent incompatibilities of online separations and CD-MS detection that will enable a range of applications.\n\nCharge detection mass spectrometry (CD-MS) is a powerful technique for the analysis of large, heterogeneous biomolecules. By directly measuring the charge states of individual ions, CD-MS can produce accurate mass measurements from spectra where conventional deconvolution approaches fail due to the lack of isotopic resolution or distinguishable charge states. CD-MS has found applications in the characterization of very large (up to tens of mega-Daltons (MDa)) biomolecules such as protein complexes, intact virus capsids, vaccines, and gene therapies. Growing needs in biotechnology and the introduction of commercial instruments has led to increased interest in analyzing large, heterogeneous biomolecules. CD-MS is limited in that only a small number of ions can be measured at a time, which necessitates the acquisition of many hundreds or thousands of spectra to provide enough detection events for accurate mass measurements with acceptable signal to noise ratios. These long acquisitions generally prevent the coupling of CD-MS with online (i.e., real-time) separation techniques, such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC), which typically only provide enough time for 50-200 scans during the elution of a chromatographic peak. Progress has been made on this front by refining CD-MS instrumentation to enable the measurement of multiple ions simultaneously and improve charge state assignments with deconvolution algorithms. However, a recent effort to evaluate the feasibility of online SEC-CD-MS produced deconvolved mass spectra that, while sufficient to measure accurate protein masses, had lower signal-to-noise ratios and contained significantly more erroneous peaks than spectra produced from infusion experiments. Accordingly, there remains a need to develop methods, and apparatuses containing a device, for improved acquisition of analytical data for very large, heterogeneous biomolecules and/or microorganisms.\n\nApplications:\n*   Biomolecule design and characterization\n*   Bio-based product development for therapeutics or diagnostics\n*   QC, forensics\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Improved signal-to-noise while preserving retention time information\n*   Improvement to CD-MS methods",

    "ip_description": "This technology is directed to a method of treating fibrosis and cancer by targeting circulating cells. Researchers identified mechanoresponsive myeloid subpopulations present in fibrotic and healthy tissue. Certain subpopulations of circulating cells have been implicated in the processes of cancer and fibrosis. These subpopulations are subsequently modulated by manipulating mechanical strain _in vivo_ and _in vitro_ and find that specifically targeting a certain type of signaling is sufficient to reduce the pro-fibrotic subpopulations and instead restore the native, anti-inflammatory subpopulations. Injury in all organs comprises of a coordinated process involving resident cells of the injury area as well as cells recruited from the circulation. Many recent studies have examined the importance of tissue resident fibroblast heterogeneity and mechanical signaling in healing and fibrosis. However, tissue repair also involves blood cells, part of the inflammatory response, that are recruited from the circulation. While the vast majority of circulating cells are immune cells, a rare population of cells have been identified in mammalian blood samples over two decades ago. However, since their initial description, the function, long term fate, and impact of these rare cells on peripheral tissues has been elusive. This technology seeks to explore the impact of modulation of these cells, specifically as it relates to inflammation in fibrosis and cancer. Applications include Fibrosis disease states such as Renal fibrosis, Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), Scleroderma, Liver Cirrhosis, Cancer, and Proliferative disease. Advantages include applicability to multiple organ systems and a large range of applicable disorders.",

    "ip_description": "This technology represents a new class of scintillation materials based on metal organic frameworks (MOFs), highly crystalline and tunable structures, which may provide higher detection efficiency compared to other particle scintillation materials. Furthermore, the use of fluorophores with these MOFs paves the way for more versatile applications in the realm of radioisotope detection. The unique combination enhances signal clarity, reducing background noise and increasing overall sensitivity. This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize methods and protocols in research fields requiring precise radioisotope detection. Radioisotopes are used in clinical diagnosis, therapy of various medical conditions, environmental analyses, nuclear systems, and research in both the physical and life sciences. This involves the investigation of low-energy radiation emitting atoms in chemical solutions. To investigate these, however, requires techniques of detection that are currently cumbersome or unreliable. This is due to the inherent low energy emission making the atoms hard to detect in the first place as well as their weak emissions being unable to penetrate through much of the solution. The method described here is a novel and tunable chemical platform that provides a new strategy to detect low energy radioisotopes in aqueous solutions. The tunable platform enables highly efficient detection compared to other materials. Traditional methods of investigation require techniques of detection that are currently cumbersome or unreliable. Challenges arise due to the inherent low energy emission making the atoms hard to detect in the first place, compounded by their weak emissions being unable to penetrate through much of the solution. The fluorophore-doped MOF approach outlined in this technology not only addresses these challenges but offers a superior alternative. Applications include radioisotope detection and measurement, medical diagnostics, therapeutics, environmental analyses, nuclear systems analyses, and research. Advantages include increased efficiency, enhanced doping homogeneity, and enhanced precision.",

These approaches can lead to inefficiencies, such as delays between image captures or missed observations due to manual handling of equipment, and possible delays in handling real-time adjustments when new observation priorities arise. The Acquisition subsystem improves upon these issues by automating the entire process, ensuring that the telescope and camera are working together seamlessly. It prioritizes observations, manages telescope movements, and overlaps tasks like image downloads and focusing to maximize efficiency. The system can also adjust dynamically to new requests, making it faster and more responsive than traditional methods. This streamlined approach reduces downtime and increases the likelihood of capturing critical data, making it a more effective tool for NEO detection and tracking. Applications: Near-Earth Object detection and tracking, Astronomical survey operations, Space exploration and observation. Advantages: Automates telescope and camera operations for greater efficiency, Reduces downtime by overlapping tasks like image downloads and telescope movement, Adapts in real-time to new observation requests and priorities, Supports research in alignment with NASA's Open-Source Data Management Plan.",

    "ip_description": "The Processing subsystem in the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) software suite is a streamlined pipeline designed to handle raw images captured by telescopes during asteroid and Near-Earth Object (NEO) surveys. This pipeline processes the images through multiple stages, such as calibrating for optical distortions, extracting star or asteroid positions, and converting these positions into standard astronomical coordinates. By automating the process, the system allows multiple operations to occur simultaneously, improving efficiency and speeding up data analysis. The CSS pipeline incorporates widely used astronomical techniques and public-domain software to ensure accuracy and reliability. While the processing module handles all necessary steps for image analysis, it does not include moving object detection, which is released separately. The system applies filters to identify known asteroids, NEOs, or satellites, allowing for accurate reporting of new potential discoveries. All detections that successfully emerge from the moving object detection pipeline are presented to an observer for final validation running under Control. This technology aligns with NASA's Open-Source Data Management Plan to support global research in tracking hazardous asteroids. Processing large volumes of astronomical data to efficiently identify and track asteroids and Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) is challenging. Current solutions in NEO surveys often involve manual intervention or slower processing pipelines, which can delay the identification of new objects or overlook faint objects. These existing methods can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and may not allow for simultaneous handling of multiple operations, limiting their overall effectiveness in planetary defense. The CSS Processing subsystem improves on these issues by automating the image processing pipeline, enabling faster and more accurate data handling. Unlike traditional methods, it can perform multiple operations at once, such as calibrating for distortions and extracting object positions, speeding up the overall workflow. Its ability to filter out known objects and focus on potential new discoveries also reduces unnecessary data clutter. This approach streamlines the detection process and provides a more efficient way to analyze the vast amounts of data generated by NEO surveys.",

It gathers data from various public sources, such as the Minor Planet Center and other NEO survey programs, to provide a clear and prioritized summary of which objects require further observation. This allows CSS observers to focus on the most important objects, ensuring efficient use of resources and reducing the risk of missing significant discoveries. The system displays this information on an internal webpage, improving coordination between telescopes and enabling quick updates on new or ongoing observations. By making this data accessible and easy to track, the monitor subsystem supports global research efforts, aligning with NASA's Open-Source Data Management Plan to aid other researchers in the search for potentially hazardous asteroids. The technology addresses the challenge of effectively tracking and monitoring Near-Earth Objects that could pose a collision threat to Earth. Current solutions rely on various global NEO surveys, but many face limitations in data coordination, observation prioritization, and ensuring that enough observations are made to determine accurate orbits. As a result, significant discoveries can sometimes be overlooked, and important NEOs may not receive timely follow-up observations. The CSS Monitor subsystem improves upon these issues by consolidating data from multiple sources into a single, prioritized interface, making it easier for observers to focus on high-priority objects. Unlike other systems that may not prioritize actions or streamline updates efficiently, this software highlights critical objects and prevents recent discoveries from being missed. This system enhances coordination between observatories and ensures that resources are used effectively, addressing gaps in current monitoring methods.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a solid-set irrigation bubbler head sprinkler system designed to replace existing low-output sprinkler heads commonly used in agricultural fields. The design of the system directs the water downward to guide it toward the soil while simultaneously controlling the flow to prevent soil erosion. This innovation allows for more precise flooding of fields and precise fertilizer applications. The solution devised by the team at Yuma County Cooperative Extension promises to significantly improve the efficiency of flood irrigation for secondary crops, leading to more sustainable and productive agricultural practices in Arizona and beyond. Historically, secondary crops have relied on \u201cbasin flood irrigation,\u201d a low-cost method that flattens the land and opens a single canal gate to flood the field gradually. This is crucial not only for providing the necessary water and nutrients to the crops but also for dissolving and washing away accumulated salt. However, the challenge with traditional flood irrigation has been uneven water distribution across the field, with more water infiltrating near the canal gate and less at the opposite end. This leads to suboptimal crop growth, as well as salt accumulation in some areas, which can be detrimental to crop health. By replacing low-output sprinkler heads, this innovation enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of flood irrigation, promoting healthier crop growth and reducing the environmental impact associated with excessive water and fertilizer use. Applications include agricultural irrigation, pre-irrigation, and salt leaching. Advantages include enabling accurate, faster, more even water distribution across fields, more efficient field flooding, nutrient application, and salt removal, faster irrigation sets, less overall water use, healthier crop growth from more consistent and reliable irrigation, and compliance with sustainable farming practices and irrigation efficiency standards.",

The key idea is to use an incoherent line light source with a rectangular aperture to generate light sheet illumination and detect the scattered light from the illuminated tissue plane to generate images. The use of line illumination and rectangular aperture provides a small illumination light sheet width over a large field of view, while reducing the speckle noise and shadow artifacts. This innovative approach towards the design of this microscope promises enhanced clarity and precision in imaging. Given its affordability, this invention is poised to revolutionize diagnostic procedures in various medical settings, especially in regions with limited access to advanced medical equipment. Light sheet microscopy (LSM) is a relatively new microscopy technology used in basic life science research. LSM uses separate optical paths for illumination and detection, where the illumination optics determine the axial resolution, and the detection optics determine the lateral resolution. This invention can be used to develop low-cost, small form-factor light sheet microscopy devices for diagnosing diseases of human internal organs in vivo and freshly excised specimens ex vivo, including anus, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and colon. The microscope device can be used in a wide range of clinical settings (including primary-care clinics, surgical suites, and under-resourced remote hospitals without pathology services), as well as for training and educational purposes. Furthermore, the advancements in LSM technology, combined with the unique features of this invention, present a transformative opportunity.

    "ip_description": "This invention consists of the design and embodiments of a statically optical see through head-mounted displays (OST-HMDs) in which the angular pixel density decreases with the increase of the filed eccentricity according to a specified angular pixel density function. To facilitate the head-mounted display capability to simultaneously see the image rendered by a display and the view go the real-world scene, a freeform prism is utilized as the optical combiner to merge the optical paths of the virtual image display and real-world view. The implementation of the described features creates minimally perceivable image artifacts and image resolution discontinuity and may further eliminate or limit the need for an eye tracker or scanning mechanism. Head-mounted displays (HMDs) have been created for numerous effective purposes, including training, medical education, navigation, and various other applications. Traditional HMD configurations utilize the widely accepted rectilinear sampling approach, which is primarily employed in 2D display and imaging systems. As a result of using such configurations, conventional HMD are subject to the inherent trade-off between field of view (FOV) and resolution. To alleviate the trade-off between FOV and resolution, a foveated display, inspired by the foveation properties of the human eye, can be generally defined as a method that identifies a user's region of interest (ROI) and allocates limited resources, such as a finite number of pixels or data processing and transmission bandwidth, differently between the ROI and the peripheral area outside the ROI region.",

    "ip_description": "The invention is a dampened flexure mount capable of enhancing the vibration isolation of highly sensitive equipment, including optics, aerospace, and space applications. The mount\u2019s improved dampening capability arises from the incorporation of two or more materials in its design, where one imparts rigidity, while the other imparts flex dampening properties. The design adopts the concept of constrained layer damping. Here, a viscoelastic material is sandwiched between the mount and a rigid constraining layer. Vibrational energy, instead of adversely impacting the equipment, causes shearing in the viscoelastic layer. Over time, this vibrational energy transforms into heat in the viscoelastic layer, ensuring the vibrations do not disturb the equipment\u2019s operation. The design has a Z flexure as well as X and Y, so it is quasi-kinematic in all axes. Flexural mounts are commonly employed, particularly in optics, to create quasi-kinematic supports for components. In most optical applications, the environmental conditions are often benign. However, in scenarios where applications must endure harsh vibrations, such as during a space launch, it is often desirable to attenuate this excitation originating from the base of the structure to protect the delicate optics, detectors, and other supported components. The challenge lies in achieving the right balance between rigid support and damping capabilities. Over the years, many efforts have been made to address this concern, but finding an optimal solution that can cater to both the precision required by optical components and the durability needed to withstand intense vibrations remains a challenge. The key advantage of this type of mount is its monolithic (i.e., one-piece) construction, which precisely holds a component in place in perfect equilibrium without excessive constraint.",

The improvement is that this technology can use previous RF maps as inputs and with the help of sophisticated artificial intelligence, produce new areas or new capabilities with the requirement of significant field measurements. This inventive method presents a valuable solution for efficiently generating RF maps and overcoming the complexities associated with site surveys, ray tracing, and other existing techniques. This technology can be used in any type of synthesizing heat maps, such as, weather heat maps, heat maps in biological imaging, etc., as well as for enhanced network planning, interference coordination, resource allocation, and localization. Collecting RF data and conducting site surveys to construct RF maps is both time-consuming and labor-intensive due to the complex and dynamic nature of the wireless environment and the many of factors that can affect signal propagation, including building material, terrain, and interference. The technology is expected to achieve half the error rate of existing technologies. The process of constructing RF maps becomes even more complex at high frequencies (e.g., millimeter-wave band), as many configurations must be investigated. Alternative state-of-the-art techniques for RF map generation rely on ray-tracing approaches. Besides their high computational complexity, ray-tracing approaches mainly require precise description of the objects in the RF environment along with their electromagnetic properties. Applications include Networking and telecommunications, Aerospace and defense, Cartography, and Heat mapping in various industries.

    "ip_description": "This invention comprises a class of tetrazolium-based prochelators for targeting and binding intracellular iron and thereby interfere in cancer cell proliferation or other iron dysregulation. The redox potential of various analogues within this class of compounds can be tuned for targeting of cancer cells. Following cellular uptake, the tetrazolium compounds of the present invention undergo reduction to produce formazan species that are capable of intracellular binding of various metals. In this approach, the initial prochelator compound forms an active metal-binding chelator under specific conditions in order to minimize indiscriminate depletion of essential metal ions and potential side effects. The tetrazolium prochelators are stable in blood serum and present antiproliferative activities at micromolar concentrations, as confirmed against a panel of various cancer cell lines. Multiple cell-based assays demonstrate that the compounds impact intracellular iron signaling and that the toxicity is associated, at least in part, to iron sequestration. Iron is an essential element and is the most abundant transition metal in humans. The normal functions of human cells rely on iron due to its vital role in oxygen transport, energy generation, and DNA synthesis. Altered metabolism and homeostasis of transition metal ions (such as iron, copper, and zinc) are associated with several pathological conditions including cancer and neurodegeneration. Thus, metal-binding compounds (chelators) that affect metal availability in disease conditions may be potential drug candidates. Malignant cells have a higher demand for iron to sustain their rapid proliferation rates. As a result, targeting iron metabolism in cancer cells has become a promising strategy in cancer therapy. Iron chelation therapy is a treatment that removes iron in the organism by utilizing a small-molecule scavenger. This invention uses tetrazolium salts as prochelators, namely precursors to iron chelators that can limit intracellular iron availability and cause cell death. The invention relates to methods of making the tetrazolium salts and methods of treatment using the compounds.",

This technology serves as a non-toxic alternative to the current method of rutin dissolution, with no physiological or cognitive side effects on the honeybees themselves. Notably, this method offers a promising approach for enhancing the bioavailability of rutin, thus potentially amplifying its therapeutic and protective benefits.\n\nFlavonoids are nutraceutical molecules derived from plants and studied for more than a century in diverse contexts, from cell culture to clinical trials. However, constraints in flavonoid solubility in water have been a challenge for research and administration. As the main alternative, Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) is used to dissolve flavonoids as well as other polar and nonpolar molecules. DMSO has been widely recognized for its presumed non-toxicity and is approved for tests in toxicology. However, recent evidence suggests that DMSO may be toxic even at low concentrations, questioning its reliability in bioassays. This evidence purports the need for an alternative for flavonoid dissolution.\n\nApplications:\n* Honeybee research\n* Flavonoid dissolution\n* Agriculture research/practices\n* General biomedical research\n\nAdvantages:\n* Non-toxic alternative to traditional methods\n* Provides cognitive protection for honeybees",

GeoKBA extends this model, employing \u201csomething you know\u201d and \u201csomething you do\u201d by simultaneously testing users on two factors relative to their familiarity with specific geographic locations (i.e., geo-targets), assessing responses in terms of objective accuracy as well as behavioral patterns exhibited while providing those responses. The GeoKBA approach greatly increases accuracy and security over single factor approaches and presents and collects these dual factors in a single process for a better user experience. Unlike existing KBA methods, the GeoKBA approach will work with first touch users (e.g., account opening) or repeat users (e.g., password reset). The evolving landscape of cyber threats necessitates innovations like GeoKBA, which not only act as an additional protective layer but also anticipate and counter newer hacking methods by rooting identity verification in the real-world attribute of geographical location. The alarming rate of hacking incidents and the sophisticated techniques employed by cybercriminals underscore the pressing need for reinforced identity verification methods to protect internet users as they exchange and store sensitive personal information and financial data.

    "ip_description": "The technology is a method to recycle water that is used during dialysis. By using activated charcoal, urease, zirconium oxide and zirconium phosphate to filter the water of contaminants, this method can make water achieve a purity level that is acceptable for clinical reuse. As dialysis becomes an essential treatment for an increasing number of patients globally, the need for water conservation in the process is paramount. By allowing water to be recycled for clinical reuse, this technology not only contributes to environmental sustainability but also ensures a steady supply of purified water for uninterrupted dialysis sessions. Dialysis is a method used to eliminate waste substances and surplus fluids from the bloodstream in situations where the kidneys are not functioning adequately. Typically, this process entails redirecting the blood to a specialized machine for thorough purification (NHS). Current systems use a hollow fiber kidney system to exchange fluid, electrolytes, and waste with dialysate. However, these systems are non-portable, requiring access to a large water and dialysate source in a hospital or clinic setting. The new technology aims to fix that by recapturing dialysate and water, so that it can be reused. While traditional dialysis procedures are effective in their purpose, the consumption of water in large quantities remains a concern. Modern medical advancements necessitate the development of more sustainable methods, ensuring both the well-being of patients and a reduced ecological footprint. The introduction of technologies that promote the efficient use of resources in medical treatments is a step forward in achieving a balance between healthcare and environmental conservation.

With this invention, early detection and diagnosis of cervical malignancy can become more widespread, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and a reduction in healthcare disparities. Timely, accurate diagnosis and treatment of cervical precancer remains a significant healthcare challenge in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). More than 80% of the 570,000 annual cervical cancer cases and 311,000 annual cervical cancer-related deaths occur in LMICs, due to the lack of resources for conducting organized screening and treatment services. In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for immediate action to end cervical cancer with a plan emphasizing the importance of screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing of self-collected samples is gaining traction as the first line screening method for cervical malignancy in LMICs. While HPV testing provides a sensitive and quantitative biomarker, a significant portion of the women with a positive HPV test will clear the HPV infection and never develop malignant diseases, which leads to overtreatment that causes an increased burden on the health care system, unnecessary adverse effects (pain, bleeding, discharge, and psychological distress), and an increased risk of adverse obstetric outcomes. Those that do develop disease also undergo additional tests that are often invasive and may not yield accurate results.

This technology aims to enable the creation of a sophisticated activation energy predictor / modeler that will enable the investigation and development of chemical reactions through an optimized catalyst. Utilizing machine learning, this technology seeks to revolutionize the catalyst design process by drawing from vast datasets to make more informed decisions. This holistic approach ensures that researchers can hone in on the most effective catalysts without the intensive time investments traditionally required. Current methods require sophisticated teams working iteratively with best guesses to develop an optimized reaction. This technology aims to significantly improve the workflow for these teams by many magnitudes. Improving the number of options being analyzed and solving more problems and applications. While previously the identification of more efficient catalysts relied on the intuition of researchers in selecting and evaluating a small number of new compounds for a given reaction. However, today large search spaces can be screened using descriptor-based approaches obtained from computational work alone. With the integration of machine learning, the reliance on human intuition diminishes, paving the way for more systematic and data-driven evaluations. This shift not only accelerates the research process but also eliminates potential human biases, ensuring that the most viable catalyst options are consistently brought to the forefront.

The improvement consists of using high speed jets to create a supersonic jet curtain to provide flight directional controls. The jets are installed in the wings and are able to control the pitch, yaw, and roll of a tailless aircraft. A tailless aircraft is a type of aircraft that does not have any horizontal aerodynamic surface other than its main wing. This type of aircraft may still have a fuselage, a vertical tail fin, and/or a vertical rudder. The aerodynamic control and stabilization functions in both pitch and roll are incorporated into the main wing. As aircraft designs advanced with higher cruise speeds and swept-back wings or tailless configurations, Active Flow Control (AFC) shifted its focus to stability and control. Tailless aircraft lacked the necessary leverage for controlling rotational axes, posing challenges, particularly in stealthy blended-wing-body designs without vertical stabilizers and deflectable control surfaces. Applications include aircraft parameter control, tailless wing aircrafts, and blended wing aircraft. Advantages include the ability to be used in stealth aircraft applications and to most aircraft, and the capability to provide pitch, yaw, and roll controls.",

Compared to conventional elastic waves, topologically protected waves provide a significant benefit for reducing the return loss in devices. Superlattices supporting topologically protected acoustic waves provide attractive and disruptive solutions for designing the next generation of low-loss acoustic wave devices for telecommunication or sensing. Such superlattices are technologically compatible with existing acoustic wave devices. It is observed that the introduction of topological approaches might allow devices to tackle challenges related to maintaining performance in diverse environments. The potential for this innovation to influence standards of efficiency and compatibility in the acoustic device realm is worth noting. Previously, the literature has proposed to use topologically protected acoustic waves to reduce the loss of acoustic wave devices such as radio frequency devices. However, these approaches rely on topological wave supporting media which are either difficult to realize physically or lack compatibility with the manufacturing process of existing acoustic wave devices. The inventors demonstrate that finite superlattices in a prototypical device offer the benefits of topological protection in reducing the return/insertion loss of acoustic wave devices. Historically, the integration of topologically protected waves in acoustic devices presented significant challenges. The consideration of finite superlattices in this context introduces a novel perspective that might be pivotal for future research and developments.

The inventors also introduce a new classical algorithm based on graph spectra that outperforms other classical algorithms and demonstrate that, on reasonable assumptions of loss and squeezing parameters, this quantum algorithm performs better than classical algorithms. Furthermore, the innovative approach of combining classical and quantum methods presents new possibilities for tackling complex computational problems in graph theory. This hybrid quantum-classical algorithm solves the well-known NP-complete problem of determining if two given graphs are a vertex minor of one another. The inventors found a way to map a graph into GBS that allows trading between the one-shot classification accuracy and the amount of squeezing needed at the input, a hard-to-produce quantum-optical resource. This mapping to GBS not only optimizes the computational resources but also opens doors for new research avenues in quantum computing and graph theory. Classification of vertex-minor graphs has been primarily tackled using traditional classical algorithms, which often prove inefficient and time-consuming for large and complex graph structures.

This peptide functions as an antagonist or inhibitor, binding to the intracellular portion of APN. The primary focus of this technology is to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and viral infections, including COVID-19. PAH is a severe cardiovascular disease characterized by thickening of the pulmonary arteries due to uncontrolled proliferation of smooth muscle cells, leading to right ventricular hypertrophy and failure. The technology aims to target the causal protein, APN, which plays a major role in the pathological mechanisms of PAH triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction (MD). The research team has identified a specific domain of APN in the cytosolic region that has significant pathological implications. Initial results in preclinical studies with the APN blocking peptide have shown promising outcomes, effectively controlling APN signaling without affecting its essential peptidase domain, thus offering a novel and efficient strategy for treating PAH. Current treatment options for pulmonary arterial hypertension focus on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression, but they often have limited efficacy and manage symptoms without addressing the underlying pathological mechanisms. There is a critical need for a targeted therapy that can intervene at the early stages of this deadly cardiovascular disease to reverse vascular remodeling and mitigate disease progression. In contrast, this novel peptide technology specifically targets a protein implicated in the pathology of PAH, particularly in cases induced by mitochondrial dysfunction (MD).

    "ip_description": "This invention provides compositions and method of pain treatment using a mu/delta opioid receptor heterodimer (MDOR) antagonist which has improved druggability by nanoformulation and/or glycosylation to increase their bioavailability and efficacy. These modified antagonists and formulations provide for enhancement of opioid agonist therapy's antinociceptive effects, reduction of side effects or adverse effects of opioid agonist therapy, and reduced withdrawal symptoms. Proof-of-concept testing in animals has shown a significant increase in oxymorphone antinociception. Opioids continue to be widely used for pain treatment. However, constant opioid treatment is accompanied with serious undesirable effects including drowsiness and mental clouding, nausea and emesis, constipation and in many cases dependence and addiction. Continuous use of opioid therapy also develops analgesic tolerance and hyperalgesia in many patients. These unwanted effects significantly diminish the patients\u2019 quality of life. The mechanisms for these side effects are still largely unclear. However, one particular side effect, namely addiction, is a cause for great concern in pain treatment using opioids. Prescription opioids can be highly addictive and are widely misused. It has been estimated that the total economic cost of opioid misuse in the United States is $78.5 billion per year. The opioid crisis has been exacerbated by over-prescription of opioid pain-relievers for the treatment of pain. Due at least in part to over-prescription and additive nature of opioids, some who experience chronic pain may suffer undertreatment. In fact, in many parts of the developing world, access to opioids even for acute pain and/or cancer pain can be restricted due to concerns over addiction and overdose. Even in the United States, some patients can suffer from an undertreatment of pain. For example, patients with cognitive impairment and the elderly can be especially susceptible to the central nervous system effects of traditional opioids such as morphine and in some cases are not prescribed enough to meet their pain management needs. Receptors do not only signal as single units, but can bind to each other to form dimers and oligomers that signal differently from single receptors. In earlier work, the inventors developed a selective antagonist compound for the mu/delta opioid receptor heterodimer (MDOR), and used this ligand to show that the MDOR acted as an opioid negative feedback loop, suppressing pain relief and enhancing side effects. Reversing this effect by treatment with this approach thus has promise in improving opioid pain relief and reducing side effects like withdrawal. However, the compound studied previously is a flexible peptide with poor metabolic stability and blood-brain barrier penetration. The inventors thus sought to improve druggability by developing analogues and formulation.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of Arizona investigated the antimicrobial properties of Phenyllactic Acid (PLA) derivatives against both commensal and Bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated bacteria, as well as their cytotoxic effects on human cervical epithelial cells. PLA is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound produced by vaginal Lactobacillus species; however, its mechanisms and functions within the cervicovaginal microenvironment are not well understood. To address the solubility issue of PLA, the researchers synthesized PLA ionic liquids (ILs) using choline and carnitine counterions, which allowed for the solubilization of D- and L-enantiomers of PLA in water. Various assays were conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the PLA ILs against different bacterial species, and it was found that antimicrobial activity varied depending on the stereochemistry of PLA and the counterion present in the ILs, but was effective overall. Overall, this study highlights the potential of PLA and its derivatives as antimicrobial agents against bacterial vaginosis. The stereochemistry of PLA and the choice of counterion in the ILs play a significant role in their antimicrobial activity, while the counterion affects the cytotoxicity to human cervical cells. Further investigations are underway to determine optimal inhibitory concentrations and explore additional formulations of PLA for potential therapeutic applications in the cervicovaginal microenvironment, which could lead to the development of more effective, targeted treatments for BV. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a condition characterized by lactobacilli depletion and overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria in the vagina and cervix, which can lead to various adverse gynecologic and obstetric outcomes. Current technologies for treating BV, such as antibiotics, often have limitations and may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance.

A PROTAC is a heterobifunctional molecule composed of two active domains and a linker, capable of removing specific unwanted proteins. This technology opens the door for the treatment of diseases and conditions otherwise thought to be untreatable or undruggable. Once a target protein is identified as being associated with a disease, traditional drug discovery strategies have centered around finding an inhibitor to that protein. In many cases, such an approach involves screening a library of small-molecule drug candidates to identify those that bind to an active site on the target protein and modulate its activity. This traditional approach has certain limitations, which PROTACs can overcome.

Compared to current tunable light sources, this system offers high power and a wide spectrum. Furthermore, the polarization state of each spectrum can be adjusted as needed without the requirement of an additional spatial light modulator. Tunable light sources are an emerging technology that have gained importance in a range of industries, including biomedicine, materials science, and semiconductors, among others. The ability to tune the wavelength or spectrum of light has become crucial for various applications, including fluorescence microscopy, spectroscopy, and photolithography. Traditional light sources such as incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps are typically fixed in their spectral output, which limits their usefulness in many scientific and industrial applications. To address this limitation, tunable light sources have been developed that offer greater flexibility and precision in spectral output. One approach to creating tunable light sources involves using a spatial light modulator (SLM), which allows for adjusting the amplitude, phase, and polarization of light. SLMs are typically composed of an array of small pixels that can be electronically controlled to manipulate the light passing through them. By programming the SLM, one can generate a desired spectrum or wavelength of light. The innovation is one example of a tunable light source that uses a single SLM to provide a wide range of spectral output and polarization states. By doing so, the system\u2019s costs and complexity are reduced while its efficiency and versatility are increased.

A waveguide is used to relay the pupil of the wide field of view imaging system to the axis of the objective. The system addresses limitations of state-of-the-art microscope objectives and is particularly useful for biomedical and cancer imaging. Optical microscopy is a key tool in biomedical and cancer imaging because it offers several ideal features for imaging cells and tissue structure. For example, (1) the resolution is well-matched to the sizes of subcellular structures, (2) a diverse range of available fluorescent probes makes it possible to mark proteins, organelles, and other structures for imaging, (3) the relatively nonperturbing nature of light means that living cells can be imaged for long periods of time to follow their dynamics, (4) it offers a wide spectral range that enables various imaging modalities to investigate cellular processes and/or structural, molecular, and chemical characteristics, (5) and it is an essential tool in clinical cancer imaging. For clinical and research microscopy, the objective is the most important component since it determines the resolution and throughput. While there are significant efforts in developing new objectives for various applications, the state-of-the-art microscope objectives still have some major limitations. One limitation of the current state-of-the-art microscope objectives is that they are designed without consideration of integrating low-resolution, wide-FOV imaging capability.

A \u201cphi-bit,\u201d is a two-state degree of freedom of an acoustic wave (an acoustic spin), which can be in a coherent superposition of states with complex amplitude coefficients. Phi-bits are therefore analogues of qubits. The inventors have developed a simple model of the nonlinear array of externally driven coupled acoustic waveguides to shed light on possible mechanisms for the experimentally observed behavior of the logical phi-bit phase. Lastly, the inventors illustrate the ability to experimentally initialize the state of single and multiple phi-bit systems by exploiting the drivers\u2019 phase as a tuning parameter. It is also shown that nonlinear correlation between phi-bits enables parallelism in the manipulation of two and multi phi-bit superpositions of states. Quantum computing is a growing field due to the potential for quantum computers to solve complex computations substantially faster than a regular computer. The field is also increasingly relevant as it shifts towards real world use due to applications in the pharmaceutical industry and around data security, among other uses. A major hurdle in the use of quantum computing is the expensive requirements of use. Along with physical obstacles such as the high temperature quantum computers run at, they are often not scalable due to physical limitations which do not allow for an increase of qubits. However, with the recent advancements in phi-bits, a new pathway towards scalable quantum computing has been illuminated. The phi-bits, as analogues of qubits, possess the potential to overcome the current limitations faced by conventional quantum computing, thereby promising a more accessible and efficient way of performing complex computations.

Researchers plan to develop cell lines transduced with lentivirus vectors that can be cocultured and the process of trogocytosis will result in cell fusion that will generate a luminescent signal. Selected small molecules with demonstrated inhibition will undergo further studies to validate their functional properties and optimize their structure. The ultimate objective is to develop a drug that can be administered directly into the tumor site through injection or other systemic means to effectively hinder tumor development. Trogocytosis occurs when a very early-stage epithelial cell interacts with an endogenous lymphocyte in a transient manner such that membranes and protein molecules are exchanged. Later, they become stable fused cells in which the proteins are expressed in a stable form. Trogocytosis has been identified as a key factor in the formation of solid tumors, particularly renal clear cell tumors.

It can also be used as a method of automating 3D additive manufacturing of heterogeneous nanostructured materials and devices. The previous invention used optical tweezers to position micro and nanoscale building blocks that were linked together using biochemical linker molecules to assemble nanophotonic metamaterials and devices. OPAL offered the potential for particularly high resolution and multi-material integration compared to other existing 3D nanofabrication tools. Previously, OPAL was semi-automated in that while the positioning of the building blocks was automated via computer control, the loading of particles into the optical trap was not. It was done by the operator manually \u201cfishing\u201d for particles using the optical tweezer. The current invention is a method of fully automating the approach using the back-scattered optical signal to ensure that a single particle of the desired size is trapped. More specifically, the signal will be used to determine whether zero, one, or more particles of a given size are in the trap. The computer will then act accordingly to ensure the right particle is brought to the right location.",

Specifically, the technology targets the Default Mode Network (DMN) through Continuous Theta Burst stimulation, which has been shown to reduce neural activity in the part of the brain responsible for daydreaming and rumination, ultimately leading to a reduction in sleep onset time.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 30-35% of adults have brief symptoms of insomnia, 15-20% have short-term insomnia disorder, which lasts less than three months, and 10% have a chronic insomnia disorder, which occurs at least three times per week for at least three months. Chronic insomnia can have a negative impact on health, increasing the risk of depression and high blood pressure, and manifests as fatigue, poor memory, inability to concentrate, mood disturbance, and/or increased errors or accidents. Current treatments for insomnia include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and prescription sleeping pills.\n\nChronic insomnia is a disorder associated with increased cognitive arousal. Insomnia is also associated with activation/connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) of the brain, consistent with the hyperarousal theory. Using transcranial stimulation toward the DMN is an effective and non-invasive method to address insomnia and sleep problems without the need for drugs or other chemicals.\n\nApplications:\n*   Transcranial stimulation\n*   Treatment for insomnia\n*   Sleep improvement\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Non-pharmacological\n*   Non-invasive\n*   Precise\n*   Long-lasting",

The second type of ILs consists of biocompatible and pharmaceutically acceptable cations and anions are used as a solvent to solubilize and deliver drugs with poor solubility and/or permeability. The third type of ILs consist of biocompatible cation and anion that, when added to water at a specific concentration, can form self-assembled nanostructures, which can package a variety of hydrophobic therapeutic agents. Low-solubility and/or low permeability impact the delivery, bioavailability, and efficacy of therapeutic agents that are already approved or in the process of drug development. These reasons impact the delivery, bioavailability and efficacy of these therapeutic agents. Thus, ILs have emerged as the next-generation vehicle for drug delivery. Ionic liquids can be used as a solubility enhancer, permeability enhancer, stabilizer, targeted delivery inducer, stealth property provider or bioavailability enhancer.

The invention will use a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow sensor, a way to determine the position of the patient and the collection vessel, and an actuator that can automatically adjust the position of the collection vessel to compensate for any motion of the patient to help maintain the patient\u2019s intercranial pressure. This can also determine the actual flow of CSF and adjust the height of the collection vessel so that over-drainage does not occur.\n\nExternal ventricular drain (EVD) systems are used to treat brain trauma, stroke, inflammation, and other conditions associated with the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid and blood in the brain. A typical EVD system contains a catheter inserted in the brain ventricle, tubing with a 3-way sampling port, a check valve preventing back-flow, and a collection vessel placed at a pre-determined height to ensure a constant value of intracranial pressure. One of the drawbacks of such systems is that frequent monitoring of the equipment is needed to ensure that the vessel is in a correct position.\n\nAnother issue of current EVD systems is related to the intercranial pressure. The pressure configuration of an EVD system is patient and disease specific, so it is critical to have a good value for each case. A high pressure might be less effective in treating the patient\u2019s condition, while a low pressure could result in over-draining, with a risk of collapse of ventricles and associated irreversible damage.\n\nApplications:\n*   Collection and management of cerebrospinal fluid related to\n    *   Brain trauma\n    *   Stroke\n    *   Inflammation\n    *   Other conditions associated with accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid and blood in the brain\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Can automatically change the position of the collection vessel\n*   Can determine the flow of cerebrospinal fluid\n*   Can adjust the height of the vessel so that over-drainage cannot occur\n*   Less monitoring needed from nursing staff",

The neural-field technique has a small graphic processing memory (GPU memory) footprint, which allows it to be applied in three-dimensional or higher-dimensional CT imaging. The proposed technique is self-supervised and trained instance-wisely, eliminating data labeling or any training of datasets. This algorithm can also produce synthesized projections that can be combined with existing projections to yield denser or complete projection data to be used by other image-reconstruction methods. Each year there are more than 70 million CT scans performed in the U.S., with that number increasing annually at a rate of 10%. Despite several image-reconstruction algorithms for CTs existing, there is a lack of commercial products utilizing those techniques. This invention has the potential to change the standardized products by enabling faster imaging which, in turn, allows for more efficient diagnoses. The technology can be commercialized to enhance and improve cone-beam CT image reconstruction, which translates to a further reduction of radiation doses. Radiation from CT scans may cause damage to the DNA in one\u2019s cells and thus increase their chances of these cells developing into cancer. Reducing radiation doses lowers the chances of negative effects from these scans. In addition to this, the per-data self-supervision component of the technique opens the door to its wide adoption across different imaging geometries, protocols, or scanners.

This differentiates the temperatures of each chamber to house different stages of thermochemical reactions for hydrogen production. Using solar energy to produce hydrogen for fuel is a solution for long-term solar energy storage. The problem with current technologies for producing hydrogen fuel is that they are not sustainable, efficient, or cost-effective. Traditional hydrogen production methods, such as steam reforming and partial oxidation, rely on fossil fuels, which are finite and produce greenhouse gases during the production process.

This technology addresses these issues by using solar energy to produce hydrogen. By utilizing the different temperatures of each chamber in the tower, the technology is able to produce hydrogen more efficiently and at a lower cost compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the use of solar energy makes the process sustainable and reduces the production of greenhouse gases. Applications include hydrogen production and long-term solar energy storage. Advantages include utilizing renewable and sustainable source of energy (solar), decreasing reliance on finite fossil fuels for hydrogen production, reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional hydrogen production methods, increasing efficiency and lowering costs compared to traditional hydrogen production methods, offering a solution for long-term solar energy storage, and increasing the feasibility and viability of using hydrogen as a fuel source.",

Targeting the underlying TLE pathophysiology in a personalized, therapeutic manner, based on leukocyte gene expression, represents a new medical decision-making paradigm, amenable to pharmacologic treatment and surgical therapy. The dichotomized approach will more appropriately target therapy to the genetic and biological pathway TLE abnormalities amenable to treatment intervention.\n\nHigh and low seizure frequency categories of intractable TLE represent two mechanistically different disease states, based on leukocyte gene expression. These newly identified leukocyte gene biomarkers, for high and low seizure frequency, may direct medical management of TLE by identifying those biological pathways and genes which are involved in the pathophysiology of individual categories of TLE, high and low seizure frequency. These newly identified leukocyte gene and biological pathway biomarkers could direct personalized medical management of intractable TLE with anti-seizure medication targeting the specific gene and biologic pathways, which are unique to high and low seizure frequency categories of disease. In addition, these newly identified leukocyte gene and biological pathway biomarkers could direct personalized surgical intervention, including vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, responsive neurostimulation and emerging techniques of stem cell and gene therapy in temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nCurrently, medical management of intractable TLE is based on the clinical diagnosis of intractable TLE. A more tailored approach for TLE treatment, based on mechanistically separate categories of disease of high and low seizure frequency, will allow more personalized pharmacologic therapy directed at TLE genomic and biological pathway-specific pathophysiology for the high and low seizure frequency categories of disease.

CN counters are widely available, but counters that can detect particles at ultrafine particle sizes (<0.1 microns) are very expensive (tens of thousands of dollars). This invention could make the detection of these very small particles achievable at greater than one to two orders of magnitude lower than is currently possible. Ultrafine particles are critically important for human health because they penetrate deep into the lungs. They are ubiquitous in urban air, are produced in the home (i.e., following nucleation through condensation of cleaning products; or through the production of soot from gas ranges), and have a wide variety of industrial sources. An inexpensive detector that can detect, count, and record properties of particles from the ultrafine size mode, as well as in much larger size modes, could provide transformative benefits to several industries and applications. Applications: Detecting, counting, and recording properties of ultrafine particles, Analyzing health, environmental, and manufacturing air conditions. Advantages: Compact, Inexpensive.",

The construct created by this method results with no foreign sequences, making the strains markerless mutants. This means that one has the potential to make genetic strains with multiple mutations and can therefore contribute to nearly every area of biological research. Deletion of the Coccidioides CPS1 gene resulted in a mutant strain that shows efficacy and safety as a live attenuated vaccine to prevent coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) that is being developed for commercial production as a canine vaccine. The markerless cps1 deletion mutant may be critical for getting regulatory approval of a live attenuated cps1 vaccine for humans. Ultimately, one wishes to determine how genes\u2014and the proteins they encode\u2014function in the intact organism. Although it may sound counterintuitive, one of the most direct ways to find out what a gene does is to see what happens to the organism when that gene is missing. Studying mutant organisms that have acquired changes or deletions in their nucleotide sequences is a time-honored practice in biology. Because mutations can interrupt cellular processes, mutants often hold the key to understanding gene function. In the classical approach to the important field of genetics, one begins by isolating mutants that have an interesting or unusual appearance: fruit flies with white eyes or curly wings, for example. While methods of producing these mutations have become more sophisticated as time has progressed, the need to modernize biological techniques has never been greater.",

This invention also includes a novel beam splitter device that splits an incoming light beam into multiple beams and different directions. The beam splitter device also operates as a beam combiner and optical interconnect. The key attribute here is that the device can be used for high-energy electromagnetic applications, such as X-ray, gamma ray, particle beam, and other hyperspectral applications, with very low loss. A beam splitter is an optical device that splits a beam into multiple beams and is an essential component of many optical instruments. Conventional beam splitter operates either by the principle of division of amplitude or division of wave front. This invention describes a novel type of beam splitter that operates by the principle of division of time. Such a device has a unique advantage because the incoming beam is split by reflection only, instead of by transmission and reflection. Thus, the invention can be applied not only to visible light, but also to x-ray, gamma ray and particles, where transmission loss can be large. Applications include high-energy electromagnetic applications (X-ray, Gamma ray, Particle beam) and hyperspectral applications.

This makes it ideal for many uses, including biomedical applications.

Such a soft robotic agent would have the ability to maneuver in tight spaces, would be immune to high pressures, low temperatures, and extreme pH values, would be nearly noiseless, and would not create a meaningful heat signature when deployed in an operational environment. This makes it ideal for many uses, including underwater/deep sea exploration, extraterrestrial ocean world exploration, and military use.

The projected patterns can be modified in real-time to improve sampling of local areas where there are large changes and high background noise. Structured light illumination is used extensively in 3D imaging to measure topography of an object. Conventional methods utilize periodic fringe pattern of different phase to reconstruct the surface shape of an object. Different periodic fringes are projected onto the object sequentially and the reflected fringes are measured at different times. A minimum of three sets of fringes are needed for reconstruction and more fringes are often used to improve accuracy. When the different fringes are projected at the same time, the camera cannot identify and separate the different fringes. The measurement technique is limited by the time to project and to measure accurately the different fringe patterns and cannot be applied to rapidly changing or moving objects.",

The flap will not interfere with the delivery of the infant as it is located inferior to the vaginal introitus. This will create a sealed barrier between the sterile field and any defecation so that the infant will not encounter fecal matter. Providers can then focus on supporting the patient through the pushing process instead of wiping up fecal matter and disposing of it to reestablish a sterile area. If necessary, the flap can be easily removed to expose the anus. Bowel movements are common during the second stage of labor due to the muscles utilized during pushing the infant down the birth canal. The embarrassment from the bowel movements often distracts or causes added stress for the patient during childbirth. The nurses and providers also are continuously using and disposing of resources to clean the patient in order to alleviate stress and maintain a sterile environment for the infant. It is standard for a sterile under-buttocks drape to be present during childbirth. However, it only addresses the collection of blood and other fluids expelled during vaginal delivery.

Instead of using binary encoding methods such as frequency resolved optical gating and on-off keying, this invention encodes vital information into the polarization state of the light pulse. This new approach decreases measurement error by generating a key code that uniquely identifies a transmitter and receiver pair. The invention also leverages the diattenuation and retardance of birefringent objects to modify the polarization state of the reflected light pulse. To distinguish these changes, the transmitted light pulse can be duplicated or sent in triplicate pairs, and the modifications in the polarization state can be detected by the receiver. Conventional LiDAR devices rely on the reflectance of the object, and objects with high absorption and light scattering tend to reflect less light back to the receiver. This innovative approach improves on this limitation by considering the diattenuation and retardance of birefringent objects, which can alter the polarization state of the light pulse. By using polarized light and encoding key information into the polarization state of the light pulse, the signal to noise ratio can be improved, and crosstalk can be minimized.",

The phase-based camera, coupled with existing cameras and sensors normally equipped on autonomous vehicles, allows for detection and viewing objects through fog, smoke, or other atmospheric obstructions. The system consists of a lens, phase light modulation (PLM) device, 2-dimension detector array such as complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) imager and a light source, such as a collimated laser, which illuminates the object. Return signal from an object\u2014for example, a car in fog\u2014is captured by camera with a PLM which is situated in the optical path between the camera lens and 2-dimentional detector array. In the system, two or more images are captured by camera while displaying phase and/or amplitude profiles which are orthogonal with each other. The images are subtracted to eliminate background and deconvolved to enhance the feature inside the fog or other disruptive media. Camera-based object recognition and autonomous driving based on the information is one of the critical functions for Advanced Driver Assistant System (ADAS) for automotives. Camera-based ADAS is not only applicable for ground-based mobility, but also for mobility in air.

All such mobility infrastructures rely upon situational awareness by camera, and other means such as radar and LIDAR. One of the common challenges in situation awareness for urban mobility as an infrastructure is robustness to inclement weather conditions, such as fog, rain, and snow. The camera-based situation awareness does not work well in such conditions. In contrast, the radar can see through fog since the wavelength is much longer compared to the length scale of fog and rainwater particles. However, known challenges include resolution and signal contrast. This technology offers radar-like capability with the resolution of an optical camera.",

The camera can create a synthetic hologram by combining light at two closely spaced optical frequencies to produce a low-frequency synthetic wave (beat wave), largely immune to the unknown scattering processes between the hidden scene and detector. This is primarily proposed for medical imaging applications through living tissue. This noninvasive technique only uses light in the optical wave band and works with standard off-the-shelf camera technology\u2013 potentially even with mobile phone camera sensors, leveraging the huge potential of carefully designed optical systems paired with sophisticated algorithms.\n\nThe plan to develop such a camera needs a Synthetic Wavelength Holography (SWH) to image through scattering media and around corners with a demonstrated resolution of up to 800\u03bcm. However, the current SWH approach relies on the acquisition of sequentially captured images and is extremely susceptible to motion, making imaging through living tissue impossible with the current method. The current SWH technique also relies on expensive modulation/imaging hardware. The plan found its solution from the spatial heterodyning procedure, which allows for single-shot SWH measurements with the same or similar quality. This means that all required information can be captured with one single camera image in a very short exposure time. Moreover, this approach only requires the standard off-the-shelf camera technology that can be found in every smartphone instead of expensive modulation/imaging hardware. If successful, the camera could become part of a new wave of computational imaging devices that will represent key technologies in the near future.",

    "ip_description": "This invention relates to the intellectual property that consists of a stored archive of hundreds of mouse blood plasma samples that were taken from a laboratory stroke model for mice under various conditions of the mice age and the time past stroke. By evaluating the quantity of neurofilament light (NfL) chain (protein) within the samples they can serve as an indication of neurological damage. These indicators can then be used to develop correlations and calibrations to other measurements or assay methods of neurological damage post-stroke. Neurofilament Light chain (NfL) is a neuronal protein released from cells which have sustained damage in neurological disorders, one of which is stroke. After studying stroke in a laboratory mouse model, the inventors have collected and archived hundreds of plasma samples from mouse blood under various conditions. Once these samples have been obtained, they may be used to determine whether an assay that quantify these NfL levels in human plasma may also be used to detect NfL in mouse plasma. When comparing the NfL levels in mice, there is the possibility of this assay detecting age-related neurodegeneration as well as validating the kit that can detect stroke-related neurodegeneration. Applications include a novel immunoassay for stroke detection and a novel immunoassay for neurodegenerative diseases. Advantages include being a diagnostic tool for strokes and other neurodegenerative diseases and can be used as a predictive biomarker for strokes.",

A bell flower-like geometry is used for its ability to capture an incoming vehicle with randomized conditions and trajectories due to running out of fuel or damage to propulsion or guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems. Inflatable systems have widespread applications in the aerospace and astronautics industries as habitats, atmospheric decelerators, debris capture systems, and methods of satellite dispersion from a mothership. Using inflatables for the purpose of capturing or retrieving swarms of air/spacecraft is an innovative implementation of available technology which has the capability to outperform many of the current methods like tethers and solid docking stations. The markets for CubeSats, microsatellites, deep space exploration, space robotics, drones, and swarm intelligence are forecasted to see moderate to high levels of growth in the 2020s. Given the proximity of this innovation to these markets, stable short-term demand can be expected. There is currently no mainstream industry standard for retrieving swarms of air/spacecraft to a mothership, so the competition may be fierce, but end-users are limited in their options.",

    "ip_description": "This invention provides methods of treating one or more eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and related clinical syndromes. A new treatment strategy has been discovered, which inhibits two different neural circuits, which rescues all three of the activity-based anorexia (ABA) animal model phenotypes of extreme increases in wheel activity, decreases in food intake, and consequently, life-threatening loss in body weight. Methods of administration for a therapeutic may include electric brain stimulation and/or pharmacological inhibitors of specific protein expression. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a prevalent eating disorder seen primarily in females, which significantly disrupts life and health, to the point of reaching fatality in extreme cases, with the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. AN is characterized by self-starvation, fear of gaining weight, and excessive exercise, but also is often co-diagnosed with other psychiatric and emotional disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder. These characteristics of AN suggest the neural circuits regulating eating behavior and the neural circuits regulating emotion interact extensively and significantly to control AN development. However, studies of single neural pathways show that the underlying neural mechanisms involved in AN, particularly how neurons in the amygdala regulate the development remain to be determined. There remains an urgent need for an effective intervention strategy in treating eating disorders. Applications: Treatments for anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and related syndromes; Biological target for drug discovery. Advantages: Specific biological targeting of neuronal pathways regulating eating disorders; Opportunity for direct device and/or pharmacological intervention; Attractive results from animal tests.",

    "ip_description": "The technology is a new method of sequential control of electromagnets in the application of autonomous docking using two CubeSat (miniature satellites). This is done with the help of active illumination signals through LED lights that are installed on two different CubeSats which helps for target identification in both CubeSats. Once the target identification process is done, the runner CubeSat and the chaser CubeSat start to move closer to each other with their propulsion. After the two CubeSats are close enough to each other the lights turn off and a two-step process starts to dock the two CubeSats. The first step is to deploy of an inflated balloon structure, and the second step involves turning the electromagnets. Autonomous docking is an important part of spacecraft innovation. It makes possible for spacecrafts to link together, which can allow for in-space assembly and on-orbit servicing. Current docking spacecraft docking methods are more prone to cause collisions and subsequent failures during the rendezvous and proximity operations. The invention proposes using electromagnetic levitations as it has been proved to be one of the safest approaches for autonomous docking. The main goal of the technology is to have two spacecrafts to dock with each other using the electromagnetic levitation method by using the onboard systems which will also enable a minimal use of active thrusters and fuel. Applications include autonomous docking for spacecrafts, formation flying, surveillance, security, and fault detection for smaller non-contact docking. Advantages include more freedom of error in the docking error, reduced change of leakage problems, and a safer approach for docking spacecrafts.",

This mode of action alters EGFR-dependent gene transcription, induces the loss of cancer cell survival and migratory capacity, and induces tumor regression. This therapeutic induces cell death in wildtype EGFR-expressing cancer cells, but not normal epithelium. Efficacy experiments in a mouse model for EGFR-dependent breast cancer resulted in significant tumor regression without observable toxicity. In addition, this compound activates the immune system, exhibited by cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells activity in the immune microenvironment, and a prognostically favorable macrophage M1/M2 ratio. Target disease indications are breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, as well as other cancer types in which EGFR is implicated. Toxicology tests in a mouse model show favorable results. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has long been in need of therapies that are both effective and targeted. Current drugs for TNBC such as monoclonal antibodies and PARP inhibitors have limited effectiveness and serious side effects such as nausea, fatigue, decreased white blood cell count, anemia, and upper respiratory tract infection. This invention holds the promise to make treatment of TNBC possible for more people and more effective via its unique mechanism of action, while also reducing side effects by superior targeting of the disease.

    "published_date": "7/5/2023",
    "ip_description": "This technology is a method for measuring heliostats for solar energy applications, as well as any large optical surface composed of second-surface mirrors. A small diffraction grating, which is a 1D, 2D, or 3D periodic phase and/or amplitude modulation, is embedded within the glass substrate of a second-surface mirror. Light from a metrology system propagates through this grating before and after reflection, allowing it to be directed to non-specular directions to be measured by the optical system. Multiple gratings can be written in a single layer or multiple layers in the glass to provide additional diffraction orders or more complex control of the reflected wavefronts. These gratings can enable metrology of large specular surfaces with compact optical setups, such as a point source illumination and reflection into a camera, and can also be used to re-direct a small amount of sunlight to a direction offset from the specular direction to allow measurement of the mirror orientation while it directs most sunlight to a receiver for thermal energy generation. The gratings are written with ultrafast laser pulses, with pulse duration in the femtosecond to picosecond range, to impart index of refraction variation, scattering, or both, providing phase and/or amplitude modulation. Large optomechanical structures, such as heliostats used for solar energy concentration, require sub-milliradian precision surface metrology. Due to the large size and long focal lengths of these systems, accurately measuring these surfaces with a compact metrology system is difficult. Several techniques have been developed to overcome these limitations, such as photogrammetry, which is a process of attaching components to diffusely scatter light to the heliostat mirrors; however, attaching components increases measurement uncertainty, degrades robustness, and can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Phase gratings, which do not scatter or absorb light can be more useful for directing light differently based on wavelength, and gratings can be designed to modify the spectrum of reflected light.",

These two features not only improve on existing methods that require an efficient coupling medium for imaging, monitoring, modulation methods that use both light and sound but also enable new techniques that may not otherwise be feasible.

The researchers also propose novel solutions for inline photoacoustic \u201cflashlight\u201d adapters that co-align light and sound for optimal photoacoustic imaging\u2014the gellan gum not only provides a stable mechanical interface, but the very low optical scattering coefficient enables shaping of the optics before it reaches the sample to be interrogated. The researchers also provide evidence that optimal coupling materials with a proper design could enable efficient optical imaging of real-time changes in function during ultrasound modulation therapy for treating a variety of medical conditions from traumatic brain injury and stroke to peripheral neuropathy. There are fundamental challenges with efficiently and optimally delivering light and (ultra)sound through coupling materials that are placed between a device that emits and/or detects light and/or sound and coalignment is often desirable. Since air is not an efficient coupling material for (ultra)sound, water-based materials that have similar acoustic properties to tissue are often used for efficient coupling. However, liquid water does not exhibit attractive mechanical properties when integrated into many devices or administered at the tissue interface. As a result, water-based and rubber-based gels are sometimes employed since they possess much better mechanical stability than water. These gels, however, have a variety of undesirable acoustic properties and/or undesirable optical properties. Ultrasound modulation is an emerging field proposed to alter the function of cells and organs; however, the mechanisms and optimal pulse encoding strategies of US modulation are poorly understood, and there are few examples where imaging techniques have been applied in real-time with ultrasound pulse sequences/sound delivery.",

The oxfendazole ionic liquid containing nano formulations can lead to the development of low-cost oral treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis is a severe fungal infection of the central nervous system. Worldwide, nearly 220,000 new cases of cryptococcal meningitis occur each year, resulting in an estimated 181,000 deaths. Most of the illness and deaths are estimated to occur in resource-limited countries, among people living with HIV. Improved access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally has helped improve the immune systems of many HIV patients so that they are not at increased risk of cryptococcal meningitis. However, cryptococcal meningitis is still a major problem where HIV prevalence is high and where access to healthcare may be limited. This infection is extremely life threatening and has a high mortality rate. Despite the severity of the condition, there are few, if any, effective therapeutic options depending on the severity. Oxfendazole is a veterinary anthelmintic benzimidazole for the treatment of parasitic worms. The need for affordable antifungals to combat cryptococcal disease is unquestionable. Benzimidazoles are potentially attractive antifungal compounds that were introduced in clinical practice nearly 60 years ago to treat helminthic infections. In addition to being safe, their cost of treatment is extraordinarily low. Several studies suggested benzimidazoles as promising anticryptococcal agents combining low-cost and high antifungal efficacy.

The crosslinked nature of the technology overcomes the common drawback of current sponges\u2019 material releasing lots of dust and loose fiber that can be dangerous to humans in closed environments. The technology does not threaten respiratory systems while maintaining lower density and high water-retention properties. The other challenge is needed soil to grow crops with the sponges. To overcome this challenge and simplify the cellulose-based plant growth system, the technology controlled the component-structure-property-processing of cellulose materials for plant growth without soil.

The main purpose is to use non-scanning all-passive confocal optics to conduct two-dimensional confocal imaging. The invention uses multiple apertures for each of the illumination and detection masks to increase the imaging speed and improve image resolution compared to a single aperture. This can be used for diagnosis of skin diseases, corneal diseases, and other human diseases, as well as industrial inspection applications, such as inspection of defects on flat panel display devices. Microscopes have been an integral part of the medical field since their first use in 1563, and currently remain one of the most important diagnostic devices. Current microscopes utilize a single aperture to obtain images; however, advancements in the optical field have radically improved microscopes through the use of multi-apertures and approaches that improve image resolution and increased imaging speeds. Applications include medical imaging, non-invasive diagnostic tool, and industrial inspection applications. Advantages include higher resolution images, increased imaging speeds, the ability to provide cellular images of in vivo human tissue, and lower cost.",

    "ip_description": "This innovation is a universal high throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify inhibitors targeting a binding site of viral methyltransferases (MTases) with a methyl donor. The inventors developed a fluorescence polarization (FP)-based HTS assay to target reference MTases, an essential enzyme to methylate the 5\u2019-cap of viral RNA genome on SARS-CoV-2 and flavivirus. Pilot screening demonstrated that the HTS assay was very robust and identified two candidate inhibitors. Binding studies indicated that these molecules bound directly to the essential enzymes with similar low micromolar affinity. Moreover, the inventors further demonstrated that these molecules significantly inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and Zika virus in cell-based assays at concentrations not causing significant cytotoxicity. Overall, these molecules represent novel and promising candidates to further develop broad-spectrum inhibitors for management of viral infections. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic still persists even after vaccines have been introduced. Similarly, flaviviruses that cause diseases like Dengue Fever, West Nile Virus, Zika, and Japanese Encephalitis have caused outbreaks all over the world and there are only four working vaccines on the market for those conditions. These viruses often are zoonotic or use animals to infect humans. The single-stranded RNA allows for the viruses to quickly mutate and thus evade immune systems and human innovations, making it difficult for vaccines to remain 100% accurate. Viral methyltransferases methylate the 5\u2019-cap of viral genome, so if there is a way to target methyltransferases then the viral genome would be left to unravel and be deemed useless for reproduction.",

By using a paper-based microfluidic chip, this invention provides rapid detection of Perfluorooctanoic acid PFOAs in a lab. The procedure uses commonly available reagents to flow through a microfluidic chip while also loading it with the testing sample. Within 30 minutes of loading the sample, the scientist is able to gather their data. The readout time can be as low as five minutes. Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) comprise around 10,000 different human-made agents that can be added to liquids to decrease surface tension with other solids, liquids and gasses. They are commonly used in carpeting, upholstery, apparel, floor wax, textiles, firefighting foam and sealants. PFAS are comprised of carbon chains linked to fluorine, resulting in the strongest polar covalent bond between carbon and another atom; a strong bond means they do not degrade quickly. These inert chemicals pose a potential risk to humans and their monitoring needs improvement. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a specific type of PFAS, has been acknowledged as causing significant environmental damage to human health, being present in humans at a level of four parts per billion when 70 parts per trillion is considered the safe lifetime health advisory in drinking water by the EPA. Federal agencies are setting advisory levels of exposure and many state agencies are also enforcing regulations of limits on PFOA and PFAS contamination in drinking water. Current testing methods include high performance liquid chromatography, using methylene blue, or using a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP). Using these types of detection requires training and can also be very expensive. Furthermore, the MIP process requires more investigation and the chromatography can take multiple days to return results. Chromatography does have the best limit of detection by analyzing lateral flow immunoassay on a paper-based microfluidic chip. Applications: PFAS/PFOA detection, Flow-rate analysis. Advantages: Rapid, Inexpensive, Mobile.",

The sanitizer will irradiate UV light with multiple beam steering devices to selectively sterilize the different areas in a room. The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, created a pandemic that resulted in 775,431,269 infections, and a total of 7,047,741 deaths worldwide as of May 2024. The pandemic also led to a large demand for deployable sanitization solutions to eliminate, reduce, and control the viral transmission of the virus. Current UV sanitization solutions tend to be non-programmable, static, and fixed. UV sterilizers that are already on the market that utilize UV lightning as a germicide tend to be imprecise, as their UV radiation system only tend to illuminate different areas indiscriminately and non-uniformly.

    "ip_description": "This technology is a novel heart valve and deployment system that maintains eccentric geometries while optimizing valve function and hemodynamics, reducing adverse events. The asymmetrical leaflet design features two identical mirrored larger leaflets and one shorter leaflet. Traditional symmetric leaflet design features three equal leaflets that rely on diastolic closure with all leaflets meeting in the center and small bending forces needed in systole to open all leaflets. The larger leaflets preferentially open along the long axis of the ellipse and asymmetrical leaflets coopt off the center of the ellipse, shifting the cooption point along the long axis to increase the opening area. Increasing the angle of the commissural attachment further reduces the diastolic stresses. The leaflet configuration relies on alignment of the long axis of the valve between the commissures of the bicuspid aortic valve, which no delivery system can control/image at this time. Heart valve disease, such as Bicuspid Aortic stenosis, often results in eccentric valve geometry and orifices. The aortic valve separates the left lower heart chamber (left ventricle) and the body\u2019s main artery (aorta). Flaps of tissue (cusps) on the valve open and close with each heartbeat and make sure blood flows in the right direction. Usually, the aortic valve has three cusps. A bicuspid valve has only two cusps. Rarely, some people are born with an aortic valve that has one cusp (unicuspid) or four cusps (quadricuspid). Current prosthetic heart valves physically force valve orifices and surrounding structures to assume a circular geometry resulting in tissue strain and adverse events. Applications include heart valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Advantages include high durability, reduced structural stress, limited leaking, and improved biocompatibility.",

This innovation can swiftly evaluate whether a patient\u2019s heart rate is beating at an arrhythmic interval. This new clinical decision support system will be able to diminish the risk of sudden death due to inpatient cardiac arrests. Doctors may prescribe drugs to patients for the treatment of Torsades de Pointes, which can be diagnosed based on an arrhythmia in the QT interval on the ECG readout. Many medications can increase the risk of such an arrhythmia by negatively impact the heart, and this tool can help doctors be more aware of how medications are directly affecting patients. When cardiac arrest occurs, it can lead to limited oxygen reaching the body and brain and cause the patient to lose consciousness. The patient\u2019s organs may begin shutting down and result in irreversible damage. There are over 100,000 cardiac arrests in America alone, and about 6% of them are due to Torsades de Pointes (TdP).

Large omics data sets may be used from combinations of genomics, proteomics, lipids, etc. available from blood or other simple sample collection. This tool can robustly capture changes in this metric following short-term treatment with an anti-aging intervention. This timing reflects the likely point in life where a mammal might expect to receive such an intervention in the clinic. These drugs can then be prioritized for detailed examination in more costly preclinical longevity studies. Over the past four decades hundreds of interventions have been identified that extend lifespan in invertebrate model systems of aging. One major bottleneck in translating these interventions into clinical therapies to increase healthy longevity and treat age-associated disease in humans is the high cost in both time and resources associated with conducting longevity studies in preclinical mammalian models. In principle, one solution to this problem is to identify early- to mid-life biomarkers that can predict lifespan and other late-life markers of healthy aging. However, aging is driven by a complex interplay between many molecular and cellular processes, and biomarkers that provide consistent predictive efficacy across interventions, tissues, and disease types have been historically elusive.

    "ip_description": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory RNA molecules that bind to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and affect the stability or translational efficiency of the bound mRNAs. Single or dual-luciferase reporter systems have been successfully used to identify miRNA target genes in mammalian cells, however, they are not sensitive enough to verify miRNA\u2013target gene relationships in insect cell lines. The promoters for the target luciferase in insect cells are too weak to drive sufficient expression of the target luciferase in insect cells. This technology replaces the promoter used for the mammalian cells with a different promoter that has the potential to bind in insect cells. The promoter psiCHECK-2-TK has suitable insect cell luciferase activity ratios regardless of the cell line. PsiCHECK-2-TK was able to detect the interaction between Helicoverpa armigera miRNA9a and its target in both mammalian and H. zea cell lines; furthermore, psiCHECK-2-TK with the target sequence, HzMasc accurately differentiated between H. zea cell lines with or without the negative regulation factor of HzMasc. This demonstrates that psiCHECK-2-TK can be used to functionally characterize small RNA target genes in both mammalian and insect cells. Small non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), are important for regulating gene expression. miRNAs regulate many cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, reproduction, death, metabolism, and development. miRNAs will interact with its target gene through base pairing, but it is very specific and there needs to be a minimum of eight similar base pairs. Currently, there is only one commercially available dual-luciferase (a photoprotein that is bioluminescent when bonded to its target) reporter system that can verify RNA genes. With only one dual-luciferase on the market there is a possibility of many miRNAs that are not being identified do the specificity required.

    "ip_description": "This technology is an optical system with freeform elements that disperses and images the light from an object to a digital sensor for spectral imaging. Compared to traditional systems, which use rotationally symmetric optical systems with a separate dispersion element, the current invention is much more compact and low-cost. An optical system with freeform elements can also be designed for the object or image plane that is perpendicular to the optical axis. Furthermore, the use of freeform elements allows for greater flexibility in the design of the optical system, enabling customization for specific applications and imaging requirements. Hyperspectral imaging is a technique for acquiring data from the broad range of wavelengths extending beyond visible light. The technology has been found to have an extremely diverse range of applications even with an early-stage market, and many more techniques can be expected to be discovered in the near future. Most suppliers have achieved a compact form but lower costs and freeform elements are less common across their products. However, the lack of low-cost and compact hyperspectral imaging systems with freeform elements has limited the accessibility and adoption of this technology in various fields. Applications include Defense, Healthcare, Agriculture, Food inspection, Mining and materials, Environmental monitoring. Advantages include Compact, Low-cost, Free-form optical elements.",

Muscle invasion was tested by the ability of prostate cancer cells to colonize the inferior surface of the respiratory diaphragm of male NGS mice, invade into and through to the superior surface. They isolated and compared the biological, cellular, and molecular characteristics of \u201cInferior\u201d non-invasive tumor. \u201cMuscle-resident\u201d cells that invaded and now reside within the diaphragm muscle of \u201cSuperior\u201d cells that have completely traversed the diaphragm muscle. The results show that superior cells have gained the ability to reach a bone metastatic site, as detected by bioluminescence, PET/MRI, and history of the femur in 50% of animals as compared to no bone metastases in animals injected with Inferior cells. The Superior cells have a differential gene expression signature as compared to Inferior cells of 264 genes that was positively associated with metastatic prostate cancer in humans. Of significant interest is that muscle-resident tumor cells differentially expressed 84 genes compared to both the Inferior and Superior cancer cells, highlighting the unique environment of the active mouse muscle. Human prostate cancer cell lines are particularly difficult to establish, and most existing cell lines do not exhibit features commonly seen in human prostate cancer. Most available models either grow only _in vivo_ as xenografts or are androgen insensitive and fail to express prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The lack of functionally relevant model systems of advanced prostate cancer has limited prostate cancer research and therapy development. However, this technology focuses on the aggressive prostate tumors that invade through a smooth muscle pseudo capsule in a process called extracapsular extension (ECE), escaping organ confinement. The presence of ECE defines the pT3a category in the pathological staging of prostate adenocarcinoma and is associated with an increased risk of biochemical recurrence, distant metastasis, and cancer-specific mortality. Although muscle invasion is required for ECE and distant metastasis, the cellular phenotypes that dictate this behavior is not understood.",

Existing methods require a reference measurement ('normal') in every patient compared to a cancer-suspicious measurement. Instead, this method and endoscope provide for angle-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements associated with forward and backward scattered light that eliminate the need to obtain paired normal and cancer-suspicious measurements in each patient. Globally, colorectal cancer was the second leading cause of cancer death in 2021. Research suggests that collagen, a major structural protein, plays a pivotal role in cancer development and metastasis, and by extension patient prognosis. Collagen surrounding tumor cells undergoes structural changes that can be quantitatively studied with second harmonic generation (SHG), a subset of multiphoton microscopy (MPM). MPM as an imaging modality is difficult to implement in an endoscope because of the complex and expensive miniaturized scanning components required. Endoscope complexity can be greatly reduced by implementing a simpler, non-synchronized scanning mechanism. Applications include cancer diagnosis and semi-infinite tissue cancer diagnosis. Advantages include less imaging required, two simultaneous measurements taken, reliability, and quantitative diagnosis.",

    "ip_description": "Existing corner cube reflectors introduce unwanted polarization change to incident light. This invention provides a solution to remove this polarization change and thereby reduces polarization dependent loss and improves the performance of the reflector. This solution can be applied to both mirror-based and prism-based corner cube reflectors. This invention also includes a method to design and manufacture a corner cube reflector to precisely control the change of polarization using a compensation filter and/or coating. The polarization compensation filter is made of at least one layer of patterned birefringent material. In some embodiment, the filter is used to preserve the polarization of the incoming light, such that the polarization of the reflected light is the same as the incoming light for a range of angle of entry. In other embodiments, the filter is used to change the polarization of the incoming light to a predefined polarization, such that the polarization of the reflected light is equal to the predefined polarization for a range of angle of entry. Corner cube reflector is used extensively in many optical systems to redirect an incoming beam of light back toward its incoming direction. One advantage of the corner cube reflector is that it can reflect light at a range of angle of entry, making it an indispensable optical component for alignment. Another advantage is its small compact size, which can be tiled in an array to cover large areas. Applications of corner cube reflector include spectroscopy, road sign, free space optical communication, positioning, land survey, laser cavity, distance or time-of-flight measurement, interferometry, navigation, and precision alignment. A corner cube reflector is made of three intersecting and perpendicular flat reflectors. There are generally two types: one made of three flat mirrors, and one made of three-sided glass prism. In both types, light is reflected by each surface three times, either by the mirrors or by total internal reflection (TIR) at the glass-air interfaces. One disadvantage of the corner cube reflector is the change of polarization state after the reflections which is caused by the reflections of light and by the change of its direction of propagation. The latter change component is geometric in nature. Both change components depend on the location and angle of entry. Generally, reflector made of metal-coated mirror has smaller polarization change than reflector made of glass prism. For applications where the preservation of the polarization state is critical, a corner cube reflector that does not change the polarization state of the incoming light is needed.",

    "ip_description": "Methods of vulcanization using a high content sulfur polymer, instead of elemental sulfur, have been developed for tire rubber production. The resulting high sulfur content polymers are referred to as Chalcogenide Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Polymers (CHIP) materials have improved polymer compatibility and efficient crosslinking. Furthermore, this technology suppresses \"reversion,\" the loss of rubber stiffness over time, which is an undesirable quality.\n\nVulcanization of rubber and other polymeric materials is a well-established method for enhancing physical properties by chemical crosslinking. Vulcanized materials are generally more thermally, chemically, and physically robust than their non-vulcanized analogs. These increased characteristics are attributed to the formation of carbon-sulfur bonds which allow for bridging of the polymer chains by varying numbers of sulfur atoms to form crosslinked networks. While accelerator additives are used to increase the speed of vulcanization, thus permitting polymerization at lower temperatures and greater efficiency, vulcanization still requires high temperatures and suffers from inefficient mixing of components due to poor incompatibility which results in incomplete curing and undesirable decomposition. Hence, there is a need for technology for improved polymer compatibility and lower-temperature curing.\n\nApplications:\n* Tire rubber vulcanization\n* Latex manufacturing\n* Suitable for natural, synthetic, or a combination of materials\n\nAdvantages:\n* Improved solubility in tire rubber precursors compared to elemental sulfur and improved crosslinking\n* \"Reversion\" suppression",

    "ip_description": "This is a novel promoter for gene expression that can be used across species. By understanding the genetic makeup of animals and insects, we can learn how to improve human life. Viruses that affect crustaceans may be able to provide insight into genetic promoters that can interact with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.\n\nThere are different types of genetic expression. A gene can be expressed within the same species (i.e. homologous expression) or in a different species than the one in which it originates (i.e. heterologous). Baculovirus penaei (BP) has an affinity to bind with many different types of tissue, allowing it to be used to promote gene expression for various species. Genetic expression can occur for constitutive genes: those that are always expressed and for inducible genes and those that are only expressed under certain conditions or when their products are deemed necessary. BP can be a potential promoter for both types of genes.\n\nInitially discovered in 1974, Penaeus vannamei singly enveloped nuclear polyhedrosis virus (PsSNPV), was the first shrimp virus to be identified. Over the years, it has been analyzed using transmission electron microscopy and was categorized as similar to baculovirus that infects insects. This conclusion was reached based on the identification of a part of its genomic sequence, while the rest of the genome was unknown.\n\nCurrently, there are limited methods of promoting gene expression across species. Bacterial genetic promoters show some potential, but there has yet to be a solution. The discovery of the remaining genome \u2014 and its structural conservation \u2014 allow it to be used as a cross-species gene promoter, including bacteria, fungi, insects, mammals, and plants.\n\nApplications:\n* Gene expression promoter\n* Cross-species genomic applications\n\nAdvantages:\n* Eukaryotic and prokaryotic uses",

While some students may understand the basics of plagiarism, they may not know about issues pertaining to plagiarism unique to law school and the practice of law. This workshop was developed as a solution to address knowledge gaps about plagiarism in law school. Applications include plagiarism education, teaching how plagiarism is handled in law school and the practice of law, and teaching proper methods to quote, paraphrase, and cite source material. Advantages include a systematic method to teach about plagiarism, consideration of plagiarism issues specific to law school, teaching how plagiarism in law school differs from undergraduate, customization to different universities or institutions, addressing cultural perspectives on plagiarism, and addressing consequences of plagiarism both in law school and the legal profession in general.",

The tool is unique among prior art for its use of curettage instead of reaming (drilling). This tool can improve the process of removing tissue from a necrotizing infection while leaving adjacent healthy tissue intact. The project was funded by the University of Arizona\u2019s Department of Biomedical Engineering. Demand for orthopedic technology designed for surgical treatments like necrotic tissue removal and boring holes to remove material or create openings for implants has been and will continue to increase due to an increasing average population age and more frequent musculoskeletal diseases, trauma, and burns. At this time, high unit costs are prohibiting major market growth. Many of the products that are currently available for sale that resemble this technology are converging on a reaming-irrigating-aspirating system that can perform many functions at once to increase efficacy by reducing destructive invasiveness and time spent in surgery.

A premature stop codon associated with Lmod2 causes truncation of Lmod2. This innovation is the use of antisense for blocking the system that recognizes and prevents the premature stop codon, thereby allowing the truncated/mutant protein synthesis. Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body. Cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure. The main types of cardiomyopathies include dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Treatment \u2014 which might include medications, surgically implanted devices, heart surgery or, in severe cases, a heart transplant \u2014 depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and how serious it is. There might be no signs or symptoms in the early stages of cardiomyopathy, but as the condition advances, signs and symptoms usually appear and tend to get worse unless treated. Leiomodin-2 (Lmod2) is a regulator of the actin thin filament lengths within the heart muscle. Knockout of Lmod2 has been shown to result in dilated cardiomyopathy. The inventors show preliminary results that suggest that expressing either truncated/mutated Lmod2 results in improved cardiac function compared to no Lmod2 expression at all.",

This can provide a unique in vivo tool for the assessment of risks of toxicity associated with human exposure to environmentally hazardous chemicals and therapeutic drugs, using human albumin as a protein target. The researchers developed an alternative approach to the measurement of DNA adducts for assessing human exposure to hazardous chemicals through biomonitoring of protein-carcinogen adducts. Unlike DNA adducts, carcinogen-protein adducts do not undergo repair and are expected to have serum stabilities similar to that of the unmodified protein, expecting albumin adducts to accumulate during chronic exposure to genotoxicants. Albumin is critical in maintaining the colloid osmotic pressure and transporting hormones, fatty acids, and many xenobiotic compounds including therapeutic drugs, environmental pollutants, and chemical carcinogens. There is a critical need to establish animal models that express human proteins for mechanistic studies with xenobiotics and to facilitate the development and validation of analytical methods to measure protein adduct biomarkers prior to studies in humans. Transgenic mouse models with a systemic expression of human albumin have not yet been reported and this invention provides this.",

This technology enables a novel chemical probe for observing intact biological cells. It builds on previous IP developed by Jewett laboratory for protection, as a class of chemistry enabling stable compounds that then could release reactive species at biological pH, reducing intracellular environment, or via enzymatic release to elucidate biochemistry. This invention comprises a class of chemistry and method of use for small molecules with functional groups such that four conditions are met:\n\n1.  To protect the diazonium ion during delivery\n2.  Provide for cellular uptake\n3.  Provide for intracellular release of the diazonium ion\n4.  Optionally provide for the protein binding within the cell.\n\nSelectivity in biological systems comes from a complex interplay of location, interactions and reactivity. Covalent small-molecule probes offer great potential in the development of chemical tools to study intracellular proteins. A challenge within this area is in garnering selectivity associated with location. For example, in order to gain accessibility to intracellular proteins, small-molecule labeling strategies have relied on working with cell lysate, yet key contextual interactions associated with localization within the cell are lost during lysis.\n\nAryl diazonium ions are known for their selective reactivity with the electron-rich aromatic tyrosine side chain. But aryl diazonium ions for use as probes have suffered from a lack of deliverability since they have short half-lives and are generally unstable.\n\nThis invention provides probes, e.g., protected triazabutadiene probes, that selectively release benzene diazonium ions (BDIs) intracellularly, providing a tool for cellular studies in intact biological systems, e.g., a means for accessing and/or labeling intracellular proteins or molecules prior to cell lysis.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a new type of hybrid PV module that overcomes previous deficiencies of light loss and prohibitively high manufacturing cost. It takes a complete manufactured bifacial PV module as its starting point, which has single-junction PV cells sealed between thin glass windows. This module serves not only to harvest the energy of diffuse light, but also to carry and cool an array of small multijunction, III-V PV cells to harvest direct sunlight with very high conversion efficiency. The small cells are mounted to the module\u2019s front window on small copper/ceramic substrates. An array of lenses molded into a single sheet of glass is attached to the front of the apparatus to concentrate direct sunlight onto each of the MJ cells while transmitting diffuse light to the single junction cells. A very fast molding process for manufacturing the lens arrays is described in which relatively cold molds are used to form the lenses into a sheet of hot, soft glass. To maximize optical coupling efficiency and provide tolerance to wrong pointing, the concentrating optics include a second spherical glass lens and flat glass plate bonded to the MJ cell. Electrical power from the MJ cells is conducted to the edge of the module by copper wires attached also to the entrance window. In this invention, cooling of the multijunction cells, as needed to maintain their high conversion efficiency, is accomplished by conduction of heat through the base module\u2019s glass window. To maximize the heat flow, copper wires attached to the III-V cells are configured to conduct away heat as well as electrical power. Thermally conductive adhesive is used to bond these wires, as well as the cell substrates, to the glass window. Multijunction PV cells can now be made to convert sunlight with twice the efficiency of standard silicon modules. Despite hundreds of millions of dollars invested, no company has yet succeeded in commercializing this advantage. This invention builds on existing products and knowledge of the PV industry, advancing innovation in the renewable energy sector.",

This could be used for women who are suffering with symptoms of chronic pelvic pain and adenomyosis for diagnosis without an invasive hysterectomy. In preliminary studies, there have been high acceptance of a particular sampling, that can provide information reflecting uterine conditions due to anatomical continuity across the female reproductive tract. Thus, non-invasive sampling may allow detection of adenomyosis-related metabolites and proteins in the cervicovaginal microenvironment, which would address this urgent unmet need. Candidate biomarkers have been identified for non-invasive diagnosis of adenomyosis in cervicovaginal lavages by integrating immunoassays and metabolomics analyses. Adenomyosis is a highly prevalent yet enigmatic disease that can be diagnosed only via histopathology among women undergoing hysterectomy, thus, leading to underdiagnosis. Research progress on adenomyosis has been limited due to a variety of challenges: 1. Adenomyosis lacks both a clear etiology and clinical/pathological phenotyping 2. There are no established diagnostic guidelines 3. There are no clear criteria for assessment of treatment response 4. Adenomyosis co-occurs with other gynecologic conditions. Based on the challenges outlined, little work has been done on non-invasive diagnostics for adenomyosis, and currently there is no FDA-approved non-invasive method for early detection of adenomyosis, as it is only diagnosed by surgical intervention. Thus, there is an urgent and unmet need for identifying novel diagnostic biomarkers and pathophysiological mechanisms based on non-invasive sampling, which could lead to earlier intervention and treatment.",

Patients undergoing lung biopsy are often instructed to hold their breath while a CT scan is performed to determine if the trajectory of the needle is in line with the target lesion. However, many patients cannot reasonably hold their breath for the duration of the scan, let alone the brief time for interpretation of the scan including triangulating the trajectory of the needle and the target and then the time it takes for appropriate advancement of the needle to the target. During this interval from scan to needle advancement to the target, the needle tip moves with respirations and lung movement. This technology aims to overcome the limitations to external guidance of needles with use of the electrodes to determine if the needle is heading in the right direction. The technology also provides bioimpedance-based electrical control of bleeding complications. Applications include a wide range of biopsies. Advantages include ease of use, better biopsy needle guidance, control of bleeding complications, and improved patient care.",

They can also be used as carriers with cargo drug from natural or synthetic products with higher bioavailability. The variety of plant categories also provide broad resources for lower cost production. Culture conditions may also be cost effective and so these vesicles are promising new drug delivery systems or could also be carrying biomarkers for targeted deliveries. Use in diagnostics, therapies, CBRN medical countermeasures but also in consumer products for cosmetics or food products are other foreseen embodiments. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-size lipid bilayer particles playing the role of cell-to-cell communication system in multicellular organisms through the bioactive cargo they carry such as protein, small regulatory RNA, or lipids in addition to fragments of DNA. Recently, EVs, and exosomes have drawn attention for their therapeutic potential in disease such as neurological disorder or cancer. Interestingly, EVs demonstrated important biological functions associated with radiation damage response, such as the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and promotion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, the alleviation of oxidative stress, anti-apoptosis effect and proliferation stimulation. Thus, these EVs are investigated as potential radiation medical countermeasures (MCMs) for radiation-induced skin, lung, and bone injuries. However, the role of EVs in clinic is still subject to several technical and biological challenges that include the production of sufficient quantities, the risk of mycoplasma and other microbial contamination or their high heterogeneity in composition, size, subpopulations that limit therapeutic applications. Therefore, to overcome such challenges, recent studies have explored the use of EVs derived from vegetal kingdom (pEVs). The invention here explores the ways in which plant-based EVs can be utilized for enhancing the aforementioned applications. Applications: Diagnostics, Therapies, Food products, Cosmetics. Advantages: Higher bioavailability, Cost effective, Broad resources.",

This innovation may enable high-rate communication in the presence of noise and high precision quantum radar detection. Upon receiving the return of the signal, the receiver first performs a heterodyne or homodyne detection on the return. Next, phase shift and beam splitting are performed on the idlers. Finally, homodyne or photon counting is performed on the idlers. Entanglement-assisted protocols entangle an initial signal with an ancilla for entanglement-assistance, which is jointly measured with the received signal to boost the information extraction performance. Focus is given to microwave or optical sensing and communication. The long-standing problem in designing receivers and protocols that can operate with noise is solved by converting the quantum problem into a semi-classical one. By combining a conversion module with a standard optimal coherent-state receiver, optimal receiver design is achieved for various applications. For example, a design for quantum illumination target detection only relies on off-the-shelf components of heterodyne detection, quadrature displacement, and photon detection.

This method utilizes confined plates to apply external stimuli, such as temperature and electric fields, allowing for precise control over the crystallization process during film formation. As a result, RAPID improves film quality and enhances scalability for electronics manufacturing. Traditional printing techniques for solution- processed electronics, such as slot-die coating and doctor blading, offer limited control over key processing parameters. These methods often lack the ability to precisely adjust factors such as nucleation rates, which directly influence the quality of the resulting thin films. In contrast, the RAPID technique provides enhanced tunability by controlling parameters like print speed, which affects the formation and growth of nuclei before solvent evaporation. This improved control offers the potential for significantly optimizing thin film production in electronic applications. Applications include thin-film electronics, solar cells and other photovoltaic devices, and energy storage devices. Advantages include enhanced control over nucleation and crystallization processes during printing, improved scalability for manufacturing, and large-scale manufacturing (roll-to-roll manufacturing).",

By combining heralded photonic Bell pair generation with spectral mode conversion to interface with quantum memories, the scheme eliminates switching losses due to multiplexing.\n\nBased on numerical analyses, the protocol is estimated to achieve >102 ebits per second at memory multiplexing of 104 spin qubits for ground distance >104 km, with the spin-spin Bell state fidelity exceeding 99%. The architecture presents a potential blueprint for realizing global-scale quantum networks in the near future.\n\nGlobal markets for quantum applications maintain high growth across many disciplines during this decade despite the many problems of the early 2020s. Many high-profile companies are investing and researching in the area, and it is likely they will begin integrating hybrid systems within the decade. Given that this innovation stands to impact global-scale networks, it may be extremely worthwhile to explore.\n\nMultiplexing allows higher single-photon probabilities and lower contamination from higher-order photon states. It can be achieved through using time, space, or frequency degrees of freedom to parallelize spontaneous photon creation across modes, then actively switch the photons into a single output mode based on feedback from heralding detection events.\n\nAlthough single photons are ideal for application purposes, often, more than one photon is produced by a source. Once produced, the state tends to encounter nonzero optical loss before reaching the application. This loss is a transformation that results in a state that contains both vacuum and multiphoton components along with the desired single photon.\n\nApplications:\n*   Secure communications\n*   Aerospace networks\n*   Optical entanglement distribution\n*   Blueprint for global-scale quantum networks\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Zero added loss\n*   Applicable to global-scale networks\n*   High market growth across disciplines",

Since the heliostat field in a concentrated solar power project can account for up to 50% of the capital cost, these reductions are critical to budget management.\n\nResearchers at the UArizona demonstrated a prototype that forms solar disc images throughout the day at the cost of additional motor-driven actuators and a system for control and power. However, the actively focused heliostat is simpler and less expensive; it requires no added motors or control systems.\n\nTo obtain a high concentration in a field of many heliostats that all direct sunlight toward a receiver, it must be possible to pack them closely together without the light reflected from one heliostat being blocked by the other.

Here, the inventors present calcimycin (CMN) as a novel treatment of cryptococcosis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans (Cne) and likely Cryptococcus gattii (Cga). CMN prevents the protein from continuing to splice. While the current treatment methods do not prevent intein splicing, based on a study done on mice, CMN has been shown to be effective at reducing the fungal load of cryptococcosis and may also be extended for use against other intein splicing pathogens. Cryptococcosis is a pulmonary or disseminated infection acquired by inhalation of soil contaminated with the encapsulated yeasts Cryptococcus neoformans or C. gattii. Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii affects hundreds of millions of people a year, with almost 200,000 deaths annually. In immunocompromised individuals, such as those suffering from AIDS/HIV, fungal infection is the leading cause of death. Patients who had COVID-19 are also more likely to become infected by these fungal diseases. One strategy for treating these infections in humans is splicing on inteins from a proprotein precursor that is essential for proteins hosting inteins elements. Humans do not have a known intein splicing mechanism. Calcimycin was identified from a high throughput drug screening as having inhibitory activity against Cne and Cga. Further in vitro testing identified calcimycin as having potent intracellular inhibitory activity against Cne in macrophages. Moreover, calcimycin demonstrated inhibitory activity against intein splicing and was safe in mice while concomitantly reducing the fungal load in the lung.

    "ip_description": "Rethinking the structural organization of a polymer is a normally forgone solution for improving polymer flexibility. Here, the inventors have created four improved ways to manufacture polymers. The first is to create it at its mid-stress point, the second is to make the polymer with a shifting neutral axis, the third method uses polymers to provide support at high-stress points along with the polymer, and the fourth is to use fibers as the support system. All these methods increase the amount of stress that a device can undergo, and it can be used for a longer time. Method and process of making polymeric devices primarily applies to medical and healthcare devices (e.g. heart valve), but also includes polymeric materials for sports, industry, manufacturing, etc. Current polymers are manufactured in a rigid neutral state, meaning it has to experience full force in all directions when bent. They are not given any extra support, leaving them weaker than they could be. The new methods of manufacturing polymers in a partially flexed state will allow it to experience less stress in its flexed states. Current polymers do not apply neutral axis shifting, but changing this would help decrease wear over time on the structure of the material. Manufacturing polymers with a cyclic shift in the neutral axis will increase the life of the polymer as it allows the polymer to experience constant stress and strain over a rotating axis. Current polymers and resins are usually made as a whole part, without any support, or extra support at areas of high tension. Polymers can also be strengthened by increasing the amount of support they have at their high-stress point, and also ensuring that there is no intra-material failure. Another method that is being proposed to increase the strength of polymers is to add fibers that increase durability by supporting the polymer bi-axially. By using a bulking polymer at high-stress locations polymers are better able to distribute the stress. Along with using bulking polymers to strengthen the structure, adding fibers can also increase the strength of a material.",

Another application, for a more commercial audience, would be to use this algorithm in Alexa-like devices to allow parents to match behaviors of their children to receive a correct or appropriate diagnosis. Currently, there are standardized algorithms used for diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children. However, this technology claims to have the largest set of examples in the text data set. The utilization of such a large data set could be imperative to progressing the accuracy of ASD testing and diagnosis in young children. The technology also has clinical and commercial applications, allowing technicians to train and better recognize signs of ASD in children at varying stages and with more specificity, while also allowing parents to monitor their children in their natural environments and readily compare their behaviors to a catalog of examples and clinical text to present to their clinician.",

Highlighting is performed based off different criterion and displayed in different colors. There is also a summary count of all criteria found and their frequencies provided via this software. The diagnosing process for autism is difficult since there is no medical test that pinpoints the disorder. In order to diagnose ASD doctors, clinicians need to look at a variety of characteristics within an individual, such as childhood developmental history and their behaviors. Along with symptom variation and doctor waitlists, diagnoses can be a tricky and a long process. This software will greatly assist with this through its ability to evaluate submitted text which in turn generates an output that highlights text that is relevant to ASD diagnosing characteristics. Each of these identified characteristics in the text is highlighted and segmented based on the different criterion for diagnosing these disorders. This will significantly reduce diagnoses times and will be easily implementable across many clinics due to its feasibility. Applications: Online tool for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder in a clinical setting.

This effect can be controlled by the system to perform a progressive envelopment of an intended target in a microgravity environment. The system has no dependency on mechanical components. This avoids system complexity, reduces overall system mass/volume, and keeps power requirements at a minimum. Additionally, as the system only exerts small amounts of force on targets in microgravity, mishandling in the form of unwanted spinning or potential collisions is highly unlikely. Tethers provide solutions to a variety of problems in space. For example, the Space Surveillance Network tracks over 27,000 pieces of orbital debris, but there are many more pieces too small to be tracked which still pose a threat to human and robotic spaceflight. Tethers offer an inexpensive and efficient solution while maintaining low chances of mishandling. Additionally, there are 105 countries to date that have at least one satellite in space, and the number of man-made devices will only increase in the coming decades. These devices must currently hold propellant and a mechanism for dispersing it, but this can be replaced by tethers which will precisely reposition the devices in a variety of desirable methods. This concept has even been explored for repositioning the International Space Station. Applications include in-orbit servicing, space debris handling, satellite repositioning, handling of objects as small as CubeSats, and handling of objects as big as asteroids and space stations.

The lack of specificity of current standard of care treatments with low efficacy and tolerability makes CD a medical therapeutic challenge. One major limitation to developing new medical therapies is the lack of human relevant model systems. Here, the inventors harvested human pituitary adenoma tissue during transsphenoidal surgery from patients to generate organoids (hPITOs). They utilized several methods to investigate the organoid model, including a high-throughput drug screen that demonstrated patient-specific drug responses of hPITOs amongst each adenoma subtype. The reported findings of this study are conclusive and demonstrate that from these patient-derived organoids the treatment of Cushing\u2019s Disease may be improved. Cushing\u2019s Disease is a serious endocrine disorder in which benign tumors release a hormone that stimulate the adrenal glands to overproduce cortisol. Chronic exposure to excess cortisol has adverse effects on the body, including increased stroke rates, diabetes, obesity, cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, and death. Yet the primary treatment for CD, which is pituitary surgery, has a disease remission rate in only 47% of patients. Therefore, treatments for CD must improve.

This filter also works to improve overall system performance.\n\nThe technology proposed can be applied to biomedical, remote sensing and computer vision applications to improve the resolution of hyperspectral images collected.

The method may be used to analyze numerous characteristics, such as numbers of defects or defect density, stability, surface composition, band gap, physical structure, electroactivity, band bending, migration/diffusion process, and charging effects. This probe technology can be used in the manufacturing or analysis of thin film stacks to improve their performance and robustness. At present, the connection between the fundamental research to tailor and control chemical processes and the engineering of materials manufacturing is complicated, which often means performance of electronic materials or devices is less than desired. Some of the key shortcomings in conventional manufacturing processes of electronic devices or semiconductor films include, but are not limited to, _in situ_ characterization (observe processes under conditions that replicate real-world and real-time conditions) and _operando_ characterization (direct visualization and characterization of processes in real time under applied electric fields and flux conditions). Such methods that allow _in situ_ and/or _operando_ characterization of electronic devices and/or semiconductor materials during manufacturing and/or operation, respectively, will promote stronger ties between basic and applied research, and enhance rates of commercialization of viable technologies based on these optoelectronic materials. Besides knowledge, these techniques are essential analytical tools that can follow chemical reactions, physical processes, microstructural changes, and interfacial phenomena in real-world conditions. For the high-throughput production of (opto)electronic devices (ex. solar cells), state-of-the-art multi-model characterization capabilities, as well as novel inline sensors, are needed to follow (electro)chemical (e.g., intermolecular interactions, interfacial processes, defects, etc.) and/or physical (drying, crystal formation, surface tension, etc.) processes during the roll-to-roll, blade coating, slot-die, ink-jet, and/or various forms of spray printing, manufacturing operation across length and time scales, or to understand device\u2013transport layer interactions.

This increased discrimination provides the operator with a unique ability to determine the stability of the fully assembled viral particles even if the AAV preparation comprises partially filled virions, over-filled virions, and/or various assemblies of capsid proteins lacking a nucleic acid cargo. Gene therapy and vaccine delivery using adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a vector has emerged as a novel therapeutic modality that has the potential to lead to substantial disease modification in many monogenic disorders, or perhaps even cures. The interest in this approach has been boosted by the recent approval of two AAV-based gene therapies by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Over the last 5 years the number of clinical trials for commercial use have grown tremendously and AAVs are being used more now than ever before. Differential scanning fluorimetry or differential scanning calorimetry are commonly used to measure the thermal stability of AAVs, but these global methods are unable to distinguish the stability of different AAV subpopulations in the same sample. The goal of this invention is to characterize the stability and unfolding pathways of adeno-associated viral (AAV) capsids, which compose the packaging for efficient viral delivery. Conventional methods for this include charge detection-mass spectrometry (CD-MS) which reports on the solvent exposed surface area of the complex.

This is an improvement on previous technology that increases sensitivity of defect detection in device-relevant triple cation perovskites. The development of next-generation flexible optoelectronic devices has focused on the incorporation of solution processable lead halide perovskite materials as an active layer because of their high-power conversion efficiency and easy accessibility. In the last decade, the certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells have leaped from 3.8% to a maximum of 25.2% reached in 2020. Although various routes such as compositional engineering, interface modification, surface passivation and encapsulation have been attempted to improve device efficiency, the record for flexible perovskite solar cells is advancing rather slowly, especially in modules. As a result, novel techniques are needed to examine recent work more closely to expedite innovation toward higher PCEs by characterizing and controlling defect populations and improve long-term stability by understanding underlying chemical-physical-electronic equilibration mechanisms to enhance scalability and enable broad applicability. In 2016, a novel \u201ctriple cation\u201d reproducible perovskite with more pure and highly monolithic grains was developed that demonstrated consistent PCEs above 20%. Since then, these perovskites have attracted a broad interest based on their increased absorption, improved stability, decrease in interfacial recombination and number of defects. While their efficiency approximates silicon\u2019s lab record, lattice distortions, grain boundaries, impurities in the perovskite\u2019s crystal lattice and most importantly the connection with other layers contribute to phase instabilities, electronic defects and ion migration that are exacerbated under photon flux, heat, humidity, and/or electrical bias. Once ions leave the lattice they propagate through the active layer not only as defects, but also as active chemical species. In the last 5 years, the interest in quantifying this number of defects has grown tremendously, which caused a surge in the number of methodologies to detect or predict them.

This practical technique does not require much computation overhead compared with current systems and can be done with existing hardware to improve the operation of existing and new cameras. The image resolution of many cameras is often limited by the number and size of the pixel. One common problem in imaging is the finite dynamic range of the sensor. An image taken at the optimal exposure condition can have saturated highlights, flat shadows or both. The main cause of the problem is that the intensity range of the scene is often larger than the dynamic range of the imaging system. This technique is different from existing improvement methods of shifting the sensor relative to the image by a fraction of a pixel pitch and/or using machine learning to generate higher resolution images. Applications include improving image resolution. Advantages include: Can be used with existing hardware, Fast, Adjustable, Easy to use, Does not require editing software.",

    "ip_description": "Innovators at the University of Arizona have overcome the non-uniformity issue of thin-film Lithium Niobate. Adaptive profile poling is promising to realize high nonlinear efficiency with strong material second-order nonlinearity. Nonlinear efficiency can actually increase quadratically with length using this method. It was shown that the optical momentum mismatch caused by the thickness variation of thin-film Lithium Niobate wafers limits the overall nonlinear efficiency. In contrast to standard periodic poling where the domain inversion period is fixed, a near-ideal sinc function second-harmonic spectrum can be recovered. Lithium Niobate is inert and difficult to etch. For decades, waveguides have used ion diffusion or proton exchange which suffer small index contrast and bulky, non-scalable, and expensive devices which require a large driving voltage. Furthermore, uncertainties in the ion implantation depth and chemical-mechanical polishing rate cause thickness variations of the device layer. This non-uniformity has prevented the repeatable demonstration of high-performance nonlinear devices, as well as the large-scale photonic circuits based on thin-film Lithium Niobate. By implementing adaptive profile poling of nanophotonic Lithium Niobate waveguides, the innovators offer the potential for high overall nonlinear efficiency and future chip-scale integration of classical and quantum photonic systems.",

    "ip_description": "This technology utilizes optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) to collect high resolution temperature measurements in biochemical applications. More specifically, accuracy of measurements is increased in the spatial domain via the OFDR technology being studied in conjunction with whispering gallery mode biochemical sensing. While temperature measurements are currently investigated with a reported temperature uncertainty of 30mK, this same technology could increase the accuracy of other parameters in biochemical sensing. Biochemical sensing techniques often have inherent noise within the resultant measurements. This technology that employs Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry helps to reduce thermal drift noise, thus increasing the accuracy of measurements in biochemical applications. Additionally, other current techniques in biochemical settings include systems that employ tagging of specimens. With the studied use of this technology with Whispering Gallery Mode Biochemical Sensing, this is a label-free technique. Finally, with the reduced noise capabilities of this technology, resulting temperature measurements have shown increased spatial resolution. It is hypothesized that this accuracy would carry over to other parameter measurements. The technique is also capable of calibrating the microcavities used so that lower levels of detection are possible.",

Based upon live camera information, it creates a computer generated hologram (CGH) used to focus the LiDAR scans on specific areas of interest, improving real-time detection and tracking of important objects in the field of view. Light Detection and Ranging, or LiDAR, is used to determine the range of an object by bouncing a laser off a distant object. When the laser is scanned over multiple areas in sequence, it can begin to map the shape of an object and track its movement. These techniques are used in many applications, including surveying, mapping, earth and atmospheric sciences, military applications, and autonomous vehicles. To be most effective in a dynamic environment where there are moving objects or the LiDAR source is moving (such as in autonomous driving applications), LiDAR detection needs to be both high resolution and fast. This technology seeks to meet this requirement by focusing most of the laser scanning on areas of interest, rather than scanning the entire field of view equally. Applications include LiDAR, real time object detection, autonomous vehicles, and 3D sensing. Advantages include fast operation, reduced computational load, and focusing detection on important areas of interest.",

    "ip_description": "Second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy has become a powerful modality for imaging a diverse range of tissues. A preliminary study demonstrated that non-imaging, randomly sampled SHG intensity measurements are likely sufficient to distinguish normal colorectal tissue from tumor/tumor-adjacent tissue with digital simulation of random sampling. While SHG images have been used endoscopically for tumor diagnosis before, the process of taking an SHG image complicates the endoscope and sets lower limits on the size, due to the necessity of scanning mechanisms. The novelty of the proposed non-imaging measurements is the feasibility of a much simpler and smaller endoscope that returns a quantitative value instead of relying on an observer to interpret an image. Colon cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States, excluding skin cancers, and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths when men and women are combined. Despite the high death and case counts, the case rates and death rates have been decreasing the last few years. This type of cancer has a 65% 5-year survival rate. The reason for these decreases is in part due to better screening. This technology will improve screening and result in a continued decrease in cases and deaths. Non-imaging SHG measurements will be used in colonoscopies and other endoscopic procedures to identify and differentiate normal versus cancerous tissue and identify surgical margins in real-time. This would replace conventional methods for sampling and identifying suspicious samples as it is much more reliable since it gives a quantitative assessment for whether there is cancerous tissue present. The reason that is better is because it is definitive, and patients don\u2019t need to rely on a doctor interpreting an image correctly. It will be very helpful when there are very small areas of cancerous tissue that may have been difficult to see with the naked eye.",

The CLN1 and CLN2 genes regulate the production of these enzymes, respectively. Batten Disease, or Neural Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL), is a family of rare diseases caused by the autosomal recessive genetic mutations. Batten Disease is an inherited genetic disorder that affects the function of lysosomes and result in imbalance of the homeostasis of the cell and a consequential build-up of proteins and lipids. These diseases are currently incurable and healthcare providers focus on treating the symptoms of the disorder. The CLN1 gene is responsible for the production of the enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) and deficiency of this enzyme leads to abnormal buildup of lipids and proteins. In CLN1 disease, symptoms can be seen before age 1 and progress rapidly. Developmental skills such as standing, walking, and talking are not achieved or are gradually lost. Children often develop seizures by age 2 and eventually become bind. By age 3, children often are completely dependent upon caregivers and may need a feeding tube. Most affected children die in early to mid-childhood. For CLN2 disease, the tripeptidyl peptidase (TTP1) enzyme is insufficiently active. Developmental delay will usually begin around the age of 2 and children will develop seizures and begin to gradually lose their ability to walk and speak. Brief, involuntary jerks in muscles or muscle groups typically begin around age 4-5. By age 6, children often are completely dependent upon caregivers and may need a feeding tube. Most children with CLN2 disease will die between the ages of 6-12; however, symptoms can develop around this time in some children, and they will experience a slower disease progression, possibly living into their teenage years. Applications: Treatment of CLN1, Treatment of CLN2. Advantages: Novel small molecule treatment approach, Enzymatic activity is able to be rescued, Increased potency, Increased cell viability.",

The network makes use of simultaneous discrete variable (DV) and continuous variable (CV) entanglement unlike existing state of the art quantum networks, making it ideal for serving as the backbone of a quantum internet. Quantum communication networks are important because they provide a higher level of security than traditional communications. To protect traditional communications, encryption is typically applied. But as computers get faster, they can break encryption protocols more easily, and encryption often has other security flaws and can slow down communications. Quantum communication, on the other hand, is inherently more secure and has the potential for higher speeds. Hybrid CV-DV quantum states can be entangled and measured when working with light-based communications. Traditionally, when creating light-based quantum networks, the light is either treated like a particle, leading to DV-based quantum technologies, or the light is treated like a wave, leading to CV-based quantum technologies. However, recent research has suggested a third approach, the hybrid CV-DV approach, which does both. This technology serves to build upon that research to create a practical and effective implementation of hybrid CV-DV quantum communications.

This invention offers a method to offset carbon emissions for industries where carbon-neutral operations are particularly challenging (e.g., airlines, shipping). This invention offers a scalable solution to efficiently extract CO2 from the atmosphere by utilizing a novel combination of a UArizona patented, low-cost photobioreactor system, which has an excellent track record of growing photosynthetic algae, and a particle filtration system. Due to the intrinsic scalability of this invention, it has a potential to provide the most cost-effective solution to massive (hundreds of Ktons to Gtons-level) CO2 extraction, thereby contributing to reducing the impact of climate change and meeting demands for such capabilities if carbon taxes are introduced worldwide. Transitioning industrial processes worldwide to carbon-neutral operations is a necessity yet an enormously expensive technological and economic challenge. If companies can utilize reliable sources of carbon offsetting, then the total world emissions will greatly decrease, and we can slow the impacts of global warming. Energy is the number one cause of greenhouse gas emissions which is why this invention is an attractive alternative for shipping companies, airlines, and data centers where energy and fuel use is inevitable. Greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 43% from 1990 to 2015. If the number keeps growing at that rate, global warming will be irreversible, and the impact will be massive. As more and more companies pledge to become carbon neutral, it has become difficult to find scalable solutions that are cost-effective. The invention described here offers a scalable solution to efficiently extract CO2 from ocean water (a gigantic reservoir of CO2 that is coupled to the atmosphere) by utilizing a novel combination of photobioreactor and particle filtration system. Three regions of the world (East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and the United States) account for about 74% of the total emissions.

    "ip_description": "This invention provides compositions and method of pain treatment using a mixture of an opioid receptor agonist in combination with an adrenoreceptor modulator compound. The opioid receptor agonist may be a clinically-used drug, and the adrenoreceptor modulator compound is a novel small molecule. Proof-of-concept testing in animals has shown analgesic effect without reward behavior. Opioids continue to be widely used for pain treatment. However, constant opioid treatment is accompanied with serious undesirable effects including drowsiness and mental clouding, nausea and emesis, constipation and in many cases dependence and addiction. Continuous use of opioid therapy also develops analgesic tolerance and hyperalgesia in many patients. These unwanted effects significantly diminish the patients\u2019 quality of life. The mechanisms for these side effects are still largely unclear. However, one particular side effect, namely addiction, is a cause for great concern in pain treatment using opioids. Prescription opioids can be highly addictive and are widely misused. It has been estimated that the total economic cost of opioid misuse in the United States is $78.5 billion per year. The opioid crisis has been exacerbated by over-prescription of opioid pain-relievers for the treatment of pain. Due at least in part due to over-prescription and additive nature of opioids, some who experience chronic pain may suffer undertreatment. In fact, in many parts of the developing world, access to opioids even for acute pain and/or cancer pain can be restricted due to concerns over addiction and overdose. Even in the United States, some patients can suffer from an undertreatment of pain. For example, patients with cognitive impairment and the elderly can be especially susceptible to the central nervous system effects of traditional opioids such as morphine and in some cases are not prescribed enough to meet their pain management needs.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a system to create a shock impulse on the ground. It operates through a gear-motor that rotates a crank which lifts a linear slider. The slider is mounted in a massive body hammer that compresses a concentric spring on the slider shaft when the gear-motor rotates the crank. This causes the crank to rotate freely and the hammer to drop, creating a shock impulse into a strike plate. The use of a one-way bearing prevents any kind of bounce back and chatter in the impulse signal. This proposed technology fills the need to create an active seismic source on interplanetary landing spacecraft for the characterization of lunar and planetary geology. Natural seismic events are unpredictable both in terms of timing and content. Thus, an artificial signal created on demand and with a known seismic signal content is strongly desired. However, many terrestrial analogs require ordnance or are very heavy and require large power draw. This technology features a compact, lightweight design that relies on low power consumption, which as a result is much more desirable for spacecraft which have extremely limited resources for mass and energy. The global space economy is expected to grow by more than $700 billion in the next 20 years, and with new technologies come more possibilities. Spacecraft are projected to see a CAGR greater than 8%. The proposed technology will work great when attached to spacecraft and with the demand and market growing, it opens up the possibilities of adding this technology to future spacecraft.",

This could be utilized to have the balloon blow with the wind, using no propulsion, to any destination of choice. The possibility of station keeping above a certain point on the ground or executing a desired flight path are also available. High altitude balloons are very useful in many applications. They can be used for various applications including weather monitoring, communication, remote sensing, imaging, and many more. The market is growing rapidly with funding from the government.

    "ip_description": "This invention describes a novel platform to control expression of specific plant genes with viruses. When many plants are challenged with a viral infection, one of the primary defense mechanisms they have evolved is to deploy the use of plant RNA silencing pathways to control gene expression. Likewise, viruses have co-evolved to evade this mechanism with viral suppressors of RNA silencing. In this technology, the inventors propose the use of a novel system that uses these defense mechanisms in plants to create a modular switch that can be attached to any gene of interest in a plant and can be controlled by the presence of a virus. The proposed Virus Inducible Switch (VIS) design is based on artificial miRNA regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) by targeting synthetic 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 untranslated regions (UTRs) of any mRNA. Applications include a gene regulating system with wide-ranging life sciences research applications and plant gene regulating with wide-ranging agricultural applications such as disease monitoring and control. Advantages include that expression can be controlled with a virus-inducible switch and it uses existing plant mechanisms.",

    "ip_description": "Entanglement -Assisted (EA) Communication and Sensing has been advocated by numerous authors as a potential alternative to classical communications, in particular in noisy and low-brightness regime. This technology proposes an EA scheme employing the optical phase-conjugation (OPC) on transmitter side. It shows that the proposed EA communication system, with the transmitter side OPC, significantly outperforms its classical counterpart in low-brightness and highly noisy regime, while employing a classical coherent detection scheme for two-dimensional demodulation. Moreover, the capacity of the proposed EA scheme is significantly higher than EA repetition-BPSK, homodyne, heterodyne, and Holevo capacities. Finally, the proposed EA scheme outperforms the corresponding EA scheme with OPC placed on a receiver side. The problem with quantum entanglement devices is that they are easily electromagnetically (meaning light, magnetism, etc) interfered with. It is particularly difficult for the transmitter (the sender of the signal) to send information to the receiver. This tech solves the problem using Optical Phase Conjugation: process where an incoming electromagnetic wave is reflected with a reversed phase, so called \u201ctime-reversal of electromagnetic waves,\u201d allows cancellation of spatial distortion introduced into the incoming beam. Think of it as a way to outright screen off static. This communication is being investigated by NASA and other large entities could disrupt the current transmitter markets.",

    "ip_description": "This innovation uses a deep learning algorithm to learn a curvature parameterization to apply to the line-of-sight unit vector provided by a missile guidance navigation system. In one implementation the bias is computed using a deep neural network with a recurrent layer which allows the network to predict future target behavior from the history of target behavior during the engagement. The network is optimized using meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) over an ensemble of engagement scenarios with varying target behavior. Other applications could include spacecraft guidance navigation and control. This method is compatible with both passive sensors and single loop integrated guidance and control. Potential hardware implementations of the innovation are software running on a CPU or tensor processing unit (TPU), and neuromorphic implementations. Proportional navigation (PN) and related missile guidance laws are not optimal for the case of a maneuvering target guidance laws for maneuvering targets include the augmented PN (APN) guidance law, where the commanded acceleration from the PN guidance law is augmented with an additional term that is a function of the estimated target acceleration. However, although APN works well with targets maneuvering with a constant acceleration, its performance can actually be worse than standard PN for weaving targets and other more complex target maneuvers. A missile system company implementing the innovation would obtain a significant competitive advantage. Applications include aerospace and defense, missile guidance and control systems, and potential use in spacecraft guidance and control systems. Advantages include greater accuracy, greater control, adaptive missile guidance, and adaptive target tracking.",

The system also features a method for solid-state preservation of DNA data on synthetic bone or a metal-organic nanoparticle matrix using the supercritical nitrogen drying (ScND) process. With these features, the system will be able to provide a tailored error correction-based DNA data storage device and a solid-state preservation of DNA data storage to overcome all the existing challenges of high-density data storage. Synthetic DNA storage is a promising candidate with high density and long-term preservation for archival storage systems. If non-biological information is stored and distributed over prolonged periods of DNA, artificial protection is required because of degradation from hydrolysis, water, UV radiation, oxidation, ROS, ionizing radiation, heat, mutagenic chemicals or nucleases, and pH. Traditional DNA data storage methods have logistical constraints and significant expenses to maintain the appropriate conditions. Hence, effective DNA data storage systems require complete automation in the \u201cwrite-to-store-to-read\u201d cycle of data storage, high DNA data loading, increased DNA stability, and simple sample handling. Previous DNA data storage studies in solution have clearly shown that degradation rates can be precisely predicted, and buffer conditions can be adjusted to obtain remarkable stability at room temperature. Consequently, several approaches to storing digital information on DNA have been proposed with the error-correction model.

Unfortunately for many, this cartilage wears abnormally thin over time and causes physiological problems. If, however, this can be detected before it becomes a serious issue for the patient, then the patient can receive treatments before the painful problem can be fully realized. This technology seeks to aid in just that: assessing the current health and predicting the future health of cartilage in the knees. It works by reading multiple x-rays of the region and then calculating/inspecting the different aspects of the cartilage by using measurements of Joint Space Width (JSW) and observing how it varies. One application would be identification of individuals who are at high risk of undergoing knee replacement in the next 2, 5 or 7 years. Current measurement methods are unreliable as they use minimum joint space width (mJSW) technology to take crude physical measurements (width, length) to make the assessment. This technology is able to detect variance in a greater number of parameters, such as curvature, joint loading, and asymmetry and early trials have shown to be very promising. Applications include assessing current knee health and predicting if surgery will be needed, and how soon. Advantages include being accurate and safe.",

According to the CDC, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States: about one in every four deaths is due to heart disease. Some heart conditions can be treated through replacement of heart valves. However, existing replacement heart valves have limitations. Tissue-based replacement valves, which are taken from other humans or animals, tend not to last long, often requiring another replacement later in life. Mechanical valves, on the other hand, last a long time, but they tend to cause blood clots, so recipients of mechanical replacement valves need to take anticoagulant medicine for the rest of their lives. In recent years, there has been increasing research into the use of synthetic polymers to create heart valves. Many hope that polymeric valves will offer longer life than tissue valves, while reducing the clotting risk experienced with mechanical valves. However, one of the main challenges is in creating a valve that can withstand high stresses over a long period of time. This technology promises to do so through new a design and fabrication process. Applications include heart valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

This type of cancer is especially common in South Asian countries where it is the second most common type of cancer. In those regions, a device like this would be extremely helpful in preventing deaths because the invention is small, compact, portable, and suitable for low resource regions like the ones the disease is most common. Diagnosis of the disease in the early stages is the best way to prevent death. The overall 5 year survival rate of cancers in the oral cavity is about 65-66%.

Functionalization of the C-H bond has evolved as a fundamental principle that underpins both academic and industrial importance in conceptualization and actualization of challenging organic transformations. This ubiquitous but relatively inert bond, if converted to more valuable C-C bond, can greatly accelerate the construction of a wide variety of compounds. This transformation is particularly sought after in fine chemicals and pharmaceutical applications. Incorporation of an aryl substituents at the \u03b1-position of carbonyl compounds is a powerful and attractive method to construct a C(sp2)-C(sp3) bond; and its coupling products, especially \u03b1-aryl cyclic ketones are significant structural motifs that are often encountered in a wide range of biologically interesting natural and pharmaceutical products. A number of classical stoichiometric transformations have been employed for such a key transformation but suffered from complications in scale-up, either due to the need to use highly activated aryl halides as reactants or the use of stoichiometric amount of toxic reagents with harsh reaction conditions, e.g., a high reaction temperature. Significant efforts have been directed towards the development of alternative synthetic routes to this important scaffold. With the advances in metal-catalyzed transformations, palladium-catalyzed \u03b1-arylations of the carbonyl compounds appeared to be the most promising route due to its versatility. However, high cost of the catalyst and additives, as well as requiring a high reaction temperature limits the utility of this approach in the synthesis of \u03b1-aryl carbonyls as building block, especially for pharmaceutical applications. Applications include fine chemical synthesis, synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates or products, and for example, isocoumarin compounds. Advantages include starting from less expensive reactants, a wide variety of non-metal photocatalysts may be used, room temperature synthesis, environmentally friendly, and one pot synthesis.",

    "ip_description": "This invention describes a novel therapeutic approach to treat cardiac muscle arrhythmias and skeletal muscle tremors. Cardiac arrhythmias, such as those that cause atrial fibrillation or sudden cardiac death (SCD), are typically viewed as electrical/conduction abnormalities that drive uncoordinated heartbeats and their downstream health effects. Accordingly, most antiarrhythmic drugs are ion channel blockers that alter electrical conduction or cell calcium signaling pathways. These drugs alter electrical conduction or cell calcium signaling pathways by affecting so called \"excitation-contraction\" coupling where electrical/chemical signaling occurs upstream of, and thus prior to, muscle contraction. The inventors have proposed a novel therapeutic that works downstream of these conventional drug targets: treating cardiac and skeletal contractile units, known as sarcomeres, with myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C). Here, they assert that this approach can modulate intrinsic wavelike oscillations of the sarcomeres, and would therefore be a novel antiarrhythmic and antitremor therapeutic approach. This is based on discoveries that have shifted the notion that cardiac arrhythmias and skeletal muscle tremors nearly always result from dysfunction of the upstream electrical/chemical signaling. Applications: Novel therapeutic for cardiac arrhythmias and skeletal muscle tremors. Advantages: May be more effective for those who have not responded to current/conventional treatments; May be more effective in broadly treating these cardiac dysfunctions.",

    "ip_description": "This invention describes a novel cancer therapy method that induces cell death mechanisms in only cancer cells. The current standard of care for cancer therapy in many cases is chemotherapy. Chemotherapy, like many cancer treatments, causes significant amounts of healthy cells to die in addition to the cancer cells, leading to the well-known toxic side-effects. Additionally, treatments like cytotoxic gene therapy cause cells to express cytotoxic proteins, leading to cell death. This is a very effective tool but has not yet been refined to only allow cancer cells to be impacted. This demonstrates that a significant challenge to cancer treatment is the inability to target cancer-specific cells. The inventors have proposed a novel cytotoxic gene therapy approach in which only cancer cells or cells with specific mutated proteins are induced to express the cytotoxic protein that leads to cell death. Applications include targeted cancer therapy. Advantages include targeted and specific to cancer cells and reduces unwanted toxicity.",

    "ip_number": "UA22-034",
    "published_date": "11/12/2021",
    "ip_description": "This technology involves a combination of a metabolite, 3-hydroxyanthanilic acid (3HAA) with a compound that alters cellular iron homeostasis (e.g. an iron chelator or an iron supplement) that produces synergistic antibiotic interaction. 3HAA sensitizes bacteria to changes in iron availability (both increasing iron media content through supplementation or chelation of iron). Iron is an important element that is necessary for many critical processes in biological systems, including both eukaryotic cells and bacteria. Iron chelators act by binding iron, making it easier for cells and tissues to move and excrete. Combining 3HAA with an iron supplement or an iron chelator creates the dual benefit of killing and inhibiting growth of pathogenic bacteria while repressing hyperinflammatory response. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States alone sees more than 2.8 million cases of antibiotic-resistant infection each year resulting in more than 35,000 deaths. Sepsis, a dysfunctional systemic inflammatory response to infection leading to organ damage and failure, is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) and among the most expensive health conditions treated in the United States. Sepsis survivors experience chronic inflammation, immune suppression, reduced physical function, elevated frailty, and higher mortality rates. The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance has left healthcare workers with a depleted toolbox to combat sepsis. Age is both a primary risk factor for developing sepsis and a major determinant of survival and long-term consequences. There is an urgent and growing need to identify novel antibiotics to combat both the general expansion of antibiotic-resistance bacterial pathogens and sepsis-particularly in elderly patients. To solve this problem, there is a need to develop new types of bacteria-resistant antibiotics. This technology promises to help meet that need, adding one additional tool for medical practitioners to use against antibiotic-resistant infections. In addition, it can be used to reduce inflammation in people with sepsis, which can reduce the chance of organ failure and improve recovery and survivability.",

Because of the design of the probe, it does not require withdrawal and reinsertion to change filters or devices. It is particularly useful in examination and assessment of cancerous tumors in small living animals. The probe is also designed such that it could be implemented through the working channel of standard gastroscopes for human patients. This invention is primarily designed to help improve research and assessment of human cancers in animal models. Historically, examining progression of cancer in animal models for the purposes of cancer research required euthanasia to access the tissue. However, techniques are being adopted that allow live examination, though there is a need for developing efficient endoscopy techniques that are small enough to work with small animals such as mice. This technology provides an all-in-one solution to examine cancerous cells in multiple fluorescence wavelengths and collect cell samples in a small package that works with small animals. In addition to use in cancer research, this invention could be applied to any application where there is limited space and fluorescence imaging is valuable, especially with multiple excitation/emission wavelengths.",

The method may be used to create compounds with multiple, specific chiral centers. Rhamnolipids are a type of chemical notable particularly for their surfactant properties. Unlike most traditional surfactants (such as soaps and detergents), rhamnolipids can be created through an environmentally friendly process, and the resultant chemical is generally less harmful than traditional surfactants. This technology enables production of one specific enantiomer of a given rhamnolipid. Enantiomers have the same chemical formula, but are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, much like a person\u2019s left and right hands. It is valuable to be able to produce specific enantiomers because, despite having the same chemical formula, two enantiomers can have different effects on living organisms. Existing methods of producing enantiomerically pure rhamnolipids involve first creating a 50-50 mixture, and then separating out the desired molecules. This is an expensive and difficult process. This technology addresses this problem, resulting in an environmentally, cost effective, and scalable production process. Applications include fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, and agriculture. Advantages include a simple process, selective production of chiral compounds, environmentally friendly, and capable of being produced at industrial scale.",

Testing in a previously developed Drosophila (fruit fly) model for ALS, these compounds rescued locomotor function. This invention has been shown to be effective in a fly model for rescuing locomotor dysfunction associated with TDP-43. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with currently no curative treatment that causes muscle weakness, disability, and eventually death, with a median survival rate of three to five years.

Heliostats are devices that track the sun over the course of a day, reflecting the sunlight to a stationary target. Large arrays of heliostats, or \u201cheliostat fields,\u201d can be used to concentrate and focus light on one location such as a spot at the top of a tower.

    "ip_description": "The technology involves the design of a hybrid tilt propeller / tilt wing aircraft augmented with Active Flow Control (AFC). This proposed design enhances the aircraft's cruise efficiency and reduces high-power consumption during takeoff, without compromising on hover, vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), and super-short takeoff and landing (SSTOL) capabilities. The control of pitch in hover using an active tail and the tilt wing augmented by AFC not only reduces the power needed for zero run takeoff or landing but it allows the elimination of the cyclic and the edge flight transition to cruise.\n\nThe big advantage of airplanes capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) is that they do not need a runway. Since the tilt rotor concept such as the V-22 evolved from a helicopter that is also used for search and rescue missions, long duration hover is a requirement. However, the thrust needed to hover is an order of magnitude larger than the thrust used by airplanes during cruise, thus a large penalty is paid by requiring an airplane to do both. A tilt-rotor aircraft has a short range and takes relatively small payloads due to download (i.e. the force generated by flow from the rotors that impinge on the upper surface of the wing during hover) take-off (download), and due to its stubby wings (i.e. the low wing span is necessitated in hover when the entire weight of the plane is carried by the rotor shafts). It is also expensive to run because it uses the cyclic capability of the rotor for stability and control during hover and the edge-flow transition to airplane mode.\n\nA hybrid tilt-wing/tilt-rotor airplane concept that is aided by active flow control, can take-off without a runway and climb at very steep angles. It may transport heavy loads or large number of passengers very effectively and cheaply. Its download is reduced by partial tilt and active flow control. Its wingspan is increased by adding an outboard tilted wing, and most importantly, an active gimbled tail that is effective in hover and low forward speeds can eliminate the need for the cyclic motion thus reduce the cost and complexity of operation.\n\nApplications:\n*   Military aircrafts\n*   Civilian aircrafts\n*   Transportation\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Reduces power requirements of takeoff\n*   High cruising speed capabilities\n*   Ability to climb very steep angles\n*   More efficient\n*   Reduces cost\n*   Reduces complexity of operation",

    "ip_description": "The inventors have developed an optical system, laser spot position determination process, and calibration process for deterministically figuring thin mirrors by creating stress inside the glass substrate (or other material transparent to the laser beam wavelength) using an ultrashort pulsed (USP) laser. This process is especially useful for low spatial frequency correction of optical components with high aspect ratio (lateral size to thickness ratio). Current solutions focus on elementary volumes and elements of an optical substrate or wafer. In contrast, this technology allows for an arbitrary deformation map of the entire substrate, determining deviations and deformations of elementary volumes, simplifying the decision-making process, and providing flexibility to optimize laser pulse positions for machine efficiency or process throughput. This technology is an all-in-one solution that allows for the freeform surface height correction across multiple markets that traditional grinding and polishing fail to address. Telescope mirrors, semiconductor optical components, and head-mounted displays are all markets where this device can excel. Applications include all-in-one, thin mirror manufacturing, semiconductors, and head-mounted displays (VR). Advantages include efficiency and accuracy.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a technique to improve the accuracy and performance of autonomous planetary landing vehicles. Measurements from a stabilized seeker implementing a sensor capable of range and closing speed measurements is used to construct a velocity field that, when tracked in six degrees of freedom, will bring the lander to a pinpoint soft landing at the designated landing site, at an upright attitude with negligible rotational velocity. This site can either be illuminated by an optical beacon, or can be selected using terrain hazard avoidance software operating on suitable measurements. A possible hardware configuration for a landing site identified by a landing beacon is a Doppler LIDAR rangefinder with boresight axis aligned with a camera\u2019s optical axis. A possible implementation using software to identify a safe landing site would be a flash LIDAR unit, either fixed in the body frame or gimbaled, where appropriate software would use the flash LIDAR image to select a safe landing site. One aspect of the invention is implementing the guidance and control system using deep reinforcement learning. This method supports multiple divert maneuvers during the descent phase, often required when the classification of a landing site as safe or unsafe changes during the descent as the flash LIDAR resolution increases. Another aspect of the invention is the periodic adjustment of the seeker platform attitude during the descent to keep the landing site centered in the seeker field of view. Technical developments have progressively enabled the increased use of automated landers for use in scientific and exploratory missions to the moon and other planets. Furthermore, the US is planning a human return to the surface of the moon in the coming years. One challenge in descent to the surface of a planet is the reliable and resource-efficient landing in a safe area during descent. For example, there may be obstructions or other conditions that require selection of a different landing site. This technology creates an efficient method of targeting a landing site, improving the performance of the guidance system.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a method of compensating for both look angle dependent radome refraction and rate gyro scale factor errors using deep learning technology, significantly improving the accuracy and effectiveness of a guidance and control system. Look angle dependent radome refraction (which can be modeled as a time varying scale factor error applied to the line of sight direction vector) can create a false indication of target motion, potentially destabilizing a guidance and control system. Similarly, rate gyro scale factor errors create a time-varying bias in the integrated rotational velocity, which is used to estimate the change in vehicle attitude over the trajectory. When this biased change in attitude is then used to stabilize a seeker platform, either computationally in the case of strap down seekers or mechanically in the case of gimballed seekers, imperfect stabilization occurs, again leading to a false indication of target motion. Prior art to compensate for these errors typically estimates the scale factors using a bank of Kalman filters using adaptive models. However, since these models typically adapt only parameters in the ordinary differential equations describing the equations of motion, performance suffers when the structure of the model differs from the actual deployment environment. In contrast, our approach can learn a more expressive representation of the dynamics, and quickly adapt to the actual deployment environment. This technology is a novel method for adaptively correcting sensor scale factor errors using deep learning techniques to predict both the rotational velocity and line of sight scale factor errors, and compensate for these errors using the predictions, improving the performance of a guidance and control system.",

Space around Earth is becoming progressively more congested, especially in the Low Earth Orbit band. According to NASA, there are approximately 23,000 pieces of space junk larger than a softball orbiting Earth, and there are over 100 million pieces a millimeter or larger. These pieces of junk are moving at high speed and can severely damage a satellite or spacecraft they hit. A collision can even cause more debris to form, worsening the problem; in 2009, a defunct spacecraft collided with another craft, resulting in 2,300 new pieces of debris. As more and more satellites are launched into orbit, the risk from space debris increases. Multiple companies are putting \u201cmega constellations\u201d of satellites into orbit, consisting of many thousands of small satellites. When designing these constellations, it is important to place them in orbits that minimize the risk of collisions. This technology helps solve this problem by providing an efficient and reliable means of predicting the chance of collisions with space debris and other satellites during design of a satellite constellation. Applications include satellite constellation design, satellite launch planning, orbital collision prevention, space situational awareness, space traffic management, and space debris risk mitigation.

The polymers described herein are chalcogenide hybrid inorganic organic polymers (CHIPs) with enhanced MWIR and/or LWIR transparency and thermomechanical properties via the inverse vulcanization of elemental sulfur with new organic comonomers. To demonstrate the benefits of deuteration for IR optics, both proteo- and deutero-poly(S-r-DIB) copolymers operating at 3.4 \u00b5m and optical diffraction gratings were prepared from both materials. This is the first demonstration of a functional IR optical element made from a CHIPs polymer that has been deuterated. Optical technologies in the medium wavelength infrared (MWIR, 3-5 \u00b5m) and long wavelength infrared (LWIR spectrum, 7-14 \u00b5m) offer important advantages for high resolution thermal imaging in near, or complete darkness, which has been extensively utilized in the defence sector, but has significant potential in emerging consumer markets and transportation. Current transmissive materials used for IR imaging are based on inorganic materials, such as, germanium (Ge), or chalcogenide glasses (ChG\u2019s). The use of polymeric transmissive materials would offer numerous cost and processing advantages, but historically have suffered from inferior optical properties and low transparency in the LWIR spectrum.

The method here exploits the non-linearity of the quantum computing systems to create logical phibits. The number of phibits is not constrained by the domains of the physical state and the approach here also allows for the definition of the space of states which lie the elastic states of multi phibit systems. Because of the lack of physical constraints, the size of space of states is 2^N where N is the number of phibits, which corresponds to an exponential scaling. This level of exponential scaling is vital to the implementation of quantum computing style algorithms.

The field is also increasingly relevant as it shifts towards real world use due to applications in the pharmaceutical industry and around data security, among other uses. A major hurdle in the use of quantum computing is the expensive requirements of use. Along with physical obstacles such as the ultralow temperature quantum computers run at, they are often not scalable due to physical limitations which do not allow for an increase of qubits. The invention here is a method that will allowed for a scalable multi phi-bit system, which will allow users to avoid many of the expensive requirements of quantum computing systems. By taking advantage of phi-bits, which is a two-level classical analogue of the qubit, the method here is not constrained by physical limitations on the number of phi-bits as the phi-bits are differentiated in the spectral domain. This can allow for the phi-bit states to scale at an exponential level. As a result, this method avoids many of the expensive requirements of quantum systems, including extremely low temperature operation, short computation times, and scalability.",

Oncogenic, or cancer-causing pathways have long been challenging drug targets, especially for complex cancers. One protein complex called eIF4F is key to select oncogenic pathways and drives the progression of some cancers. The eIF4F complex contributes to many of the hallmarks of cancer, such as sustained proliferative signaling, evasion of growth suppression, resistance to programmed cell death, replicative immortality, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. The inventors have shown that by inhibiting the only enzyme in the eIF4F complex (eIF4A) with a novel mechanism of action, they have a validated drug target and have shown toxicities against Burkitt lymphoma cells. This inhibitor could be a potent anti-cancer drug for patients suffering from cancers driven from these oncogenic pathways. Applications: Potent anti-cancer drug. Advantages: Novel mechanisms of action, Demonstrated toxicity against Burkitt lymphoma cells.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a novel technique for monitoring the diffraction efficiency of Volume Holographic Elements (VHOEs) in real time. The technique works by using a shutter or chopper to periodically block one of the exposing beams during the fabrication and measuring the power of the diffracted beam using a power meter. This technique has the potential for a higher accuracy calculation of the diffraction efficiency of VHOEs at a greater simplicity. Volume Holographic Elements (VHOEs) have many applications ranging from display systems, medical devices, and solar energy systems. An important characteristic of VHOEs is diffraction efficiency, which measures how much power is diffracted into a designated direction compared to the power incident onto the diffractive element. Most VHOEs must attain a certain diffraction efficiency; in many designs, the diffraction efficiency should be maximized while in others, the diffraction efficiency is intentionally a lower value. The most common method of controlling the diffraction efficiency is to characterize the holographic material\u2019s diffraction efficiency as a function of exposure energy by fabricating a set of holograms with different exposure energies and measuring the diffraction efficiency of each, with the hologram most closely matching the design constraint used to fabricate the desired VHOE. Another method uses additional equipment and complicated experimental setups to measure the diffraction efficiency by shining light from a separate laser at the construction wavelength from the VHOE. This technique, which works by using a shutter or chopper to periodically block one of the exposing beams during the fabrication and measuring the power of the diffracted beam using a power meter, can calculate the diffraction efficiency at a higher accuracy at a greater simplicity. The calculations are performed in real time, meaning the technique has the potential to account for local variations in the material or laser power that causes the necessary exposure time to fluctuate between samples, which allows for a more precise reading of the diffraction efficiency. This technique is particularly useful for VHOEs used in display systems where precise diffusion efficiency needs to be attained.",

    "published_date": "8/11/2022",
    "ip_description": "This invention comprises a class of tetrazolium-based prochelators for targeting and binding intracellular iron for selective cancer cell antiproliferation or other iron dysregulation. Various analogues within this class of chemistry can be tuned to the redox potential for selective targeting of cancer cell types. Following cellular uptake, the tetrazolium compounds of the present invention undergo reduction to produce metal-binding formazan species that are capable of in vivo binding of various metals. In this approach, the prochelator compound forms an active metal-binding chelator under specific conditions in order to minimize indiscriminate depletion of essential metal ions and potential side effects. The resulting formazan compounds are stable in blood serum and present antiproliferative activities in the 10-30 \u00b5M range, as confirmed against a panel of various cancer cell lines. Iron is an essential element and is the most abundant transition metal in humans. The normal functions of human cells rely on iron due to its vital role in oxygen transport, energy generation, and DNA synthesis. Altered metabolism and homeostasis of transition metal ions (such as iron, copper, and zinc) are associated with several pathological conditions including cancer and neurodegeneration. Thus, metal-binding compounds (chelators) may play important roles in these pathways and may be potential drug candidates for these pathological conditions. Malignant cells have a higher demand for iron to sustain their rapid proliferation rates. As a result, targeting iron metabolism in cancer cells has become a promising strategy in cancer therapy. Iron chelation therapy is a treatment that removes iron in the organism by utilizing a small-molecule scavenger (chelator). This invention uses tetrazolium salts as pro-chelators, namely precursors to iron chelators that can limit intracellular iron availability and cause cell death. The invention relates to methods of making the tetrazolium salts and methods of treatment using the compounds. A prochelation strategy uses disulfide switches to mask the tridentate binding unit of thiosemicarbazone and aroylhydrazone chelators. Upon cellular uptake, the reduction of the disulfide bond releases a thiolate chelator that coordinates iron with high affinity in mammalian cells. The treatment involves a prodrug strategy in which the pro-chelator forms accumulate in cancer cells and transform into the iron-binding chelator forms. Preliminary results have shown moderate anti-proliferative activity in two cancer cell lines.",

A torsion balance measures torque by monitoring the rotation of a test mass suspended from an elastic fiber acting as a torsion spring. To increase the sensitivity of the balance, the size of the fiber can be reduced, resulting in a smaller torsional stiffness and, therefore, larger rotation. This technology merges the concepts behind the original torsion balance with modern-day technology to create a small and ultra-sensitive device for measuring forces and changes in gravity. One of the key insights is that model nanofabrication techniques can be used to dramatically reduce the size of the torsion fiber, yielding higher sensitivity and, at the same time, a smaller form factor. Applications include Gravimetry, Accelerometry, Force sensing, Study of fundamental problems in electromagnetism, and Optomechanics.

It also provides thermal stability, which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio, reduces the error rate, and improves performance. Finally, it can preserve the polarization of received signals to enable applications like free-space quantum key distribution (QKD). The purpose of the VCT is to provide a low-cost, high-performance, and mass-producible space telescope that uses diamond-turned rather than polished optics and a fine-pointing system. The system would enable either quantum communications or high-speed conventional laser communications. It also has applications in both astronomy and Earth remote sensing. Designing CubeSats requires a balance of optical and structural designs with cost and size to maximize performance in extreme environments. Increasing the size (ex. 6U to 12U) may increase the optical performance, but costs may drastically rise in turn. Recent developments in diamond turning have increased the accessibility of aspheric aluminum mirrors, which enables a cost-effective regime of well-corrected nanosatellite telescopes.

Originally created for the purpose of measuring the total volume of a sample of plant matter, it is ideal for measuring the volume of any solid material with complex shapes or many holes and gaps. In agriculture, it is valuable to have methods of measuring the yield of crops in a reliable and repeatable way; this can facilitate precision agriculture practices, where the ideal distribution of nutrients or irrigation are used to maximize crop yields. However, to reliably maximize production, there needs to be a means of accurately and precisely measuring the crop yields.

These compounds target and inhibit the main 3CL protease that is essential to the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and have been shown to be effective against the virus in vitro.\n\nIn March of 2020, SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, became a global pandemic and since then has infected more than 92 million people worldwide, killing nearly 2 million of those people. Even over a year since the first SARS-CoV-2 was reported, there are still very few treatment options available to counteract the negative effects of the viral infection. Although COVID-19 vaccinations are beginning to be widely distributed, the U.S. is still far from reaching herd immunity and many countries around the world still do not have access to the vaccine. In fact, in countries like India, where vaccine supply is low, there have been recent surges in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Therefore, it is imperative to develop effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThis technology provides three potential pharmacological treatment options for COVID-19 that have been demonstrated as effective to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, making this treatment a potential method to stop the spread of COVID-19 and end the global pandemic that has now stretched over one year.\n\nApplications:\n*   Treatment for SARS-CoV-2\n*   3CLPro inhibition\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Novel clinical treatment\n*   Non-invasive treatment option\n*   Non-vaccine treatment for areas that lack vaccine supply\n*   Potential to end global pandemic",

    "ip_description": "This mass spectrometry analysis software and method extends the UniDec Bayesian deconvolution algorithm for application to two-dimensional charge detection-mass data. A 2D plot of m/z versus charge is created from raw data. Smoothing and background subtraction may be used, and deconvolution is applied to remove uncertainty in the charge and the m/z dimension to smooth neighboring charge and mass states. Mass spectrometry (MS) and intact mass analysis are increasingly common in academic and industry research. This has created a demand for more robust approaches to MS analysis. UniDec is one approach. UniDec is a software package based on a Bayesian deconvolution algorithm. The algorithm provides a rapid and robust approach to deconvolving electrospray mass spectra into their corresponding mass and charge components. However, when the UniDec algorithm is applied, several types of artifacts including harmonic charge states and +/- 1 charge state uncertainty may arise depending on the quality and complexity of the data. Removing these artifacts improves the results of the deconvolution process. Applications: Mass spectrometry analysis. Advantages: Improves data quality, Removes deconvolution artifacts.",

    "ip_description": "This technology encompasses the development of novel inhibitors for the main protease, or Mpro, of SARS-CoV-2. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a validated drug target and could be key to the development of antiviral drugs against the virus. The inhibitors proposed in this technology are notable, as they are potent main protease inhibitors with high enzymatic inhibition and antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has brought forth an urgent need for novel drugs and therapeutics to help fight the novel disease. Demand for an effective and safe antiviral drug has been extremely high throughout the pandemic. One possible drug target that various researchers have identified is the main protease- or \u201cMpro\u201d of the SARS-CoV-2. The main protease is key to the viral life cycle, as it allows for the virus to make functional viral proteins and replicate. The majority of current antiviral drugs target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease by modification of a cysteine residue by reactive warhead. This technology proposes and tests small molecule inhibitors based on the superimposed X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with GC-376, telaprevir, and boceprevir that inhibit the same protease. When compared to existing inhibitors such as GC-376, these had more potent antiviral activity and higher selectivity indexes. Applications: An effective SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor drug.

MMP-12 is a protein biomarker associated with neurological inflammatory diseases and has been found here to be correlated to chronic inflammation in the brain following stroke. Therapeutic efficacy may also be assessed using MMP-12 assays.\n\nAccording to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke every year. Also about 610,000 of these are first or new strokes. Furthermore, more than 20% of stroke survivors will have neurodegeneration that will lead to the develop a new dementia within one year of their stroke. Chronic inflammatory response to stroke occurs in the infarcted area of the brain and causes further neurodegeneration in the weeks and months after stroke. This inflammatory response is driven by overwhelmed lipid processing in immune cells processing the lipid rich brain tissue destroyed by the stroke. Conventional treatments focus on imaging or assays immediately following a stroke, but do not include the use of peripheral bio-markers in the days or weeks following to identify patients in which this inflammatory response is occurring or used as a metric for assessing the effectiveness of drugs being used to treat the chronic inflammatory response to stroke.\n\nApplications:\n*   Diagnose extent of secondary inflammation post-stroke that can lead to neurodegeneration\n*   Guide administration of and evaluate effectiveness of therapeutic interventions for chronic inflammation post-stroke\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Prevent neurodegeneration with simple test and intervention\n*   Minimally invasive laboratory test\n*   Strong correlation to chronic brain inflammation\n*   Inexpensive form of diagnostic",

This process to increase supply of NAD in the body is accomplished using small-molecule allosteric NAMPT activators. NAD supplementation has been shown to have benefits towards diseases of aging, metabolic disorders, and stroke. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a coenzyme that is central to metabolism and is essential for fortifying cells\u2019 defense systems and regulating the body\u2019s circadian rhythm. However, an individual's supply of NAD has been shown to decrease with age. With a decrease in NAD in the body, there are many associated health risks, such as neurodegeneration and metabolic dysregulation. Lower NAD levels can also be associated with stroke. For that reason, medications to increase one\u2019s supply of NAD have been linked to many health benefits in the aging process. This product uses a novel pharmacological approach to restoring NAD by utilizing a new agent that activates the enzyme NAMPT, which is responsible for catalyzing the production of NAD. Applications include Anti-aging, Neurodegenerative disease prevention, Metabolic disease treatment, and Supplement cell\u2019s supply of NAD.

    "ip_description": "University of Arizona researchers have discovered a novel approach for treating fungal or yeast infections using a previously unstudied GPCR-like protein, which is integral to the regulation of cell growth in yeast cells. This protein and metabolic pathway is absent in higher-order animals, which provides a novel pathway for drugs to stop the growth of deadly fungal pathogens, such as drug resistant Candida glabrata. This technology may also provide a route to improved control of yeast growth in manufacturing. This invention builds on a previous UArizona discovery of a novel cell signaling pathway/mechanism regulating cell growth and metabolism via TORC1, that is present in simple eukaryotes, such as fungi, yeast, and some parasites, but is not present in higher-order animals. To function correctly, cells set their growth rate based on a wide array of factors, such as nutrient, stress, and hormone signals. In eukaryotes, this fine-tuned control depends, in a large part, on a single, highly-conserved, signaling hub called the Target of Rapamycin kinase Complex I (TORC1). In the presence of pro-growth hormones and abundant nutrients, TORC1 drives growth by activating protein, ribosome, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis. In contrast, when nutrient or hormone levels drop, TORC1 is repressed, causing cells to switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism, and eventually enter a quiescent state. Applications include a solution to address drug resistant fungal infections, treatment to slow or stop the growth of fungal infections, and control the growth/metabolism of yeast in an industrial setting. Advantages include a selective mode of action for controlling yeast or fungal growth and a novel approach to address drug resistant fungal infection.",

This ion flotation technique is a simple, cost-effective, green method to extract rare earth elements from aqueous solutions in an effort to keep the public and environment safe and compliant with EPA standards. In the western half of the United States especially, there are approximately 4,200 legacy mining sites that have been used in the past to mine for uranium. However, between 1980 and 2000 the price for uranium dropped and many of these mining sites were left abandoned. Many of these abandoned mines were left with unlined leach pads and much of the uranium seeped back into the groundwater. The issue now is not only compliance with EPA standards and regulations, but the health of the public who interact daily with groundwater in those areas. Currently, there are many techniques for removing uranium from aqueous solutions including, but not limited to, membrane filtration methods, anion exchange, or the application of coagulation processes. The important questions asked when addressing the many different techniques are questions of scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness. This ion flotation technology checks all three boxes in a way that would potentially allow communities and industrial waste sites to use a simple, inexpensive technique for uranium removal from aqueous solutions. Applications include wastewater treatment and groundwater remediation.

Not only do blue light suppressing glasses decrease some of the stress on an individuals\u2019 eyes, but the decrease in blue light staves off another side effect of blue light consumption: a decrease in melatonin production. This invention performs the opposite function, increasing levels of blue light in the morning thereby staving off melatonin production, strengthening the circadian system, and leading to stronger, healthier circadian rhythms. The idea that an individual\u2019s mood and health are related to the amount of light exposure is not a new one; however, the medical industry\u2019s understanding of its various wavelengths and uses has grown, and continues to grow in recent years. In the past few decades especially, the industrialized world continues to try and squeeze more and more productivity out of a 24 hour period. Perhaps even more troubling is the increase in sleep disorders which, in some cases, are up 64% from 2013 to 2016.

This alteration makes melatonin production more difficult during the night/evening. So far, new products, research, and ideas tend to favor blocking blue light at night to increase melatonin production. However, the circadian rhythm is more affected at all times during the day which would lead to the conclusion that the few hours just after waking up are just as important as those few hours before going to sleep.",

    "ip_description": "This invention uses pink lenses as an efficient way to block blue light while appealing to younger users and those who have a difficult time wearing the more visually cumbersome orange or red lenses. The use of blue light blocking glasses have recently become more popular for the general public because an increasing number of individuals spend a majority of their day looking at screens. The most effective lenses at blocking blue light\u2014red and orange lenses\u2014are difficult to wear and are not aesthetically appealing to younger users. Currently, most blue light blocking technology in glasses is manifest in four different colors: clear (to the extent clear is a color), yellow, orange, and red\u2014the darker the color, the greater the ability of the lenses to block blue light. Orange and red are worn by users to promote healthy sleep habits. This is especially important because blue light suppresses the generation of melatonin. Therefore, the logic goes, the use of strong blue light suppression glasses allows the user two benefits: (1) Continuing use of devices that may be necessary for work or entertainment; and (2) Generating melatonin at normal levels and allowing for normal sleep patterns. Furthermore, blue light puts a great strain on the eyes of those who constantly look at blue light, which is no small percentage of the population. Applications: Bolstering circadian rhythm, Blocking excessive blue light. Advantages: Stylish, More effective than clear lenses.",

    "ip_description": "This invention describes a method by which light sensitivity in the retina can be restored using gold nanoparticles after the photoreceptors have been degraded or damaged. Traditional treatment for visual impairment can differ based on the cause of the impairment, but often includes eyeglasses, contact lenses, Lasik surgery, or simple quality of life (QOL) aids such as service dogs or canes. In many cases, visual impairment or blindness is not fixed or repaired, but mitigated as long as possible. This has left a large demand for some technology or therapeutic that can actually help patients suffering from visual impairment to restore vision or light sensitivity. In this technology, the inventors propose a method that utilizes gold nanoparticles to restore light sensitivity in the retina following photoreceptor damage or degradation. These gold nanoparticles are conjugated to specific cellular targets to initiate action potentials and restore light sensitivity. Applications: Treatment of visual impairment. Advantages: Restores light sensitivity, Offers better alternative to rescue vision than current treatments.",

Many RJ program formats exist such as sharing circles, victim\u2013offender dialogue, victim impact panels, community reparation boards, circles of support, sentencing circles, and conferencing. Scholarly discourse on RJ for sexual assault has been hindered by lack of empirical data and is predominately conceptual and dialectic. Just as there are few conferencing programs designed for sexual assault, published evaluations are scarce. RESTORE was a demonstration project and represents what was possible as a pioneering effort in its setting and with available resources.

Oral administration and targeted delivery of pro-drugs or other payloads, such as nutritional supplements, bonded to a carbohydrate-based molecular scaffold travel to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where the pro-drug is released directly in the GI tract by enzymes naturally present. This technology provides a means of delivery of GI therapies for a number of indications without requiring metabolism through the liver or other systemic exposure.\n\nAs one example of GI disease, colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. Patients with colorectal cancer often receive chemotherapy as a primary treatment or as a pre/post-surgery treatment for their cancer. One of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of colorectal cancer is 5-Fluorouracil. 5-Fluorouracil is used due to its high effectiveness rates against colorectal cancer. Current oral administrations of pro-drugs for 5-Fluorouracil, capecitabine and tegafur, must be metabolized in the liver before 5-FU can be released, thus, the drug is not concentrated in the colon, but rather is systematically available. This leads to adverse effects which might be avoided if 5-FU was specifically released in the colon and remained concentrated there. Therefore, there is a need for a method that allows release of 5-FU or other active pharmaceutical ingredients in the colon.\n\nApplications:\n*   Colorectal cancer treatment\n*   Stomach cancer treatment\n*   Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment\n*   Infectious diarrhea treatment\n*   Infectious bacterial treatment\n*   Intestinal bacterial overgrowth treatment\n*   Nutritional supplement delivery\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Targeted rather than systemic delivery\n*   Reduces systemic exposure\n*   Reduces off-target effects",

The separation media comprises a selective surface modifier, with tunable properties, incorporated on an inexpensive material, which may be a cellulose sponge, fiber, or powder. \n\nBackground:  Perfluorinated organics are very stable manmade chemicals that have properties that allow them to repel both water and oil. PFAS are often referred to as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not readily breakdown in the environment and are water soluble. PFAS have been found to accumulate into bodies of humans and animals. Scientists are still learning about the health effects of exposures to PFAS. PFAS are very expensive to remove from water supplies or aquifers with conventional water treatment due to their low concentrations in water and their high hydrophilicity.

    "ip_description": "Entanglement Assisted Communication (EACOMM) and quantum computing is the future for many different industries. The unique capabilities of being able to calculate some superposition of atoms between 0 and 1 is a huge asset for complex computing. While the channel capacity for EACOMM has been theoretically demonstrated, optimal quantum receivers have yet to be determined. In order to realize the optimal efficiency and capability of EACOMM, quantum receivers must advance in tandem with the other hardware involved in EACOMM. This technology is a step in realizing the capability of EACOMM and does so with a lower-cost solution. The technology involves the use of several low-complexity quantum receivers employing the optical parametric amplifier as a basic building block. Entanglement Assisted Communications (EACOMM) relies on quantum entanglement which is the heart of quantum physics. EACOMM takes advantage of the fact that quantum physics laws describes how atoms are able to take on some superposition between 0 and 1 instead of the simple binary in communication over the internet today. This principle of superposition allows for the performance of far more complex calculations which is extremely useful in many different areas. The superposition allows for secure transfer of information through quantum key distribution (QKD). Because each particle is some fraction between 0 and 1, two communication systems are able to send information through fiber optic cables and through a process known as key sifting, ensure that they have the same key. This process makes the transmission of information practically impossible to hack. All of these stand as theoretical capabilities of EACOMM and are beginning to become reality with several EACOMM applications beginning to unfold in real-time. However, the hardware needs to continually improve in order to achieve the theoretical capabilities of the theoretical channel capacity of this technology. These new quantum receivers enhance the actual capabilities of quantum communications.",

The documentary describes methods of jaguar detection motion cameras, scat sampling, and hair sampling. The camera tracking method for jaguars and ocelots uses cameras deployed at 140 sites over 16 mountain ranges, and the success of this method makes it a model for other research programs tracking large mammals. Given the large number of cameras and large detection area, collaboration with local residents and multiple government agencies is vital. This documentary serves to educate both the general public and residents with affected land about the program, its impact, and its importance. In Southern Arizona over the last 15 years, solitary male jaguars\u2014typically one at any given time\u2014have migrated from Northern Mexico into Southern Arizona and New Mexico. Controversial lawsuits and federal actions for habitat designation for this endangered species has raised concerns in the ranching community that operates on\u2014and in some cases owns\u2014the land within these boundaries. Although habitat designation fuels the perception that the ranching livelihood is under threat, it\u2019s unlikely that the designation in itself will have any impact on the ranching operations within jaguar critical habitat. Instead, the protection of these large, unfragmented open spaces is mutually critical for both the jaguar and the ranchers. The National Park Service describes different wildlife monitoring programs, such as at Point Reyes National Seashore. In Canada, wildlife sensor and alert systems have been set up to reduce the number of collisions with large animals such as moose. Google has funded the Wildlife Crime Technology Project to combat poaching using an umbrella of technology tools.

The enzyme was engineered to target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and become expressed using an embryo-specific promoter in the transgenic maize. It can be used in combination with an RNAi suppression method, HIGS, to protect maize during pre-harvest conditions. It is estimated that 25% of the world\u2019s crops are contaminated with a mycotoxin, a toxin produced by fungal sources. Aflatoxins are one class of mycotoxins that have two particularly toxic strains that are often found in maize, peanuts, cotton, and tree nuts. When ingested through the consumption of these crops, aflatoxin has been shown to be a Group 1 carcinogen for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer. HCC is the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Many countries restrict the levels of aflatoxins allowed in food, which results in millions of crops being disposed of each year. Most prior methods to reduce the prevalence of aflatoxins in crops have been insufficient and still result in the loss of many crops. Because aflatoxin contaminates crops in both pre-harvest and post-harvest storage, it is essential to have a method that is capable of working under both conditions. This method introduces a bioengineered aflatoxin-degrading enzyme that has the capability to prevent contamination in both conditions when combined with an RNAi suppression method in post-harvest. This method provides the potential to significantly impact food security and safety globally in any crop susceptible to mycotoxins.",

This discovery and method can focus the direction of research and understanding to create the optimal topography for wound healing and other tissue engineering applications.\n\nTissue replacement and repair are some of the important goals of tissue engineering. Much like any other form of rebuilding, scaffolding needs to be built to support the proliferation and adhesion of cells and, in this case, smooth muscle cells. Electrospinning is a widely recognized process for the replication of tissue matrix composition, topography, and other mechanical properties of natural tissue stroma. The process of electrospinning can be done with biologic or synthetic materials with the purpose of the electrospun scaffolds to provide a base for cellular adhesion which could facilitate faster wound healing.\n\nThis study focused on differences in cellular adhesion and retention in different topographies generated on a 2D plate. To what degree does the topography affect how cells interact with the scaffolding? That question may lead to important considerations for large-scale applications where the considerations of quick proliferation and widespread cell adhesion would directly affect the recovery of a medical procedure.",

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are classes of hematologic cancers that often progress into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These conditions are especially troubling, as there are typically no symptoms before advanced progression. Additionally, there are currently no commonplace indicators or predictors of risk of development or progression. Phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis protein, or PIGN, has been found here to be a significant biomarker and indicator of the development or progression of hematological neoplasias and AML. The inventors describe a method for determining prognosis based on PIGN and related gene products, which can then be used to determine patient care. Applications include early detection for hematological neoplasias, evaluating risk for AML, and assisting in determining care or therapeutics needed for patients.

To get a \u201creal\u201d looking model, the light scattering on the model needs to be simulated correctly to get a realistic model. The polarimetry of objects is measured in the lab, fit to a model, and this model is used to simulate the polarized light scattering of objects in computer simulations. This new model can generalize two unpolarized, partially polarized, or fully polarized scattering through 4 fully polarized terms. Since these terms are fully polarized, the technology does not require least-squares fitting. The growth of virtual-reality (VR) and augmented-reality is becoming increasingly used in video games and as training tools. This increase in use is driving the need for innovations that make these technologies cheaper, faster, and more robust. Models for polarized light scattering are of interest to computer vision, atmospheric sciences, stray light analysis, and medicine. The robustness of current polarized light scattering models is insufficient for generalization to a diverse set of materials. Even relatively simple variations in surface texture defy the constraints of a single model. Applications include augmented reality / virtual reality, computer vision, and medical education.

    "ip_description": "There are two cysteine proteases that are encoded by SARS-CoV-2, the main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). Both of these proteases have been shown to be essential in viral replication and are validated antiviral drug targets. PLpro cleaves the viral SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein at three sites. In addition, it modulates host immune response by cleaving the ubiquitin and ISG modifications from host proteins. This technology identified several novel compounds that are effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Because of its role in viral replication and immune modulating, inhibition of PLpro is expected to provide therapeutic benefits in patients that are infected with SARS-CoV-2. As of February 1, 2021, there have been over 27 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States and nearly half a million deaths related to the virus. Worldwide there have been over 100 million cases of COVID-19, with over 2.2 million dead from the virus. The virus also has been damaging to the global economy as well as the U.S. economy. Despite the devastation caused by the virus, there are still very few FDA-approved treatments for those who become infected with the virus. In late 2020, two vaccines were approved for emergency use to be administered to prevent the disease; however, a very small percentage of individuals have been able to receive that vaccine. Therefore, it is essential that more treatment options become available for those that become ill with COVID-19. This technology introduces novel, highly-potent PLpro inhibitory compounds that will be able to be used to stop the viral replication of COVID-19. This can be used retroactively to slow the spread of the disease in individuals who have already become infected with COVID-19. PLpro inhibitors have also been shown to be useful antivirals for other human coronaviruses, giving this technology potential to be used to develop treatments for future infectious diseases that resemble COVID-19.",

The method of the invention is particularly useful in producing an alpha-aryl substituted cyclic ketone from an un-activated cyclic ketone compound. This is vast improvement to the synthesis of building blocks to many different fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. This allows companies to perform the alpha arylation at room temperature, in the absence of expensive and toxic metals, and with commonly available white or green light.\n\nThe development of practical methods for the arylation of carbonyl compounds is, and has long been, a challenge in organic synthesis. Typically, this has been done through catalysis using expensive metals, such as palladium, and with temperatures exceeding 130\u00b0C or 266\u00b0F. All of this contributes to the difficulty of manufacturing commercial important intermediates for fine chemicals or pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals especially face difficulty in manufacturing because of heavy regulation regarding the use of heavy metals in the manufacturing process.\n\nFor example, ketamine is one of the largest breakthroughs in severe depression in years when it was developed. Currently the process of synthesizing ketamine is an eight-step process that requires metal complexes and toxic reagents. With this synthesizing technique, Ketamine could be synthesized in four steps without any of the expensive metals or toxic reagents. Furthermore, the four steps now require much lower temperatures, around room temperature, and photosynthesizing agents instead of heavy metals.\n\nApplications:\n\n* Pharmaceutical chemical synthesis\n* Fine Chemicals production\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* Direct photoredox synthetic approach for alpha-carbonyl arylation from unactivated cyclic ketones\n* Photocatatalyst effective at room temperature under green light\n* Wide functional group tolerance\n* Inexpensive precursors\n* High yields\n* Fewer synthetic steps",

The idea essentially is to provide the students with an online learning experience by taking off-the-shelf items and repurposing TVs with HDMI capabilities and external drives that give students the content, books, and courses they need to be successful. The reactionary public policy stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic has left families, students, teachers, and administrators to wonder how they can deliver an education to everyone within their territorial limits.

What do we do with the vast number of people who do not have access to either technology or consistent internet access? Those individuals are currently being left behind and fault may be attributed to parents or guardians, but the young students are those who are not receiving an education.

    "ip_description": "Though perhaps not often thought of first, the circadian system in the human body is essential to important daily and cyclical bodily functions including: hormone release, temperature control, eating habits, mood, sleep, etc. Those circadian responses in the human body are primarily triggered by light exposure. There is a body of research surrounding mammalian exposure to light pulses and the effects of those light pulses on the circadian rhythm. This technology is an addition to the body of research and shows the utility of intermittent light administration on the order of nanoseconds and microseconds rather than minutes or hours. The idea is to positively affect the circadian rhythm of an individual without consistent medication or extreme life changes. There are many diseases and mental health issues that can be affected by the shifting of the circadian rhythm and this technology is the first step in showing this can be an effective combatant of various disease states. The circadian system influences the date and time perceptions of the human body and, with that information, the human body responds accordingly. Understanding and influencing the circadian timing allows for simple things like improving moods to changing the health and well-being of an individual suffering from chronic ailments. Traditionally, circadian timing has been influenced with elongated exposure to bright synthetic light to perhaps shift the circadian system. While it has been established that elongated light stimulation can, and does, shift circadian timing, that elongated timeline is not efficient nor is it practical for many individuals wishing to influence their circadian system in hopes of positive effects. However, with the hopes that much faster exposures to light would allow the subject to feel the benefits of shifting their circadian timing, the very real possibility of affecting that shift with light begins to take shape. This technology and study seeks to do just that. Practically influence the human circadian system with only light and with light exposure on the scale of microseconds and nanoseconds rather than hours.",

    "ip_description": "Animal studies have always been a large part of scientific and medical discoveries both for the animals being studied and for eventual human application. Plethysmography, studying the changes in the volume of a body or organ, is a critical part of those studies. Here specifically is the study of respiration endpoints in mice and rats given different environmental conditions including the introduction of aerosolized medication. Typically, there are two ways mice and rats have been studied: conscious or unconscious. Administering anesthesia is tricky and it does not accurately reflect the conscious reactions sometimes sought after in the research. However, conscious plethysmography offers its own set of problems. Scientists are trying to record accurate data while simultaneously keeping the mice under as little stress possible. Typically, head-out chambers require restraints to keep the mice in place. There is a problem particularly with head-out plethysmographs in losing pressure from leaks in those restraints. This invention introduces an air-fillable balloon that tightens safely and securely around the rodent\u2019s neck. The balloon seals the container, preventing air leaks and maintaining accurate pressure in the plethysmography chamber ensuring thousands of accurate breath measurements. Conscious, restrained plethysmography during research on rodents can be difficult to achieve accurate results in terms of keeping accurate pressure, temperature, and humidity in the chamber or chambers. Much of that has to do with the restraint on the rodent\u2019s head. While most head-out chambers offer a few different sizes, each mouse head is shaped slightly differently which just means that there are some gaps for air to escape. This technology allows one to measure the respiratory rate, lung capacity, etc. for any sized rodent by sealing the chamber encapsulating the rodent\u2019s abdomen away from the rodent\u2019s head. This simple solution allows for more flexibility in experimental design, less stress on the rodent yielding more accurate results, and eliminating the need for additional sensors and cumbersome solutions to the pressure, temperature, and air leak.",

The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a validated drug target and could be key to the development of more antiviral drugs against the virus. The inhibitors proposed in this technology are notable, as they are non-covalent inhibitors with high enzymatic inhibition and antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has brought forth an urgent need for novel drugs and therapeutics to help fight the novel disease. Demand for an effective and safe antiviral drug has been extremely high throughout the pandemic. One possible drug target that various researchers have identified is the main protease or \u201cMpro\u201d of the SARS-CoV-2. The main protease is key to the viral life-cycle, as it allows for the virus to make functional viral proteins. The majority of current antiviral drugs target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease by covalent modification of a cysteine residue by reactive warhead. This technology proposes and tests two inhibitors that inhibit the same protease, but do so non-covalently. Even when compared to another existing non-covalent inhibitor, the two compounds proposed by this technology showed increased enzymatic inhibition, stronger affinity, and significant antiviral ability in cell culture. Applications: An effective SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor drug.

One of the many challenges to using this method of power generation is channeling the solar energy in the most efficient way at all times of the day. This has required practitioners, including those at the University of Arizona, to create heliostats that can customize their shape to maximize solar radiation collection.\n\nSolar power is difficult to harness consistently for a multitude of reasons, one of which is a lack of sunlight. Because the sun does not shine everywhere, it is imperative to create solar fields in places where the sun shines consistently and then maximize the efficiency when the sun is shining. Because of that, every efficiency increase brings the technology one step closer to competing with fossil fuels to power communities the world over.",

    "published_date": "1/11/2021",
    "ip_description": "Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease (AHPND) also known as Early Mortality Syndrome (EMS) is one of the most devastating diseases for shrimp farming in the last decade. Since its discovery in 2009, AHPND caused $2.56 billion dollars worth of losses in Vietnam, $11.6 billion in Thailand, and significant losses worldwide as the disease increases its geographic reach. This technology is part of the solution to the AHPND problem plaguing the shrimp market. The idea is giving the shrimp an ability to defend against the disease by using a feed that includes a protein additive. This protein attaches to the toxin produced by bacteria causing AHPND, thus functionally blocking the toxins from affecting the shrimp. Demand for shrimp the world over has increased in recent years for a number of reasons. These include but are not limited to: An increase in the middle class income in developing countries, An increase in seafood consumption, The continuing ease with which products are shipped around the world. Because demand for shrimp has increased, the need for industrial shrimp farming has also increased to meet that demand. However, just like any other farming practice, the close proximity and intensive farming with high stocking density exacerbates disease problems that otherwise may not be found in nature. Those diseases are the number one challenge in the shrimp industry and account for billions of dollars worth of losses every year. Each pathogen requires three things: (1) a host; (2) an optimum environment (temperature, proximity etc.); and (3) pathogen present in the water or other organism. Usually, farmers try to disconnect the third prong from the other two. One of the best ways is to give the shrimp some kind of protection from specific pathogens or diseases. One major way to accomplish this is to provide shrimp, from the beginning, feed and feed additives that prevent the pathogen from finding a suitable host in the farm. This research produced the end product designed to provide that defense to shrimp from AHPND.",

Tissue engineering technologies are a promising method for treating cardiovascular disease; however, currently available methods that use synthetic polymers to produce tissue scaffolds lack efficacy in vivo and can cause debilitating side effects due to their biological incompatibility. This technology overcomes the issues with currently available conventional polymers for treating cardiovascular disease by using recombinant proteins that reduce the organizational defects caused by polymer networks. Another issue with currently available technologies used for tissue engineering methods is the lack of stability and specificity in current cross-linkers for scaffold production.

Virus-specific antibody-conjugated fluorescent particles and a biological fluid sample (saliva, mouth gargle, etc.) from the patient are added onto a paper microfluidic chip, causing target antigens to flow through the chip and inducing particle to aggregate. The microfluidic chip is then analyzed using the smartphone-based fluorescence microscope, which can count the aggregated particles one-by-one and quantify the amount of virus in the sample with the extreme limit of detection, down to a single copy. This process occurs rapidly, within minutes, allowing the user to assess their treatment plan quickly after administration of the test. The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, became a global pandemic in early March 2020. Worldwide, the virus has since killed nearly 1.5 million people and infected 64 million more. One of the key aspects to controlling the spread of the virus is to detect it early through testing and tracing infected individuals. Currently, there are not many diagnostic tests for COVID-19 that rapidly give an individual result. The most commonly available test is an RT-PCR test, results of which usually are not available for a couple of days. Rapid antigen tests are also available, however, its limit of detection and accuracy are not as good as RT-PCR. This test resolves the issue of forcing a suspected infectious individual to quarantine and wait days for their test results while providing extreme limit of detection by providing results within minutes of the administration of the test. Not only does this rapid detection technology allow the individual to assess their treatment needs more quickly, but it also is precise and conveniently available through a user\u2019s smartphone technology.

This trend has been growing in manufacturing, home safety, and building automation. One of the major realities faced by IoT systems is an overwhelming amount of data coming from sensors. Not only that, but the cost of having all sensors constantly monitoring on all frequencies is very high. This technology is a step toward a cost-effective solution. The general idea in this invention is a framework for predicting unreported signals by estimating the correlation of those signals with historic and concurrent reported frequencies. Furthermore, the method uses sensors\u2019 historical data in different scenarios coupled with a correlative factor and a gaussian distribution to predict other unreported frequencies. This enhances sensors\u2019 adaptability into differing environmental conditions. The Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and the data collected from there has increased dramatically over the past several years. And, while the number of sensors increase, the accuracy and versatility of sensor readings become more important. One of the problems associated with data collection accuracy is that processing large amounts of data is costly. And basic sensors may find it difficult to report wide ranges of frequencies which may therefore distort the reported data. To more accurately assess the frequency data given from these sensors, this technology offers a way of predicting a more wholistic understanding of the data reported from IoT sensors from either unreported low or higher frequencies. This provides a way for those sensors to be more versatile and accurate. Applications: All types of IoT sensors, Software analysis of the sensor data.

This algorithm was programmed and tested in calculations of hydrogen deuteride (HD) in a stationary magnetic field. The splitting of the HD singlet and triplet energy levels were studied. This advancement involves using explicitly correlated Gaussian functions with shifted centers to represent the wave function dependent on the spatial coordination of the electrons and the nuclei. The work involved high-accuracy calculations performed with the use of supercomputers. Computer simulation to rationalize and predict the behavior and course of atoms and molecules in chemical and materials systems has been of critical importance in the chemical and allied industries for several decades. The advent of supercomputers and parallel processing has opened the door further for accurate predictions of chemical behavior which could previously only been usefully interrogated with empirical methods. In the last decade, various research groups have developed algorithms for predicting the structure and behavior at the atomic and molecular level taking into account quantum effects of atomic systems and states of electrons. Applications include atomic transition state behavior predictions, catalyst design, electronic materials design, biotech molecular design, quantum logic spectroscopy and design, and research in and design for high magnetic fields.

    "ip_description": "This technology uses deep neural networks to examine the power states of a device performing cryptographic operations and determine the underlying encryption key with high accuracy across varying processor architectures. Embedded systems are among devices often the most vulnerable to attacks on their security. They are often used in public or in distributed environments where it becomes a challenge to prevent physical tampering. The Internet of Things has resulted in a dramatic increase in the prevalence embedded devices, many of which process sensitive information. And the rapid technological developments in the defense industry demand high levels of security for technologies used in the field. One type of security threat particularly important to embedded devices are side-channel attacks. Side-channel attacks use information about a system, such as power states, to infer other, more valuable information. While the concept of side channel attacks has existed since the turn of the millennium, recent developments in machine learning technology, as illustrated in a 2016 article, have dramatically improved the feasibility of such attacks. This technology builds upon breakthroughs in side channel attack technology to create an attack method that can be used against devices with varying processor architectures, without significantly sacrificing accuracy. Other side channel attack methods include waveform matching with Fourier analysis to improve correlation accuracy of power states and keys, targeting processor branch instructions, measuring keyboard acoustics for password detection, and measuring interrupt latency for coarse-grained information in even the most secure Intel commodity processors. In addition to its potential offensive applications such as cyber warfare, it provides a valuable method of testing and verifying the security of embedded systems and their resistance to side channel attacks. For example, a research group detected cache-based side-channel attacks through identifying abnormal cache behaviors associated with those attacks. Side channel attack patents filed in the US in the past 5 years tend to concern defensive mechanisms to attacks (i.e. Intent patent US20190042479 A1 filed in 2018).",

The increased ability of people to travel all over the United States and the world is a trend that continues to rise. While hotels provide a number of amenities for guest comfort (i.e. WIFI, flat screens, entertainment etc.) is there a way to understand how well guests sleep in a given hotel? All of the other comforts are important, but customers are usually there to sleep. Is there a way to accurately track the sleep quality of a given hotel\u2019s guests? This study is the first step to establishing a uniform standard for tracking sleep satisfaction and how sleep quality affects the overall customer satisfaction in a given hotel. This research offers a unique perspective to the existing literature because it shows a strong correlation between the rating of a good night\u2019s sleep and the overall hotel experience. A number of factors contribute to the correlation. The research provides an incentive perspective for hotels because often it seems that the rate of return on increasing mattress quality, for example, is very low. However, this study would suggest that specifically modifying a few variables will allow an increase in overall hotel satisfaction without needlessly spending money. As established earlier, people travel more both for business and pleasure. And, in an era of online reviews, consumer sleep quality could be a million-dollar question for hotel owners. An easy way to increase satisfaction is to lower cost, increase room size, upgrade the mattress quality etc., but this is a business. Hotels, like any other industry are looking for the best possible return on investment. Many websites and apps like Yelp, review hotels and allow consumers to do the same. But these ratings are somewhat arbitrary to hotel administrators. What is it that makes the overall satisfaction three stars instead of five? Are there simple measures to implement that would change the overall rating? This study suggests hotels can discern and make those changes.",

Of those health problems, hypertension is one of the leading causes of heart complications and death. Approximately 30 million people in the United States currently take blood pressure medication to mitigate the risks of hypertension. Blood pressure medication staves off the long term effects of high blood pressure over years. However, individuals must take this medication regularly and in specified windows. If a time window is missed, individuals may have too much or too little of the medication in their systems for the medication to be effective. This technology is the first step in a customizable application to remind the user to take their medication and to educate the user on what to do if there is a missed time window. Furthermore, this invention gives the input of interviewed individuals over 65 to understand the issues encountered when trying to regularly take medication. With the increase in smartphone usage across age demographics, the time is now to create a customized solution using smartphones to the benefit of those consistently taking medication. There are a few trends that allow the success of this technology. One is the increasing average age in the United States and the need for regularly taken medications. The other trend is an increase in the number of individuals over 60 who regularly carry smartphones, which is now over 40%. With both of these trends happening on parallel timelines, it is high time for an app that allows people in this demographic to get educated about the medication they take. And, perhaps most importantly, if a time window was missed for taking specific medications, the app can let the individual know if it is safe to take their medication at that point. Even with the advances in technology, the available medication reminders are either on some sort of clock or an smartphone timer. In addition, there are medication dispensers that help people remember when to take their medication based on the last time the container was opened. With the advent of all of this new technology however, there needs to be an educational aspect to taking medication and allowing individuals to take control of their own healthcare.

    "ip_description": "A lack of information is perhaps the crux of every problem involving public policy. In 2020, COVID-19 emphasizes the lack of data and information with which public figures attempt to make decisions. Ideally, public policy, including policy for large institutions, would be made with a crystal ball and 100% certainty of the effects of the policy. Because this is impossible, simulations try to iterate and propagate key assumptions over time. This invention provides policy makers a novel simulation based on a student-mobility model and a disease propagation in tandem. Student mobility meaning a GIS map overlaid with daily student schedules including classrooms, buildings, dorms, and so on, while the disease propagation model shows student health, shedding rate of the disease, number of infected students in various locations, probabilities of disease transmissions (airborne, droplet, etc.). The invention will allow administrators to get some insight into the impact of policy decisions. Computer models are used in applications like tensile-strength modeling of a steel beam to fluid modeling of biohazardous material in a given scenario. All of these computer models are run for the same reason: it is too expensive to run the experiment physically. This is true for COVID-19 and other diseases; the human cost and organizational cost is too expensive. It is imperative that administrators and policy makers are not ignorant to the effects of their policy decisions, nor should they be paralyzed because the effects of that paralysis may be equally deadly. Accurate models give those policy makers a reasonable glimpse of potential policy outcomes. There is a large need for these models in many areas and, in 2020, this could be the difference between locking down forever and changing input parameters to get people back where they need to be. While there are many models considering crowd control or disease transmission, this model integrates all of the data available to the university to provide a holistic presentation of campus reactions to policy changes.",

    "ip_description": "A rise in melanoma cases across the world and a decline in the number of dermatological specialists characterizes the outlook of global professional skin care. General practitioners can look for clues before referring patients to a specialist; and, if they have the tools, they can take high-quality diagnostic tests for further specialist monitoring. However, specialized equipment is expensive and unrealistic for family practices to carry. This invention is a low-cost, high-quality solution to the general problem. It allows general practitioners to analyze questionable skin areas to check for abnormalities, discoloration, lack of cell-uniformity, etc. Furthermore, the accessibility of the technology could expand to encompass the general public. This technology is an inexpensive, effective dermascope attachment to the smartphone that allows the user to map out dermal lesions using polarized white light imaging (PWLI) and polarized multispectral imaging (PMSI). Increasing both accuracy and accessibility will increase the number of early diagnoses and decrease the number of people who die from skin cancer every year. In the United States, between 17,000 and 18,000 people die from skin cancer every year and over 64,000 in the world. Early detection is a key contributor to the 5-year survival rate in individuals diagnosed with skin cancer. Because early-detection can make all the difference, companies have been trying to educate the public about the dangers of skin cancer, and make early-detection as easy as possible. Several phone apps allow individuals to send pictures to specialists to analyze. However, the information is often not enough for a diagnosis. In addition, there are many people in the United States and around the world who don\u2019t have access to a specialist. General practitioners would be more successful at diagnosing malignant forms of cancer with the right tools. Unfortunately, the right tools are often too expensive and unrealistic for a local clinic to have on-hand. This invention changes the way professionals collect information on suspicious areas. Pew research found that 81% of Americans have smartphones and that number is increasing rapidly. So, while it is unrealistic to expect general practitioners to have specialized skin cancer screening equipment, it would be realistic to expect most people to have smart phones. There are many health screening apps and this dermascope attachment to any cell phone would vastly improve the data sent to doctors from patients around the world.",

    "ip_description": "\u201cThe unprecedented circumstances surrounding COVID-19\u201d was the pervasive buzz phrase of 2020 and post-COVID re-entry in 2021. More than ever before, businesses, universities, congregations, and communities are seeking ways to allay people\u2019s fears, anxieties, and stress as they re-enter their workplaces and communities and come back to something that resembles normalcy. This invention provides people the information they need to reduce their stress as they re-enter. This is done by providing near real-time and real place information about factors that increase different types of perceived risks (e.g. potential for violence, PP usage, crowding, pinch-points, building occupancy and ventilation), mapping out potential areas of risk, and providing users potential routes around those areas. This information and dashboard can be applied to many campus-like settings, such as university campuses, shopping malls, office and industrial parks. The dashboard provides real time feedback to users. The feedback uses survey results for areas where people aren\u2019t following virus mitigation techniques, building facilities information like percent maximum occupancy, ventilation and humidity, and movement data. The dashboard serves as an information hub for risk assessment and mitigation for campuses at large. Furthermore, this dashboard would provide information for individuals to assess their own risk. Post-COVID, the dashboard can be used to overlay positive emotions on real places, to identify areas of comfort and wellbeing, and provide building owners and operators, and organizations feedback regarding occupant experience, thus identifying environment features that enhance their occupants\u2019 health and wellbeing. Lack of information about safety risks and comfort of places causes stress and anxiety for those entering those spaces, especially in the context of viral risk. Public and private policies for large groups of people are created, in large part, based on the idea of risk and reward. The multi-variable analysis required for assessing risk lacks the necessary variables. For example, number of people in certain locations, ventilation in specific buildings, number of people social distancing or wearing masks, etc. And, even if that information is collectible, there is a large time gap between collecting the information and assessing the information. This is a solution to the real time information gap. Real time risk assessment for those who make policy and for those who are on campus weighing their own risk and reward. This allows people to make the decisions that are right for them. Much like applications that allow drivers to chart a path around events like accidents, this dashboard allows individuals to chart their path around risky situations, and therefore mitigating risk for individuals and groups alike.",

For example, the standard 14 day quarantine is given to all who contact a COVID-19 positive individual if that contact was less than 6 feet for more than 15 minutes. In contrast, this improvement to existing technology is a multi-variable analysis of distance, volume of exposure, and likelihood of infection to give the user a personalized recommendation for self-quarantine. There are several other apps that have used the Google/Apple API and open source code to develop and improve inter-device communication applications. This invention is an improvement of both the probability of infection to the user and determining distance between Bluetooth devices. Bluetooth attenuation has been validly used as a way to determine distances between devices for the past several years. However, there are variables that make the calculation difficult and inaccurate. For example, the orientation of the device relative to the other, receiver strength, emission power, etc. All of these variables must be taken into account to pinpoint the distances between individuals. This is relevant because COVID-19 contact tracing apps are generally looking for individuals who stay within 6 feet of each other for over 15 minutes. Additionally, the probability of infection from COVID-19 depends largely on the \u201cshedding rate\u201d of the individual who has tested positive. Furthermore, the risk of having COVID-19 will decrease with each day that goes by without testing positive. This study personalizes the quarantine length and advises the user of their risk depending on all of the aforementioned variables.",

    "ip_description": "This innovative research uses video thermography and a novel algorithm designed to analyze changes in sweat pore activation (SPA). This technology can rival pupillometry in understanding physiological responses under various stresses and circumstances. This is a real-time, non-invasive way to detect sweat pores\u2019 response to stimuli, both physical and emotional. In society today, mental health is acknowledged perhaps more than any other time, as universally important to an individual\u2019s health. Physiological markers accompany certain disorders, for example PTSD, but those markers are difficult to measure or evaluate. This technology can improve how professionals evaluate some of those physiological markers. The American Psychiatric Association claim that 3.5% of American adults suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), but only 11 people are diagnosed. As a society, we are understanding the effects of mental health problems on concrete physiological responses to the human body. The novel steps in this technology allow for a new way to evaluate stressors like PTSD in, for example, candidates for positions where understanding of one\u2019s mental or emotional stressors are required. Furthermore, in the realm of professional and amateur athletics, athletes would have the ability to test their response to emotional and physical stressors and adjust accordingly. While other methods of evaluating the Automatic Nervous System (ANS) exist, they can be difficult to operationalize and often require wearing multiple sensors and complicated equipment. This method frees the individual from those inconveniences, allows the user or researcher to test a wide variety of situations, and does so in a non-invasive manner. Aside from improving athletic performance and screening for appropriate candidates, there is a growing market for diagnosing and treating mental health disorders. This study explored the possibility of identifying physical markers, such as sweat gland response, to physical and emotional stimuli to perhaps indicate triggers for PTSD. There is a research grant market, and a market for healthcare treatment of these conditions. This technology fills the need for innovative and versatile ways for detecting stressors and treating individuals who suffer from disorders like PTSD.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a recombinant protein that is designed to restore the activity of immune cells that have been exhausted in patients with cancer. This invention focuses specifically on the restoration of the anti-cancer activity of immune cells, in particular natural killer (NK) cells. Immune cell-based therapies are a widely utilized technique to fight off various illnesses. Notably, CAR-T cell therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment against cancer; however, CAR-T cell generated using exhausted T cells is not effective and continuous stimulation of CAR-T cell can lead to immune cell exhaustion. Immune cell exhaustion causes the cells to lose their functionality and reduces cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. Thus, once immune cells, like NK cells, have become exhausted, they become ineffective in fighting against cancer. There are other methods for restoring NK cell efficacy; however, these methods are not able to permanently restore exhausted NK cells. On the contrary, this invention can be used as an adjuvant with immune-cell based therapies in order to restore the NK cells during the treatment and/or the cell expansion and results in permanent restoration of the anti-cancer activity of those cells. Applications include restoring activity of exhausted immune-cells, increasing cytolytic activity, decreasing expression of inhibitory antigens on exhausted NK cells, enhancing cytokine secretion, inhibiting tumor growth, and can be added to the culture media during immune cell expansion. Advantages include permanently restoring immune-cell functionality, can be used on a variety of different innate or adaptive immune cells, and is not restricted to the treatment of cancer.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a system and device that modifies visual displays such as computer screens, televisions, and smartphone screens to emit light at wavelengths that provide therapeutic effects. As electronic devices with display screens are becoming increasingly common, the amount of time spent in front of screens is correspondingly growing. A UK survey found that the respondents spent, on average, 3 hours and 23 minutes of screen time per day, adding up to 50 days over a year. Screen time is particularly high among teens and tweens; in 2019, teens spent 7 hours and 22 minutes of screen time per day, even after excluding screen time for school or homework. Given the trends in screen time, it is no surprise that society has paid increased attention to the potential harmful effects of spending so much time in front of display screens. In particular, the blue light emitted by these devices has been linked to eye problems such as dry eye, cataracts, and macular degeneration, as well as disruption of biochemical processes like production of melatonin and other hormones. In response to these concerns, solutions have been developed that limit blue light exposure from electronic devices. Popular solution include software that eliminates blue light or simulates the natural sunrise/sunset cycle, tinted glasses, and sheets applied to the physical screen. This invention takes a different approach. Instead of merely eliminating the effects of blue light, it provides a controllable source of green light. Green light has been shown to be have therapeutic properties, including for pain reduction and reducing the severity and frequency of migraines. This invention therefore offers the potential to provide therapeutic effects by precise control of the intensity, duration, and wavelengths of green light during use of electronic devices.",

The inventors have identified a number of promising lead compounds which bind to and interrupt neuropilin 1 (NRP-1) signaling. This is an important first step in the development of small molecule inhibitors that could not only be used to treat neuropathic pain and cancer, but also serve as a preventative measure against SARS-CoV-2 virus entry. COVID-19, a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to infect millions of people worldwide and no therapeutic has been made commercially available as of yet. One promising therapeutic approach would be to inhibit neuropilin 1 (NRP-1) signaling, as there is evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling pathway in order to gain viral entry into cells. Additionally, NRP-1 has also been a long-time focus of drug discovery efforts for cancer treatment and represents a novel target for treating neuropathic pain as well. Thus targeting the inhibition of NRP-1 would not only be an innovative method for preventing SARS-CoV-2 virus entry, but would also be advantageous in the treatment pain and cancer.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a design of a spherical hybrid Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and ground vehicle that minimizes energy use while traversing extreme terrain both on the ground and in the air. The robot can roll over flat and uneven terrain and, when obstacles are too big or difficult to maneuver around efficiently, the robot can transition into an unmanned aerial vehicle to get around them. Exploration of unknown areas presents terrain that is unpredictable and weather and temperature conditions that can be extreme. Furthermore, energy consumption of drones and robots is a major concern for space exploration. The problem is navigating the terrain in the most energy efficient way possible with a vehicle that can collect information effectively. The designs in this invention address those problems. The spherical cage allows the robot to roll on the ground over relatively flat terrain for up to an hour. The propellers on six axes allow the robot to produce the thrust to maneuver in any direction depending on the terrain. The propellers also allow the robot to take to the air to maneuver around extremely difficult terrain for up to 20 minutes. The combination of being able to roll and fly allows the robot to map out the most efficient route to its destination. This design can save more than 10 times the energy compared to other robots performing the same tasks. Furthermore, the sensors and electronics can either be in a sealed box or outside the inner sphere in the center of the robot depending on the expected conditions. This allows for more versatility in planned missions. The added protection for electronics may also be necessary depending on the required equipment. Energy is the driver of design, innovation, and expense. While designed primarily for space exploration, this robot could be used in agriculture, space flight, and defense. Covering large distances with complicated sensors is not always possible with a simple drone. This design provides a new solution to a drone-filled market concerned with energy consumption. Previous approaches to conserve energy have included modifying search patterns, mimicking biological locomotion, and slowing operation when possible.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a method used primarily for mining that extracts metals using electrodeposition from a mixture of refined ore and molten salt in order to reduce the melting point. Much like the process of extracting aluminum from Bauxite, gold is extracted from ore using electrodeposition as a replacement for the widely used sodium cyanide mixture. Mining for precious metals like gold, silver, and copper fuel economies across the world. These metals are very commonplace--all of the major technology used on a daily basis requires these precious metals in some capacity. However, the state of mining technology relies heavily on cyanide in the United States and mercury and cyanide throughout the world. The health problems that stem from using poisonous mixtures are prevalent throughout the world in the environment and the surrounding populations. This technology is a replacement for both heap leaching and vat leaching for mercury and cyanide. Using molten salts and electrodeposition allows the mining industry to transition from the poisonous processes of the past, for a more efficient, environmentally friendly process for the future. Furthermore, this process in some cases increases the amount of metal extracted from the ore. While cyanide typically recovers about 90% of precious metals after several rounds of leaching, molten salt treatment as described here recovers between 90 and 98%. A similar process is used in extracting aluminum from Bauxite and has been extremely effective in that field. This technological step forward is to lower the required mixture temperature thus decreasing energy costs and making the idea more plausible for companies to adopt. Not only is this technology environmentally and morally responsible, but economically efficient. Mining is essential for the lives of people across the globe. Equally essential are those who work in refineries and those who live around these mining practices. This technology can be the future of the industry and a more responsible and efficient step forward.",

The use of guayule also provides for enhanced anti-termite and/or enhanced anti-insect properties as compared with particle-boards formed from non-bio-based adhesives and wood fibers. The cost of making wood composite has increased due to the increase in the price of wood supply; hence, guayule bagasse could be one of the alternative less expensive options.

    "ip_description": "This invention is an ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) system that disinfects air through ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation. The system has low power consumption and high sterilization and flow rate to both neutralize airborne pathogens and filter all the air inside a room quickly without disturbing the environment inside the room. Removal or neutralization of airborne pathogens from air inside a hospital, classroom, restaurant, nursing home, or store can reduce odor, allergens, and pathogens causing infectious diseases. Among the many techniques, UVGI that utilizes UVC light of optimal wavelength in combination with air filters is the most common. This UVGI system can operate as standalone or in addition to the existing ventilation system. The configuration can be optimized for high air change per hour (> 10 ach) without sacrificing room comfort and noise level. The UVGI market offers a number of commercially available products, ranging from small standalone units for sterilization of individual rooms to large scale screening of industrial HVAC units. However, many products rely on existing air flow systems rather than optimizing air flow and sterilization in an integrated system. Applications include healthcare air disinfection and HVAC ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. Advantages include efficiency, high air change rate, adaptability to different room size and shape, effectiveness, and improved performance over existing systems.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a monolithic membrane optomechanical sensor, capable of achieving micro-g sensitivity for acceleration sensing in a monolithic, chip-scale platform. It consists of two membranes with differential stiffness on a single silicon chip. Due to the differential stiffness, both the membranes react differently to the actuating force. This displacement between the two membranes can be monitored with high precision using the cavity formed between the two reflecting surfaces.\n\nThis kind of sensing can apply to accelerometry, vibrometry, shock and acoustic sensing.\n\nMicroelectromechanical systems (MEMS) integrates four components: microsensors, microactuators, microelectronics and microstructures in a silicon chip. MEMS sensors are a major component in safety-critical applications and emission control applications in the automotive industry. While this is the main market, optical accelerometers are used for seismic and vibration analysis, inertial measurement and automotive security monitoring, as well as motion, tilt and swivel applications in gaming devices.\n\nAs technology advances, there has been an increasing need for MEMS sensors to become more accurate and take more measurements. Generally, MEMS devices lack the stability and accuracy required for autonomous navigation; more complex and expensive interferometric methods for measuring acceleration are needed. An accelerometer that is accurate, stable and inexpensive to integrate within electronics would be an improvement to the market.",

Phase maps have a variety of uses, from medical diagnosis including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to interferometric surface characterization in manufacturing and synthetic aperture radar interferometry used for geological measurement and object characterization in aerospace applications. Phase unwrapping algorithms serve the important role of supplementing whole number wavelengths to the interferometric sub-wavelength phase measurement for a complete characterization of the surface being measured. Generally, these algorithms are computationally intense, and users of interferometric data search for ways to reduce computation complexity without sacrificing accuracy in order to achieve \u201creal time\u201d operation of interferometric scans. Iterations of solutions from Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to solve equations of 2D Laplacian operators is a common technique, though not the exclusive approach. Surfaces with steep gradients or discontinuities present the greatest challenge for phase unwrapping, often leading to higher errors at boundaries. This technology presents an algorithm modification with improved boundary accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Applications include medical imaging (such as MRI), interference-based microscopy, topology surveying (such as interferometry synthetic aperture radar), and other image reconstruction applications. Advantages include being fast/efficient, more accurate than other fast techniques, and broadly applicable.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is an innovative greenhouse designed to dry food waste at scale. This radical design maximizes the temperature gradient within the tower to minimize drying time. The solar dryer uses solar radiation, requiring minimal energy input. The dried food waste can be stored and used as needed to fertilize fields, feed livestock, or it can be sold as a commodity, turning a waste stream into a revenue stream. In the United States alone, a staggering 62.1 billion pounds of fruit, vegetable, and grain waste end up in the landfill each year. This amounts to an economic loss of $75.5 billion. The biggest constraint on salvaging this food waste is time: food waste needs to be processed before it rots. More modern use of greenhouses to increase drying rate typically have a single layer of drying plant material at bench or ground height. This is adequate for small batches of agricultural produce, but not sufficient to handle large-scale drying. Industrial scale food drying technology using drum-dryers or spray-dryers are fast but require huge energy inputs and are cost prohibitive. This design for a solar dryer will allow large-scale drying of agricultural waste or manure that can be stored for later use as livestock feed or fertilizer. Evaporated water can be reclaimed and used for irrigation or other needs. The dryer will enable large scale repurposing of food waste, generate income from waste, reduce landfill usage, and reclaim water with a minimal input of energy.",

The signal created by this sensor board can then be used with any off-the-shelf wired or wireless data acquisition system. Sensors are increasingly used for structural monitoring. For example, networks of hundreds of strain-measuring sensors can be attached to large structures such as bridges, to analyze their performance in real time and identify potential problems with greater accuracy than visual inspection. Existing technologies typically make use of sensor elements that detect strain by changing their electrical resistive properties in the presence of changes in strain. However, these sensors have limited effectiveness in larger structures because each individual sensor can only measure a small area, often requiring expensive arrays of sensor elements to cover a larger area. Capacitive strain sensors offer the promise of covering larger areas. But existing capacitive sensing solutions do not provide the level of sensitivity to make them feasible in monitoring strain on larger steel structures. This technology solves this problem, detecting minute strain deformations at a high sampling rate. Applications include wireless sensor networks and structural health monitoring. Advantages include being inexpensive to produce, ideal for wireless applications, and the ability to accurately detect low levels of capacitance with a high sampling rate.",

    "published_date": "3/26/2021",
    "ip_description": "University of Arizona researchers have created sugar-based low molecular weight hydrogels that spontaneously self-assemble through weak, noncovalent intermolecular interactions. These gels are thixotropic, biocompatible, and biodegradable. Despite being held together through non-covalent interactions, these hydrogels exhibit greater mechanical strength than other non-cross-linked hydrogels. These hydrogels are biocompatible and biodegradable since the materials are based on sugars. The other advantages of these low molecular weight hydrogels include resistance to acidic and salty environments, stability at human body temperature, and formation in water without requiring additives. These hydrogels are based on alkyl glycolipids which are readily produced in large quantities through a scalable, high-yield synthetic process. Hydrogels have been utilized in many biomedical fields, including dermatology, drug delivery systems, stem cell delivery systems, bonding and coating systems, tissue engineering or repairing systems, wound healing, cell culture, etc. One current field of study is concerned with tissue and tissue manipulation using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) compounds. Another field of study is using biopolymer-based hydrogels as scaffolds or artificial extracellular matrices that provide growth spaces for cells from the viewpoint of tissue engineering. The scaffolds or artificial extracellular matrices allow cells to grow better or in desired directions for the purpose of tissue engineering. Some of the biopolymers currently used for producing hydrogels include polysaccharides such as glycogen, chitosan, cellulose, and hyaluronic acid. These biopolymers are often converted into hydrogels by physical crosslinking or irreversible chemical crosslinking. The process of cross-linking biopolymers to produce hydrogels results in high molecular weight hydrogels and requires additional time and cost. Unlike high molecular weight hydrogels, low molecular weight gels (LMW) are composed of small molecules that aggregate via noncovalent interactions and form fibrous 3-D networks or porous structures that immobilize solvent. Thus, LMW gels do not need any cross-linking steps, and therefore, are less costly and time consuming. In addition, LMW gels are known to be thermoreversible, gel at low concentrations, and have high tolerance towards salts. LMW hydrogels are some of the most unique gels, as they are mainly composed of water; this allows their potential use in diverse applications in soft materials and biomaterials including drug delivery, cell growth, enzyme immobilization, and tissue engineering. Sugars have long been of interest for use in LMW hydrogels. However, common hydrogel compositions with functional properties utilizing sugars have relied on complex gelator molecules with relatively complex chemical syntheses or are based on materials harvested from natural sources requiring extensive effort. Therefore, there is a need for a simple method of producing LMW hydrogels using readily available sources.",

As ARDS onset can occur very quickly after the appearance of mild respiratory symptoms of COVID-19, it is essential to have a means to monitor and quickly identify respiratory decline before it reaches a critical level.\n\nCurrent evaluation of respiratory distress and failure uses cumbersome and relatively invasive pulmonary function tests (e.g. spirometry, lung volume, lung diffusion capacity, etc.).

    "ip_description": "This technology is a method of identifying road roughness (i.e., International roughness index, IRI) by collecting sensor data from a smartphone app or other computing device and applying deep learning techniques to estimate the road\u2019s roughness index. Monitoring of road surface conditions is a logistical challenge. Traditionally, road condition monitoring for maintenance and repair relied on driver reporting and expensive and infrequent comprehensive surveys. As a result, roadway condition data tended to be poor quality and out of date. Recent alternative solutions have made use of smartphone sensor information to automatically provide road condition information in a fast and cost-effective manner. However existing solutions suffer from either a lack of accuracy, the need for mounting extra sensors to the axle of vehicles, or calibration of the tool to provide validated baselines to compare with. This technology leverages modern advancements in deep learning to provide high quality estimates of the roughness of a road\u2019s surface without the need of calibration or extra hardware. Applications include municipal road maintenance and smart traffic management. Advantages include a simple smartphone app approach, inexpensive, accurate, more timely than traditional road condition surveying solutions, requires no calibration / baselining, requires no installation of specialized hardware, and any passenger vehicle can be a road roughness sensor without calibration.",

    "ip_description": "This invention uses surface codes to implement an extendable quantum communication network. Quantum communication makes use of quantum physics to create highly secure networks that are immune to many techniques used to intercept the communication while in transit. But because quantum information degrades quickly, there are limitations on how far the information can travel. This limitation is addressed by placing intermediate nodes between the source and destination, which act as \u201crepeaters\u201d to break the transmission into several steps of shorter distance. However, existing quantum repeater technology is inefficient and introduces latency into the transmission. Furthermore, the security of a quantum communication network relies on the assumption that the nodes used to receive and transmit information are themselves secure. If a node were to be compromised, it could undermine the security network. Accordingly, as more repeater nodes are added, the network as a whole becomes less secure. This invention uses surface codes, a technique used for error correction in quantum technologies, to implement a quantum communication network that leaves the nodes less susceptible to compromise and eliminates the latency typically introduced at repeater nodes. Applications include banking and financial institutions, critical infrastructure, military applications, and telecommunication networks. Advantages include enhanced security, increased communication distance, and low latency.",

The 3D printing technology enables the device to be custom manufactured to conform to an individual\u2019s body and to be mounted without applying adhesives to the skin. Epifluidics is a rapidly evolving area of microfluidics, where devices are applied to the surface of the skin, typically to collect tiny amounts of sweat for analysis. The sweat can then be analyzed within the device to look for particular markers. Research suggests this type of technology can be used to non-invasively detect many health-related metrics, including hydration levels, blood sugar levels, and blood alcohol levels. As an emerging area of innovation, there are few commercial applications of epifludics available. Furthermore, current technologies are generally limited in that they can be bulky and rigid, and they require the use of adhesive to keep them attached to the body. As a result, current epifluidic technologies are generally not conducive to long-term use. This technology solves these limitations by leveraging 3D printing to create a soft, flexible device custom-manufactured to conform to an individual\u2019s body, which in turn eliminates the need for adhesives to keep it in place and enables it to be worn comfortably for longer periods of time. Applications include fitness monitoring / athletic training, chronic health condition monitoring, and skin health analysis.

Computer simulation to rationalize and predict the behavior and course of atoms and molecules in chemical and materials systems has been of critical importance in the chemical and allied industries for several decades. The advent of supercomputers and parallel processing has opened the door further for accurate predictions of chemical behavior which could previously only been usefully interrogated with empirical methods. In the last decade, various research groups have developed algorithms for predicting the structure and behavior at the atomic and molecular level taking into account quantum effects of atomic systems and states of electrons.

It is a new configuration for fabricating transmission holograms using composite master holograms and reflection holograms using a pair of master holograms. It produces a method that is scalable and able to increase the type of waveguide holograms that can be fabricated. This invention has the potential for commercial application in augmented reality displays and solar energy systems. This method utilizes successful replication techniques from prism-coupled assemblies without the drawbacks of limited spatial frequencies in those systems. Volume Holographic Optical Elements (VHOE) are a type of diffractive optical elements with applications in solar energy, display systems, security, and medical imaging. Holographic optical elements (HOE) can be classified into two main types, thin and volume. Historically, VHOEs have been used in customizable applications, but this application is becoming more commercially available as technology matures. Manufacturability still lags development so improvements to ease manufacturing are valuable to process efficiently an increased commercial demand. Currently, contact-copy is the main manufacturing process. It uses a master hologram that creates copies of itself through contact with a photopolymer. However, this process is not well suited to input beams that are non-planar or when apertures of the VHOE need to be well-defined. A prism-coupled technique used total internal reflection of beams to create replication holograms without these limitations, yet the technique required an air gap between the master hologram assembly and replication hologram, which prevented the production of waveguide holograms because the air gap limited spatial frequencies of the interference pattern created by the object and reference beams.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a method of detecting an online impostor using keystroke dynamics without requiring prior collection of behavioral data from the true user. Keystroke dynamics is an area of behavioral biometrics that attempts to identify or authenticate a user by collecting data about how a user types, such as the length of time between key presses and the duration a key is depressed. This information can then be used to detect changes in typing behavior, which may suggest the person typing is an impostor or bot. This technique has seen widespread adoption in recent years and adds a layer of security that can augment traditional knowledge-based authentication such as providing a username and password. One limitation of keyboard dynamics for authentication is that it usually requires establishing a baseline by training the detection mechanism with normal typing activity by the authentic user. As a result, keyboard dynamics is generally ineffective if the user is new or no prior data has been collected on the user\u2019s behavior. This invention is innovative in that it requires no prior user interaction and therefore can be used for new accounts or in applications where behavioral data is not collected across multiple interaction sessions. Applications include online fraud prevention in eCommerce, banking, and insurance, as well as enterprise identity and access management.

In the same vein, an estimated 7.1% of all US adults experienced at least one major depressive episode in 2017. And these numbers are limited to the clinical definition of depression; other people may experience shorter-lived depressed mood or other negative moods but would not meet the clinical criteria to be classified as suffering from a depressive disorder. Mood is also closely intertwined with general health and wellbeing. Research suggests that adults with a depressive disorder or depressive symptoms have a 64% increased risk of coronary artery disease, and early treatment of depression can decrease the risk of heart attacks and strokes by nearly 50%. Furthermore, depression accounts for 490 million disability days taken off work each year in the US, at an estimated economic cost of $100 billion per year.

    "ip_description": "This invention is concerned with improving manufacturing accuracy and speed of Volume Holographic Elements (VHOEs) through more accurate diffraction efficiency measurement in real-time measurement conditions. Diffraction efficiency is an important characteristic of VHOEs, and the most basic technique for controlling the diffraction efficiency during fabrication is to use separate beams to expose the holographic material and measure the material\u2019s efficiency. However, this technique is time consuming and requires additional equipment. Ideally, a measurement technique that used the exposure beam would reduce both these limitations.\n\nThe technique proposed in this invention works by periodically blocking an exposing beam during the fabrication and measuring the power of the diffracted beam using a power meter. Once the diffraction efficiency of the VHOE is measured to reach the desired value, the exposing beams can be shut off. Since this measurement is performed in real-time, the method has potential to account for the local variations in the material or laser power variation that cause the necessary exposure time to fluctuate between samples.\n\nMost Volume Holographic Elements (VHOEs) must attain certain diffraction efficiency depending on the design. In many designs the diffraction efficiency should be maximized, while in other designs, such as exit pupil expanders in waveguide display systems, the diffraction efficiency is intentionally a lower value. In other setups, light from a separate laser at a different wavelength from the construction wavelength and at a separate incident angle is used to measure the diffraction efficiency. The diffraction efficiency at the construction wavelength can then be obtained through mathematical approximations. However, this method requires additional equipment and complicated experimental setups and the mathematical approximations reduce the accuracy of the method.\n\nIn this invention, a new technique for monitoring the diffraction efficiency of VHOEs in real-time is proposed that has potential for higher accuracy and greater simplicity than previous setups. The invention has potential for fabricating VHOEs that have precise tolerance in the required diffraction efficiency.\n\nApplications:\n*   Industrial manufacturing of volume holographic elements\n    *   Waveguide holograms\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Simpler/less equipment\n*   Precise and real-time",

    "ip_description": "This invention proposes a quantum network of satellites in order to provide global coverage. The idea is to have terrestrial quantum networks be connected with low earth orbit satellites and have a subnetwork of medium and greater earth orbit satellites. This invention capitalizes on the security and speed of quantum networks and common satellite communications. Quantum communication takes advantage of the laws of quantum physics to protect data. These laws allow particles\u2014typically photons of light for transmitting data along optical cables\u2014to take on a state of superposition, which means they can represent multiple combinations of 1 and 0 simultaneously. The particles are known as quantum bits, or qubits. If viewed, qubits break down to either a 1 or 0 because of their fragile quantum state. This makes quantum communication secure because information cannot be viewed or tampered with when it is being sent. Quantum networks facilitate the transmission of information in qubits between physically separated quantum processors. A quantum processor is a small quantum computer able to perform quantum logic gates on a certain number of qubits. Quantum networks work in a similar way to classical networks. The main difference is that quantum networking is better at solving certain problems. Applications include 5G wireless networks, Internet of Things, Optical networks, Autonomous vehicles, and Satellite communication. Advantages include being secure, providing global coverage, and being reliable.",

    "published_date": "6/24/2020",
    "ip_description": "This invention is a system that can be used to record non-verbal vocalization and mathematically analyze the breathing sounds of patients. The breathing sounds are crucial to diagnose patients who have a chronic or acute respiratory illness. Analysis will include: HNR, NHR, EE, STE, ZCR, SR, SC, SF, jitter and shimmer. In addition, the system can integrate sound elements with neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) technology. In recent years, the prevalence of respiratory diseases like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema have increased. Millions of people in the US and globally are diagnosed with respiratory diseases every year. It is believed that more than 30% of the information about the patient comes from nonverbal cues. In routine doctor-patient interactions, much of the nonverbal acoustic information is not captured and is lost. This information is valuable for all cases and breathing sounds are a main source of information in diagnosing a patient with a respiratory illness, irregularity, or disease. Current methods involve spirometry which is a way to measure airway obstruction by measuring inflows and outflows. There is a lack of utilizing spirometry as a diagnostic tool because of a knowledge gap for physicians and the availability of spirometers. Many patients with respiratory illness are wrongly diagnosed due to the similarity in symptoms for common diseases and illnesses. This technology has the potential to improve current diagnosis methods and enhance the accuracy of respiratory diagnosis, improving patient care. Applications: In home diagnosis, Medical facilities. Advantages: Ease of use, Accurate, Draws conclusions from math and algorithms, Uses neuro-linguistic programming.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a pump system developed to serve as an artificial heart. This is an electrically driven device without fixed valves that functions with \"functional equivalents\" of valves via a sliding vane. The vane serves to propel flow as well as to partition flow. A high bandwidth positive displacement reversible pump/motor with two embodiments is proposed. More than 5 million Americans have heart failure, with 670,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, such as ventricular assist devices (VADs) and total artificial heart (TAH), have emerged as approved frontline therapy, providing restoration of failing circulation, as either a bridge to transplantation, or an alternative to transplantation as destination therapy. While MCS is vital and effective in restoring hemodynamics, sadly, more than 70% of implanted MCS patients require re-hospitalization within one year of implant due to thrombosis and/or bleeding. Additionally, infection from device bulk and exiting drivelines is a major limitation as well. Most current MCS devices are either piston-cylinder-like positive displacement architectures (SynCardia, Carmat, Berlin Heart) with valves to direct flow directions or fast spinning turbine or centrifugal architectures. The proposed invention architectures are able to generate the same amount of required flow rate with a more compact size and at a dramatically reduced speed due to its positive displacement feature. The reduced speed would lead to lower shear stress on blood and lower blood damage. As positive displacement architectures, valves are eliminated, thus reducing valve-related blood damage. Applications include Total artificial heart (TAH), Ventricular assist device (VAD), Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system (ECMO), Power supply for soft robots, and Surgical platform using soft catheter robots. Advantages include Positive displacement, Compact, High bandwidth, Reversible, and High power density.",

    "ip_description": "This invention represents a new chemical composition of photoresponsive, polymer photoresists, where the refractive index of the polymer can be modulated via UV radiation to facilitate the arbitrary writing of optical waveguides and other photonic devices in the material. The material can be spun on to any substrate or existing photonic device architecture and, through lithography, create polymer waveguides and enable interconnecting of individual silicon integrated photonics chips, functioning as an inexpensive optical interconnect medium. The ability to transfer an optical signal between waveguide devices is critical in the formation of optical printed circuit boards, which can provide faster processing and potentially lower cost than traditional electric printed circuit boards. Optical interconnections can be directly written to connect spatially separated waveguides using maskless lithography. The material composition leads to low optical propagation loss at telecommunications wavelengths such as 1310nm and 1550nm. A photonic integrated circuit (PIC) integrates one or more optical components, such as modulators, lasers, detectors, multiplexers and demultiplexers, attenuators and optical amplifiers, into a system. Large-scale PICs, like their large-scale electronic counterparts, may have complex organization, requiring effective interconnections for desired system performance. Next generation photonic devices have ever increasing needs for accelerated methods to fabricate waveguiding elements and optical interconnects. In particular, polymer waveguides play an important role as optical interconnects facilitating incorporation of silicon photonics elements into the electronic processing framework, which is the new paradigm for fulfilling the demand on data centers and high performance computing. Hence, there is a compelling need to simplify and streamline polymer waveguide fabrication techniques which require spatial control of refractive index (RI, or n). While extensive efforts in polymer science have focused on methods to prepare optically transparent, high RI polymers, the creation of photoresponsive polymers, where the refractive index can be spatially defined in planar thin films to create refractive index contrast is a distinct technical challenge requiring a new class of RI-tunable materials.",

    "ip_description": "Hydrometallurgy is a technique within the field of extractive metallurgy, the obtaining of metals from their ores. Hydrometallurgy involves the use of aqueous solutions for the recovery of metals from ores, concentrates, and recycled or residual materials. The focus of this study is on an environmental hydrometeorological recycling process of Germanium (Ge) from electronic wastes. For this purpose, the dissolution factor is considered, and a type of weak acid (acetic acid) is used to extract Ge from the electronic wastes, which has the lowest impact on the humans and the environment. Results show that there are significant opportunities to meet the future demand of Germanium (Ge) by concentrating recovery efforts in the extraction and beneficiation/smelting/refining stages. Up to now, the existing studies about the recovery of Ge mainly focused on the hydrometallurgical processes to extract Ge, followed by a process to separate Ge from other elements contained in leachates. The negative point of those methods is the high consumption of strong reagents. Hydrometallurgy uses strong inorganic/organic acids or caustic watery solutions to selectively dissolve and precipitate metals. The goal of this method is to use a technique that avoids the strong reagents that are not only harmful to the environment but also very toxic to humans. Some electronic waste recovery methods come with severe environmental implications such as open burning, acid leaching, uncontrolled dumping of hazardous elements and hazardous wastes, etc.",

Interferometry uses constructive and destructive interference in waves to obtain information. One common application of this field is to examine the properties of a surface, often at nanoscale. When mounted on machines, interferometers enable manufacturing at extreme levels of precision. Dual-mode inferometers use two different types of light to look at a surface and either measure the shape of a surface or its roughness depending upon the type of light used. However, existing dual-mode interferometers are unable to freely change between modes. This technology solves the problem by combining both surface shape and roughness measurement into one compact interferometric system and eliminates the need to reconfigure the system when switching between surface shape and roughness modes. Applications include precision machining, optical manufacturing, and interferometric microscopy. Advantages include being compact, convenient (no reconfiguration required to switch measurement modes), working with a wide range of spatial frequencies and aperture sizes, and minimizing environmental disturbance.",

    "ip_description": "This invention proposes combining snapshot phase-shifting interferometry with high resolution polarization imaging to create quantitative phase maps from diffraction microscopy. A polarization grating separates the incident beam into object and reference beams, and a digital camera captures four phase-shifted interferograms from polarization filters to reconstruct a high spatial resolution phase map. Due to the common path configuration and snapshot feature, the proposed system provides a feasible way for real time quantitative phase measurement with minimal environmental impact. Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) refers to methods of collecting high resolution images and using both phase and amplitude data to create quantitative phase maps. These are particularly valuable for microscopic examination of tissue samples because data can be collected with minimal harm to the tissue and in some cases may be collected in vivo. Traditional QPI methods require widely separated optical paths, which can introduce noise through vibrations in the setup or even air turbulence. Diffraction phase microscopy and other off-axis imaging systems reduce this noise through using a common optical path for the object and reference beam, but this configuration often limits the size of the imaging field that can be collected. Also, creating the phase maps can be computationally intensive, preventing real-time imaging. Algorithm refinement can reduce the processing time for holographic imaging (another off-axis image collection method), as can optimization of graphics processing. This invention overcomes these limitations by using a diffraction phase microscope with polarization grating, phase-shifting interferometry, and a polarization camera to create a larger field real-time phase map. Similar approaches use holography with spatial light modulators, diffraction phase microscopy with optimized graphics card processing, polarization wavefront shaping, and digital holography with polarization states.",

Patients with colorectal cancer often receive chemotherapy as a primary treatment or as a pre/post-surgery treatment for their cancer. One of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of colorectal cancer is 5-Fluorouracil. 5-Fluorouracil is used due to its high effectiveness rates against colorectal cancer. Current oral administrations of pro-drugs for 5-Fluorouracil, capecitabine and tegafur, must be metabolized in the liver before 5-FU can be released, thus, the drug is not concentrated in the colon, but rather is systematically available.

The idea is that there are going to be so many satellites and other debris in low-Earth orbit that collisions between objects may become inevitable. Because of the high density of space debris, those inevitable collisions could cause a cascade where any collision creates a greater likelihood of future collisions. The reality of increased space debris makes space travel and launches more difficult. Furthermore, the satellites that orbit the Earth often in low-Earth orbit are in constant danger of impact from space debris.\n\nThe Gatekeeper is a solution to the inevitable collision problem between satellites and space debris. The Gatekeeper is designed to be installed in a satellite that can determine the probability of a collision with space debris and warn the satellite/users if there are possible collisions. This warning system would allow the satellite time enough to make proper collision avoidance adjustments.\n\nSince the late 1950s, humanity has what can be regarded as an obsession with sending persons and things into space. Since then, many satellite constellations are currently orbiting Earth for global communications, Global Positioning System etc. Researchers are constantly working on small, micro, and nano satellites as well as different ways to improve communication and wireless transfers of information. Expansions into space have allowed humanity to exist in an entirely different way.\n\nHowever, low-Earth orbit now has thousands of pieces of space debris that threaten to damage multi-million dollar projects as well as the health of the utilization of low-Earth orbit space for generations to come. With all of these issues building, projects to bolster spacecraft shielding, space debris collection and disposal, and space debris tracking and avoidance have increased.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a mobile intraoral camera which consists of a flexible intraoral probe to reach the base of the tongue and tonsillar region of the oropharynx, a mobile process unit to capture, store, process, and transfer images, and automated image processing to identify suspicious areas within the mouth. Intraoral cameras are an alternative that dentists may use instead of mirrors to review and examine the mouth of patients. The added benefit of using an intraoral camera compared to a mirror is that it provides the dentist high-resolution images of a patient's mouth that are real-time and the data can be stored for future reference. These images can be stored for time analysis of patients for better health care by providing timed data. There are three main restrictions with current methods: Some devices do not have a flexible head; therefore, to navigate around the tongue or bend the camera, one would have to move the full device. Images collected do not have analysis on them. It requires a trained dentist to manually review the image and provide details on analysis. Devices are expensive, usually priced at more than $1,000. This invention addresses the first two restrictions of the current market. It provides a flexible head that is able to bend 90 degrees forwards and backwards for enhanced image collection. It also provides a scan of oral tissues to identify suspicious regions, deep learning-based lessons for guidance on the need for biopsy, with biopsy location, and data collection for remote diagnosis. This area is patent-dense, with numerous inventors describing oral screening systems involving sensor screening devices and image processing. Commercially available devices like VELscope, Identafi, and ViziLite do not offer a consolidated package for collecting images from all areas of the mouth and identifying suspicious lesions from collected imagery. Instead, these devices are operated by a clinician during oral examinations.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a bicycle handlebar-mounted device. The device has a sensor that can detect when a car is too close to warn bicyclists of encroaching vehicles and provides a visual alert to the car\u2019s driver to promote a safe passing distance from the bicyclist. The device can also take and store a picture of the vehicle and license plate for reporting to authorities if needed.\n\nStates generally have laws that mandate that an automobile must give a bicycle a minimum amount of space while passing on a road. The reality is that this rule is seldom followed. For an example, in 2013 there were nearly 50,000 bicyclists who suffered injuries as a result of automobile drivers. The introduction of bike lanes has been shown to reduce the frequency of injury and death by up to 90%, however not all roads contain bike lanes. Bicyclists continue to endure the risk of injury and death due to negligence of drivers who do not maintain a safe passing distance, regardless of whether they ride in a bike lane or not. This technology will create greater accountability of drivers and further decrease the rate of automobile-related bicyclist injury and death.\n\nApplications:\n*   Detects vehicles too close to bicyclists\n*   Warns vehicles of bicyclists\n*   Documents vehicle information via pictures of license plates\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Can be used to notify local law enforcement of vehicles intruding on bicyclist\u2019s space\n*   Promotes bicyclist safety\n*   Portable and rechargeable device that can be installed on a bicycle handlebar",

Over half of the 270,000 breast cancer diagnoses in the United States are for early stage disease; this is the population of women who will ultimately benefit from this research. A majority of these women will be candidates for breast conserving surgery, which consists of removal of the primary breast cancer with a surrounding margin of normal tissue. Breast conservation is associated with decreased operative risk, shorter recovery time, and decreased disruption of body image and quality of life. Furthermore, there is no difference in breast cancer mortality between lumpectomy and total mastectomy. Because of these significant advantages, breast conserving surgery continues to be the preferred operative approach for unifocal breast cancer. Applications: Breast conserving surgery.

Non-melanoma skin cancer is the most common neoplasm in countries with high rates in caucasian populations and in cases of high UV ray exposure. In the United States alone, there are more than half a million new cases per year. Despite the fatality rate of non-melanoma skin cancer being minimal, it is known to cause significant impact including severe local destruction, permanent disfigurement and disability. Currently, there are several recommended preventive measures for skin cancer including recommendations for avoiding UV rays from the sun or tanning beds, utilizing broad spectrum sunscreen and scheduling routine dermatologist examinations. Even with these preventive measures available to most, skin cancers cases are still bountiful. The need for more advanced preventive measures would significantly reduce the amount of cases yearly.

    "ip_description": "This invention is an adaptive optics (AO) system for broadband and/or polarization dependent light. The system includes a wavefront sensor and compensator, and the compensator splits the broad waveband into different wavelength and/or polarization states, applies compensation, then recombines the light into a single wavefront with distortions that may be compensated by following optical elements of the AO system. The wavefront compensator is based on known optical corrections techniques but applied in a new way. The area of adaptive optics and correction techniques applied to optical signals is patent dense, but this combination of techniques and application appear to be novel within the field. Adaptive optics (AO) is a technology used to improve the performance of optical systems by reducing the effect of incoming wavefront distortions by deforming a mirror or applying an optical filter like a spatial light modulator (SLM) in order to compensate for distortions. In existing AO systems, the compensation is the same for light of all wavelength and polarization states. The system works well as long as the distortions for different wavelength and polarization state are the same. For light sources with a broad range of wavelength and different polarization states, the distortion compensation will be incomplete, leading to greater blur in the spatial resolution in the resulting image. This invention proposes a design of an AO system that can better compensate distortions in broadband and polarized light.",

Thus, communication and sensing are made possible by manipulation of these photons and/or observation of the changes of these photons.\n\nThis invention is a way to generate entangled light via on-chip components. This chip is integrated with microring (ring) resonators which is the component that produces the resonance of light waves. The combination of on-chip interferometers allows for coherent quantum measurements. Tapered waveguides are used to increase the quantum coupling efficiency.

Traditional quantum sensors are large and use expensive components that limit practicality and scalability. This method proposed is another way to scale all the bulky components onto a chip which is millimeters in size. This is done using traditional semiconductor fabrication techniques. The ability to put a quantum sensor on a chip is a dramatic decrease in the size of the sensor and will allow for better integration into real world applications. This will also greatly decrease the cost it takes to produce quantum sensors because it builds off of traditional fabrication techniques.\n\nApplications:\n*   Quantum sensing\n*   Quantum information\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Less expensive\n*   Smaller size\n*   Practicality\n*   More efficient",

The new scheme is of both high selectivity and high recovery, meanwhile the dosage of reagent required is much less, and the flotation temperature is also significantly reduced.\n\nBastnaesite is the most important ore mineral at the Mountain Pass mine in San Bernardino, California near the Nevada border. It is an important ore of the rare earths, especially the lighter end members, including europium. Bastnaesite is also an important ore mineral at a number of other rare earth mines in China, including several deposits in Sichuan Province, and the massive deposit at Bayan Obo, Inner Mongolia.

This direct oxidation method may be used to synthesize organic semi-conductors for use as photovoltaics, transistors, LEDs while avoiding poor yields, product impurities, and expensive work-up. This method has been demonstrated for selectively oxidizing the K-region of pyrenes using a meta-free oxidizing agent to produce a pyrene 4,5-dione and/or a pyrene 4,5,9,10-tetraone compounds. Pyrene compounds are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules that are used widely in various applications including, but not limited to, use as fluorescent probes and starting materials for producing various organic electronic components such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs), and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Chemical modifications of pyrenes through a variety of methods enable their incorporation into more complex chemical systems make them useful starting materials for larger organic semiconductors as they enable the extension of the \u03c0- conjugated system via simple condensation reactions with ortho-diamines. This strategy enables the synthesis of imine rich N-heteroacene chains known as pyrene-fused pyrazaacenes (PPAs) that exhibit a wide range tunable semiconducting properties (p-type to n-type) unlike their nitrogen-free acene counterparts. Owing to the two Clar sextets provided per pyrene subunit, PPAs are air-stable even above 500C. Even though ortho-quinones of pyrenes are useful starting materials for the synthesis of PPAs and other organic semi-conductors, their synthesis via direct oxidation of pyrene derivatives have been difficult due to lack of selectivity to desired products, even with expensive transition metal catalysts, as well as the expense and loss of product during purification due to formation of tarry residue. Moreover, use of these transition metals results in wastes that are environmentally toxic and requires additional cost and time for disposal.",

This hybrid is a fusion of geopolymer and biopolymer that results in a high load stiffness, high peak strength, and large residual strength compared to current cementitious material used in this application. This increases the safety of underground mining.\n\nUnderground mining is essential for acquiring materials in everyday use. Underground mining consists of digging tunnels and/or shafts into the earth. As these structures are built in the early and equipment is moved into the earth to extract the material, strong support structures are required within the tunnels and shafts to prevent ground falls. Ground falls lead to 8 to 10 fatalities and approximately 800 injuries globally each year. Therefore, design and construction of roof supports, to prevent ground falls, are critical to ensure safety. The intrinsic supports systems, such as roof bolts, and standing support systems, such as cribs and posts, are the two most common roof support systems. These support systems provide the three key factors for roof supports. These key factors include maximum load-carrying capacity, stiffness, and residual strength. Secondary factors include timing of installation, stability of support as it is loaded, and capability of support system to provide skin control.

The proposed variants of pixelated polarization filters would have applications in display and sensor designs and could cover light sources, such as organic light emitting diodes or liquid crystal light panel, to form a polarization display which can display an image of arbitrary polarization states. This is a patent-dense area, and the novelty in this invention is that the polarization camera design is perfectly achromatic for measurement of linear polarization state and the process reduces the transition region between pixels. For many applications, there is a need to create an array of polarization filters with well-defined shape and orientation. For existing CMOS and CCD optical sensor arrays, the size of the pixel can be of the order of one micron or smaller. There is a need to create patterned polarization filters that have the same dimension and shape as the pixel. The current problem in practice, is a transition region between regions of one alignment angle and an adjacent region of an alternate alignment angle. This can range from 0.5 to 5 microns and limits the spatial resolution of the patterns in the polarization filter. The disclosed research provides a fabrication technique that can reduce and/or remove the limiting transition regions.",

This method uses multi-spectral digital holographic imaging and random phase masks to extract phase maps comparable to maps from traditional quantitative phase imaging (QPI) optical systems though with less complication and expense. This method provides a fast, low-cost method for acquiring detailed multi-spectral data for cell objects.\n\nImaging biological cells and tissues is central to research and medical diagnosis, and imaging tissues requires contrast to distinguish areas of interest from the background. In the past, use of dye or other form of staining or tagging structures was necessary to achieve sufficient contrast but this contrast data was qualitative rather than quantitative. Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) emerged as a method to create a phase map of the sample to indicate refractive / optical path differences through tissue structure. Digital holography captures both phase and amplitude data from interference of reference and object waves, but phase maps do not separate tissue physical thickness differences from refractive differences. Instead, use of multiwavelength digital holography can provide quantitative 3D color images and dispersion information.\n\nApplications:\n*   Health research\n*   Biological imaging\n*   Cell and tissue imaging\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Faster and more accurate\n*   Lower cost than current methods",

    "ip_number": "UA20-135",
    "published_date": "4/15/2020",
    "ip_description": "This technology is an improvement to the well-established microscopy technique structured illumination microscopy (SIM), which uses a periodic structured pattern of light to image a sample. In SIM, it is common for artifacts to arise during imaging, because the pattern is often distorted due to aberration and index mismatches in samples. These artifacts distort the image and reduce the amount of information that can be extracted from the raw data. This technology is capable of correcting distortions in challenging experimental situations, such as strong background scattering, low signal-to-noise-ratio, and a sparse sample structure. In addition, it is easily applied to existing hardware, making it cost-effective and simple to implement into existing workflows, as opposed to current solutions which utilize much more expensive adaptive optics to accomplish the same effect. Structured illumination microscopy has been around since the late 1990s but is still being improved as a technique. SIM can be used in multiple ways: optical sectioning structured illumination microscopy (OS-SIM) and super resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM), among others. OS-SIM allows the technique to act much like a confocal microscope, reducing out-of-focus light and thus increasing contrast. SR-SIM can be used to increase a microscope\u2019s resolution below the diffraction limit of light, previously thought to be impossible. While it is currently better suited to techniques like OS-SIM, this technology has the potential to be applied to both types of SIM. Other techniques for reduction of out-of-focus light exist, like Leica\u2019s Computational Clearing technology, but they are more limited in their potential applications. This technology has the potential to cheaply and easily improve results from existing structured illumination microscopy hardware in a variety of different applications.",

We call this method lipid exchange-mass spectrometry (LX-MS). The concept is that if a membrane protein binds a certain type of lipid, it will shift the equilibrium distribution of lipids between empty (tagged) nanodiscs and membrane protein (untagged) nanodiscs. We quantify the equilibrium distribution by measuring the lipid composition in the membrane protein nanodiscs after exchange. By titrating the lipid composition, we can determine the optimal ratio of lipids surrounding a membrane protein. This assay should be general to any membrane proteins or lipids and uses small amounts of samples.\n\nMembrane proteins make up the majority of drug targets yet only account for 2\u20133% of high-resolution structures. Thus, there is a great need for improvements in structural biology and drug discovery with membrane proteins. One important question is how membrane proteins interact with lipids and remodel their local lipid environment. It is clear that the lipid environment can be critical for membrane protein structure and function, but there are no methods to measure the optimal lipid composition for membrane proteins. Current methods of screening different lipid compositions are inefficient and costly.\n\nApplications:\n*   Drug discovery\n*   Structural biology research\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Quantitative design for lipid-membrane systems\n*   Label-free\n*   Design for automation",

Photons from nanophotonic devices have degrees of freedom which allow for more information to be encoded in the photons. This allows the neural network to be expanded.

This method works best for convolutional neural networks where the same set of operations is repeatedly applied to different data. Machine learning currently is limited by the size of the neural network being worked with. This method allows for the neural network to be expanded which allows for a more efficient machine learning method. Wavelength multiplexing allows for multiple signals to be encoded in multiple wavelengths which increases the volume of data that can be processed in a time period. Machine learning is often very intense on computing and it takes a long time to build a neural network.

It was discovered that over-expression of TMEM184B caused a reduction in scratching in response to interleukin-31 (Il-31) exposure. This was surprising given previous studies had shown that knock-out of TMEM184B resulted in a reduction in Il-31 induced scratching. Increasing the activity and/or abundance of TMEM184B in a patient may be used to treat itch. Chronic itch affects up to 15% of the population. It may be caused by inflammation or more serious diseases of the kidneys, liver, nerves, and cancer. Chronic itch can impair quality of life, leading to disrupted sleep and anxiety / depression. Somatosensory neurons transduce multiple types of stimuli, including temperature, chemical, and physical changes in the local environment of their nerve endings. Nerve endings receiving these cues can also directly sense inflammatory compounds, and this inflammation alters their response properties to cause hyperalgesia (heightened responses to noxious stimuli) and allodynia (painful responses to non-noxious stimuli). A common consequence of increased skin inflammation is the triggering of itch. Acute and chronic itch are significant morbidities in humans. Itch-causing pathological conditions have a variety of causes, including skin disorders (atopic dermatitis), drug-induced reactions, systemic disorders such as liver disease, and other neurological disorders. The sensation of itch is distinct from pain and is carried by a subset of itch-specific somatosensory neurons called pruriceptive neurons with cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Skin itch is triggered by release of pro-inflammatory compounds such as cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31), thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and histamine from mast cells and epithelial cells, which act upon membrane receptors and channels present in epidermal nerve endings. In addition to chemical itch, mechanical stimuli can evoke similar itch sensations but rely on a distinct spinal circuit.",

In addition, the invention surrounds the process and manufacturing of these newly formulated Suramin microparticles and nanoparticles so they can be effectively used in the treatment of wounds. Specifically, these new formulations would be utilized for wound healing purposes in mucositis and diabetic foot ulcers.\n\nOral mucositis is a consequence of chemotherapy and radiation treatment of head and neck cancer, the third most common cancers with nearly 550,000 cases per year. However, chemotherapy and radiation have horrible side effects, with the most common being ulcers and sores of the mouth and throat, otherwise known as mucositis. Nearly 40% of patients undergoing chemotherapy and 100% of patients receiving radiation experience mucositis, which results in pain, trouble breathing and swallowing, and infections. In addition, diabetic foot ulcers occur in nearly 15% of all diabetic patients and precede nearly 85% of all diabetic related amputations.\n\nThese serious complications of highly prevalent diseases have limited treatment options. If left untreated, mucositis and diabetic foot ulcers have horrible effects on patients ranging from pain and infections to the loss of a limb. This invention re-formulates Suramin to help promote wound healing. Currently, Suramin can only be administered intravenously, which means a medical professional must administer each dose and each dose is delivered invasively.

    "ip_description": "For many applications, the output of a laser diode is coupled into an optical fiber to direct the light beam more easily. This fiber can be doped with rare earth metals such as Erbium to increase efficiency and absorption. Instead of using Erbium (Er3+) exclusively for doped fiber lasers, this method proposes the use of codoped Er3+ fiber lasers with Holmium (Ho3+) and Dysprosium (Dy3+). Current Er3+-doped lasers can only reach the 2.8-2.9 micron wavelength range but deliver a high power output. Ho3+/ Dy3+-doped lasers lack the power output of Er3+-doped lasers but are able to reach wavelength regions above 3 microns. By codoping Ho3+ and Dy3+with Er3+, compact all-fiber lasers above 3-micron meter can be developed with the use of readily available, high power, and efficient diode lasers.\n\nBackground:  Erbium is the most common rare earth element used in fiber lasers because the available atomic energy levels for excitation and decay better match light energy output (wavelengths) from cheaper diode sources. Fiber laser beam quality is high and the power output is over 6kW, which is very high compared with a traditional gas or crystal laser. Fiber lasers are also efficient (70%-80%) which means they consume less power and are easier to cool. Because the beam remains focused within a fiber, it can be very small which makes fiber lasers an excellent source for laser cutting.\n\nA fiber laser requires an energy source, such as 980nm pumped light from a laser diode coupled to the fiber, to produce the beam. This light energy source stimulates emission in the doped material of the fiber which creates the beam along the laser fiber. Emission is generally lower energy than the pumped energy \u2013 1535nm compared with 980nm \u2013 but some heavy metal fluoride upconversion fiber lasers (ZBLAN) use multiple stimulated phonon transitions to produce higher energy emissions (480nm output with 1140nm input). ZBLAN fiber lasers may also be used for longer wavelength emission in the \u201ceye-safe\u201d region beyond 1400nm though output power remains lower than for shorter wavelengths.\n\nApplications:\n*   Material processing\n*   Medical\n*   Sensing\n*   Imaging\n*   Spectroscopy\n*   Defense (directed energy)\n*   Telecommunications\n\nAdvantages:\n*   3-micron meter wavelength regions\n*   Cost efficient\n*   Energy efficient",

This chemistry enables new polyurethane compositions from sulfur comonomers. The method of synthesis can be easily scaled to large-scale production, and can be processed into water or polar solvent-based formulations. The material may be sprayed or processed into films. Various product families can be made with available polymers used as termonomers. Research efforts have been directed towards exploiting the special high-performance characteristics of polymers with sulfur in the backbone. Sulfur is a byproduct of refining petroleum which has limited use and is being stockpiled. Sulfur polymers have the potential for reducing the amount of hydrocarbons required for plastic production. Applications include thermosetting polymer, polyurethanes, and flame retardant. Advantages include tuneable properties with termonomers, high solubility in water and polar solvents for ease of formulation in sprays or films, and the re-use of sulfur waste product from petroleum refining into high value polymer.",

Angiogenesis is considered a hallmark indicator of tumorigenesis and is believed to be required for tumor growth and metastasis. HIF-1 is a master regulator gene involved in the cellular response to hypoxia.\n\nIn attempting to develop effective treatments against solid cancers, it has been shown that prolonged activation of HIF-1 is associated with greater resistance to anti-angiogenic agents.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a new type of lipid vesicle or liposome that can be used to encapsulate drugs and genes for therapeutic applications. It improves upon existing liposome formulations in its increased stability, subsequent increased circulation time, and effectiveness as a nanocarrier. For many years, therapeutic drugs were released in an uncontrolled and untargeted manner. This often resulted in drastic side effects, most dramatically exemplified by the side effects of chemotherapy treatment. Much research has been conducted to create more advanced systems for drug delivery that allow for controlled release of the therapeutic payload, with better control of temporal and spatial distribution of the drug. One such advancement in the field of advanced drug delivery systems has been the liposome, or lipid vesicle. Liposomes consist of one or more bilayers of lipid molecules that form a shell with an empty core when dispersed in a liquid medium such as water or blood. They have been used to encapsulate drugs and deliver them at controlled rates to specific targets in the human body, but have conventionally been prone to many issues such as instability, leading to unsatisfactory release kinetics and circulation times. The technology has implements a liposome based nanoparticle that will improve upon the current technologies. Cholesterol has been included in liposome formulations because it helps to stabilize the lipid membrane, but it is prone to transfer from the liposome into other biomembranes, lipoproteins, and lipid vesicles, which again destabilizes the liposome. The inventors have discovered innovative way to prevent cholesterol transfer from the bilayer and increase stability. Applications include delivery of drugs such as cancer therapeutics and delivery of genes for gene therapy. Advantages include more stable, better circulation times, more effective drug delivery, and tuneable to accommodate various payloads.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is an improvement to a commonly used drug delivery vehicle: liposomes. Liposomes, while useful for their improved pharmacokinetics, have not demonstrated significantly improved efficacy and patient survival. This may be in part due to the fact that generally only one drug can be loaded per liposome. However, this technology allows co-delivery of multiple drugs. Coupled with its sphingolipid composition, this technology has the potential to result in therapeutics that not only have improved stability and circulation time, but also greater efficacy in treating patients. It is also a versatile approach that enables the creation of liposomal formulations of drugs which are not currently possible with existing liposomes. Liposomes (spherical lipid bilayers enclosing an aqueous center) can be used to deliver hydrophilic drugs (in the center cavity) or hydrophobic drugs (within the lipid membrane). Compared to non-liposomal drugs, liposomes circulate in the bloodstream for a longer period of time, and they are also capable of accumulating at the sites of tumors or infections. Improvements to their structures have been made\u2014they can be temperature- or pH-sensitive for controlled release, or coated in PEG to reduce immune detection\u2014but there is still much room for improvement in clinical outcomes. Traditional liposomes compete with other methods of drug delivery, such as lipid nanoparticles and micelles, but this invention is poised to begin a new era of improved liposomes with broader applicability in terms of payload, and improved therapeutic outcomes.",

    "ip_description": "This invention describes composite filaments for fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing, and the methods of their production. This novel blends of filaments have better properties for 3D printing bone scaffolds with improved degradation kinetics and functionalities. Due to an aging global population, the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders is increasing. Today, small volumes of bone or bone-like materials are commonly used in a variety of treatments to help heal or fuse a patient\u2019s bones as necessary. These bone grafts are generally autografts (bone sourced from the patient\u2019s own body), or allografts (bone from another person\u2019s body). Each type of graft has its own issues: taking bone from elsewhere in a patient adds cost, complexity, and pain for the patient to the procedure, and sourcing bone from another person leads to potential for rejection by the immune system. Bespoke, patient-specific bone scaffolds that can be made on demand are being developed to circumvent these issues, through methods such as electrospinning and various types of 3D printing. Currently, most filaments available for purchase for use in fused deposition modeling-type 3D printers consist of a single type of material, which limits their chemical and mechanical properties. This invention are filaments composed of different materials with different properties, allowing the creation of 3D printed objects such as bone scaffolds with more tunable properties and more functionality, which can be used to satisfy the demand for bone grafts in an era of increasing prevalence of musculoskeletal disease. Applications: Implantable bone scaffolds, For healing bone defects, For fusion of bones. Advantages: Patient specific and available on demand via 3D printing, Better mechanical and chemical properties than products produced with single-material filaments, No extra surgery necessary and reduced chance of rejecting the implant.",

    "ip_description": "Deflectometry is one of the potential techniques for freeform surface metrology. The display panel is either LCD, LED, or OLD and it displays a certain pattern onto the freeform surface. The cameras then record how the pattern is distorted on the surface and this is fed into a processing unit where it calculates the surface shape. This invention involves a robust and easy to use deflectometry system for measuring freeform surfaces. The system includes three cameras, two which are positioned at the edge of the display panel and one in the middle. The processing that this invention uses consists of a trained neural network to more accurately calculate the surface shape. The two main issues with freeform surface metrology are that systems of this nature are not robust enough and they are often very difficult to use. It\u2019s difficult to use because the location of parts must be precise and information about the surface must be known to be able to make a precise calculation. The system will be robust as the cameras and display panel are integrated into one unit. This also helps with ease of use because the cameras and display panel will be in the same location relative to each other. This gets rid of the problem with having to know the precise location of components. Lastly, this solution utilizes a deep learning model to obtain the surface shape based on the patterns captured by the cameras. The multiple camera approach allows for a more accurate surface capture.",

Utilizing this method, the level of exosome release can be correlated with AMD onset and severity. Thus, if a drug can reduce exosome release in RPE assays, then it would be a good candidate for drug development to mitigate AMD symptoms.\n\nAMD is a loss of central vision that occurs in dry, atrophic, or wet, exudative forms. Most people with macular degeneration have the atrophic form. While there is no specific treatment for atrophic AMD, studies have shown a potential benefit from vitamin supplements, a healthy diet, cessation of smoking, and perhaps intraocular injections. The current invention would allow for new modalities and medications to be innovated to assist in treating the disease more effectively.\n\nAccording to data from the American Optometrist Association, AMD \u201cis the leading cause of severe vision loss in adults over age 50.\u201d More than 1.8 million people have AMD and 7.3 million more are at substantial risk for vision loss from AMD according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

There are five types defined by the World Health Organization, each based on the root cause of the elevated blood pressure. All types of pulmonary hypertension are serious, and if untreated, can lead to right heart failure and even death--group 3 pulmonary hypertension has a 1-year mortality of 46%, followed by group 2 at 40.9%. Among neonatal patients, there are limited therapies and drugs that have been approved for the treatment of PAH. Currently nitric oxide is an existing treatment, but it is not widely used. Pulmonary hypertension is currently not curable, but its symptoms can sometimes be managed. Partly thanks to its \u201corphan\u201d status, a number drugs have been recently developed to treat group 1 pulmonary hypertension directly, but other types are often approached in terms of treating the underlying disease or even surgically.

The ADR is a reportable rate of a doctor\u2019s ability to find adenomas, attempt of endoscopic removal of polyps, and more.\n\nColon cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer deaths globally and the second highest in the United States. Regular screening tests, such as a colonoscopy, can detect forms of cancer early. Early detection allows for more treatment options and a lower chance of mortality. It is vital for these screening tests to be accurate and identify any signs of cancer, making it imperative to have accuracy and levels of quality control.\n\nAdenoma Detection Rate (ADR) is a calculated rate at which a physician finds one or more pre-cancerous polyps during a screening colonoscopy procedure. This quality benchmark has several stakeholders, so it is important to have an accurate ADR calculation. Manual calculation is not the most precise way due to human error and poor documentation. The adoption of an automated electronic calculation will reduce the chance of errors and ensure patients are aware of their physician\u2019s success with their procedures.\n\nApplications:\n*   Automated calculation of Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR)\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Reduced chance of error\n*   ADR rates updated rapidly",

This invention generates and measures an RF signal (millimeter wave) and processes the data with machine learning to extract and identify body motion within a region. Unlike other systems that focus on breathing or heart rate, this system can distinguish larger scale motions of specific limbs.\n\nThis detection system includes both hardware and computationally efficient algorithms to detect motion and interpret it in terms of human skeletal components. Similar patents focus on detecting motions through walls for security or detecting motions for computer-human interactions.\n\nCurrently, there are several technologies that are able to provide imaging of humans through a wall or another obstruction. These technologies rely on identifying vital signs like minor chest movements during breaths to detect humans, but these can be inaccurately recorded in complex environments. The tracking of skeletal structure motions would enable more detailed and accurate imaging.\n\nClothing is highly transparent in the millimeter-wave band of electromagnetic radiation which makes millimeter-wave sensors an obvious choice for security screening purposes. Passive and active millimeter wave systems are commonly used to detect concealed objects. However, the nature of this longer-wave technology far outside the visible wavelength range makes image processing of the data collected more intensive; the data must be heavily analyzed to create 2D images. Therefore, it is advantageous to use efficient algorithms for faster frame rates.\n\nAs an alternative to monitoring systems, some groups are investigating uses of RFID chips because they have become cheaper with longer lasting battery life. Yet, these require multiple chips for multiple motions and have applications more for specific medical purposes than remote monitoring.\n\nApplications:\n*   Security monitoring and threat detection\n*   Remote medical monitoring\n*   Detailed body motion sensing for computer-human interactions\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Same methodology applies to systems using single or multiple axes of motion\n*   Computationally efficient",

Research has shown that pesticides are large contributors to the decrease in pollinators. As a result of this research, many pesticides that have the effect on pollinators have been banned in Europe. The issue with simply banning a subset of pesticides, is that eventually, pests will become resistant to the pesticides still in use.

Individuals have the ability to tune the polarization of their lenses based on environmental inputs and their preferences. With this full range of tunability, users are able to maximize their view without having to use just one polarization type for all environments. Currently, there is a wide range of lenses that are offered to individuals when they are looking to purchase eyewear products. Each of these different types of lenses offers a slightly different view and may offer additional eye benefits to the individual. This can include lenses that are polarized to block different types of light, UV-protection, or trivex which is considered to help correct vision more efficiently. Individuals who are looking for polarized lenses have the ability to select different types and levels of polarization. A majority of the polarized lenses offer linear polarization which gives individuals improved contrast and a reduced amount of glare. However, this one type of polarization does not meet every situation for individuals because light can reflect in multiple polarization states and a single polarization type is unable to filter all glare or reflection. With this technology an individual has the ability to tailor the polarization to their need. This allows individuals to be faced with multiple types of light reflection and have the ability to filter it.

The key component proposed in the invention is \"Imbedded Compact Control Actuators\u201d (ICCAs) which will delay or prevent entirely the negative effects caused by the boundary-layer transition, including the detrimental effects of the unsteadiness in flow. This proposed technology will alleviate skin friction and wall-heating to increase payload and range of the specified vehicle while also reducing cost and weight of the vehicle. The fluidic state of the boundary layer, laminar, transitional, or turbulent, determines the degree of skin friction and heating of high-speed vehicles. The drag caused by skin friction contributes a large portion to the total drag of a high-speed vehicle. Higher drag reduces the range and/or maximum payload of the vehicle. High wall-heating requires special materials that are very expensive and/or require Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) that add to the weight of the vehicle so that the maximum payload and/or the range of the vehicle is reduced.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a non-invasive, inexpensive, comfortable and portable diagnostic test to screen for breast cancer. Designed for early detection particularly among minority populations and as a preliminary screening tool before mammography or MRI assessment. Bioelectrical impedance analysis is a simple, quick, and non-invasive technique for measuring breast density and composition. Using bioelectrical impedance analysis as a diagnostic tool for breast cancer screening through examination of the electrical characteristics of breast tissue provides information on a continuous basis to patients in the field without the need for radiological investigations. Measurement of fat and water mass through established algorithms help assess the standard density and composition of breast tissue and identify lesions and abnormalities indicative of breast cancer.\n\nBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the U.S. and makes up 15% of all new cancer diagnoses. In 2016, 3.5 million women in the U.S. were living with a history of breast cancer. Approximately 1 in 8 women (12%) will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. In particular, Hispanic and African American women are known to have a higher a prevalence of breast cancer at younger ages.\n\nThe United States Preventative Services Task Force recommends that women who are 50 to 74 years old and are at average risk for breast cancer be screened every two years. Breast cancer screening methods include: physical exams, mammograms, breast ultrasounds, breast magnetic resonance imaging, and biopsy. Mammograms entail exposure to radiation, patient discomfort, expensive equipment, and visiting a medical facility. A bioelectrical impedance diagnostic test, however, would be portable, non-invasive, inexpensive, and eliminate exposure to radiation. The device could particularly benefit underserved, at-risk populations through field screenings in rural settings.\n\nApplications:\n*   Breast cancer screening\n*   Detection of lymphedema in breast cancer survivors\n*   Potential application for general health diagnostics\n\nAdvantages:\n*   No radiation exposure or toxicity\n*   Facilitates breast cancer screening of at-risk populations\n*   Non-invasive\n*   Portable\n*   Inexpensive",

    "ip_description": "Aerogel is a low-density solid material that is produced by removing the liquid component from a conventional gel. Ambient dried aerogels utilize calculated levels of temperature and pressure using certain chemicals to remove the liquids from the aerogel. This technology is a method of preparation of low density, porous aerogels without the use of supercritical temperatures and pressures from bridged polysilsesquioxane alcogels with dialkylsulfide, dialkyldisulfide, and dialkylpolysulfide bridging groups. These gels are prepared from bis (trialkoxysilyl) monomers which are dried by heating at ambient pressure over a period of days. Aerogels are synthetic, porous materials that are derived from gels. Due to its solid state but low density, it is an ultralight material that can be used as a thermal insulator, desiccant, or even as a means of providing a waterproof coating. Aerogels are used for a variety of purposes from thickening agents to makeup and paint. After discontinued use in the 1970s, efforts began to develop a non-toxic, safer aerogel that was less hazardous and flammable. Aerogels have wide commercial applications in everything from wetsuits, skylights, windows, paints, cosmetics to nuclear weapons. Currently, aerogels are dried by either using freeze or other supercritical methods. These methods are able to successfully dry the aerogels to their final state; however, there are some drawbacks. Both of those methods can be expensive and time consuming. This has led to a hindered growth in the market. A cheaper and quicker drying method would help lead to mass commercialization of aerogels.",

This is particularly important at the farther ends of the tubes, where the tubes branch into fingers. Cancer research has focused on the transfer of pre-cancerous lesions from the fallopian tube epithelium to the ovary surface at this interface.\n\nAlthough rare, ovarian cancer is often deadly because it is detected late.

    "ip_description": "This technology surrounds the usage of plant extract microemulsions for the prevention of biofilm formation on food contact surfaces and medical devices. These microemulsions are non-toxic, plant-based, and are effective against known biofilm-forming pathogens such as Salmonella sp., E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. This invention presents a safe and natural way to prevent the formation of biofilms, thereby reducing the risk of contamination of ready-to-eat food products and potentially medical devices.\n\nThe term \u201cbiofilm\u201d refers to a colony of prokaryotic organisms that have aggregated together, forming a thick film with a protective layer of polysaccharide that is tightly adhered to a surface. Biofilms are particularly troublesome because when protected by the polysaccharide matrix, the bacteria inside can become up to 1,000 times more resistant to disinfectants than when suspended. As a result, biofilms can be difficult to remove once formed, and represent a source of contamination in both the food and medical device industries that can be very challenging to eliminate.\n\nBiofilms are a serious issue in both the medical device and food industries. In the early 2000s, 50-70% of hospital acquired infections manifesting between 2 and 30 days were implant-associated, representing 1-1.4 million cases. Treatment of biofilms in medical devices is very challenging as the above current techniques for removal, such as the use of disinfectants, cannot be used in humans, and antibiotics are often ineffective. Often, surgical replacement must take place if symptoms persist, which can be expensive and risky.\n\nIn the food industry, biofilms can cause outbreaks of disease if the food product becomes contaminated. Biofilms in food production and processing are usually chemically treated, with chlorine-based sanitizers being the most common. Hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and quaternary ammonium compounds are also often used.\n\nThe most effective treatment of biofilms is to prevent bacteria from attaching to the surface and initiating the formation of the biofilm. This invention can prevent biofilm formation, and is likely to be safe for use in both the food industry and medical devices.\n\nApplications:\n*   Biofilm prevention on food-contacting surfaces in food production and processing\n*   Biofilm prevention on medical devices\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Non-toxic (can be used in medical devices in the human body and in food)\n*   Natural and \u201cgreen\u201d appeal\n*   Easily-sourced components",

This progressive disorder is characterized by angioproliferative vasculopathy in the pulmonary arterioles leading to endothelial and smooth muscle proliferation, dysfunction, inflammation and thrombosis.\n\nThe pathology of the disorder is associated with the thickening/remodeling of the pulmonary artery wall. The Atk1 (Protein Kinase B) serine/threonine kinase pathway plays an important role in normal and pathological vascular development and functioning as well as in other cellular functions such as glucose metabolism, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration and transcription. Increased activation of the Atk1 signaling pathway is believed to play a role in PAH pathophysiology through inhibition of apoptotic signaling and promotion of cell survival.\n\nCurrently the disease remains incurable despite existing therapies which are largely ineffective. Patients are therefore limited to invasive heart-lung transplantation which is only available in limited surgical centers worldwide and which has only a 50% survival rate at 5 years.

    "ip_description": "This project proposes three improvements to a falloposcope under development. This falloposcope was designed with optical elements selected for detection of early stage ovarian cancer in fallopian tube epithelium. The data collected by the falloposcope is grounded in a growing body of medical research.\n\nFalloposcopes were used in the 1990s to treat infertility through cannulation of tubal occlusions. However, use waned because devices were fragile and required greater training to use. Plus, IVF was gaining popularity and generally the preferred method for treating infertility. Pregnancy rates from IVF and falloposcopic tuboplasty (FT) were similar though, and better quality images might improve the diagnosis of tubal patency (health of lumen and mucosa) which is a factor for understanding infertility.\n\nAlthough rare, ovarian cancer is often deadly because it is detected late. Pelvic ultrasounds and the CA-125 blood test are generally accurate for detecting late stage III-IV ovarian cancer, but the survival rates are less than 30%, compared with > 90% survival rates for cancer detected in early stages, I-II. Therefore, there is strong interest in developing better early detection screening procedures, particularly for high risk women with the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation. A reliable early detection procedure would provide an option other than removal of all reproductive organs after 40 for high risk women.\n\nResearch includes examining early stage lesions on the surface of ovaries and fallopian tube epithelium. Access to the fallopian tubes through the cervix is an attraction option because it does not involve surgery; instead, falloposcopic examination can be done in a clinic with mild sedation. However, to be effective, a falloposcope must be small enough to pass through the narrow 1mm opening from the uterus to the proximal portion of the fallopian tube but it must have sufficient resolution and field of view to image the 4cm wide fimbral portion of the tube approximately 10cm away.\n\nApplications:\n*   Falloposcopic tuboplasty\n*   Detection of early stage ovarian cancer\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Small diameter\n*   Sophisticated optics\n*   Able to collect variety of data",

The probe will freeze and ablate the gallbladder and cystic ducts but won\u2019t freeze other organs that are in close proximity with the gall bladder. This invention is a less invasive alternative to a cholecystectomy for healthy patients and for patients who are too ill for surgery. Patients who are treated for gallstones often have to undergo a cholecystectomy to remove the gallbladder. Approximately 700,000 cholecystectomies performed annually. Cholecystectomies are performed as either as an open surgery or as a laparoscopic procedure. Surgery is costly and has risks. About 8% of patients have complications. A cholecystectomy can cost between $21,000 and $33,000. Some patients who require cholecystectomies are unable to have the surgery because they are too ill for the procedure. A less invasive and more cost-effective procedure is needed to address these issues. This invention offers a solution that addresses the cost and risk of treating gallstones by using a less invasive method of chemical ablation of the gallstones.",

    "ip_description": "This invention discloses a rate-adaptive forward error correction (FEC) scheme based on spatially-coupled (SC) LDPC codes derived from quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes with its field programmable gate array (FPGA) architecture. FPGA emulation demonstrates that the proposed LDPC codes provide larger coding gain and smaller error floor compared to the QC-LDPC base code with comparable computational complexity. The hardware friendly structure of the codes make them a promising candidate for the next-generation intelligent optical communication systems such as long-haul optical transmission system.\n\nLow-density parity check (LDPC) codes were discussed as early as 1962, in information theory research. The codes have encountered various performance barriers to speed and accuracy when decoding high volume of information, such as Shannon limit performance when information is decoded using a probabilistic algorithm, but continuing developments in new code construction, such as binary spatially-coupled codes based on Euclidean geometry have reduced errors compared with regular LDPC codes. As the speed requirement of modern optical communication systems keeps increasing, forward error correction (FEC) becomes an essential technique to enable high-speed transmission ranging from long-haul to access networks. LDPC codes have long strived for FEC from LDPC block code to the most recent spatially coupled (SC) LDPC code. SC-LDPC code approached asymptotic capacity as LDPC convolutional code (LDPC-CC) in 1999, and much research followed. Further analysis has shown that the decoding thresholds for the LDPC-CC codes are not only better than the belief propagation decoding thresholds of corresponding regular LDPC block codes, but also even very close to the maximum likelihood (ML) decoding thresholds.\n\nThis invention includes a simple method to construct a set of SC-LDPC codes with different code rates that is easily ported to hardware via an FPGA-ready configuration.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a novel Mach-Zehnder interferometer that uses a a pseudo-nulling configuration with a converging beam, to test two optical components against each other, rather that testing one optical component against a reference component. As the capability of optical manufacturing has grown such that it is easy to mass produce optical components with non-symmetric surfaces, optical metrology \u2013 the process of measuring these surfaces \u2013 has also been forced to push in new directions to characterize complex optical surfaces. Various techniques have been used to measure large and small optical elements, from measuring local surface slopes in deflectometry to wavefront differences in interferometry and height differences in profilometry. However, measurement of steep slopes on optical surfaces remains a challenge for all methods and one that hinders fast, accurate measurement. Interferometers are commonly used to characterize optical surfaces. Interferometers compare wavefront properties from a surface being tested with wavefront properties from a reference source through an output called an interferogram. This image contains contrast fringes representing the combination of wavefronts that reveals differences between the test surface and reference beam. One way of measuring complex optical surfaces is to introduce a \u201cnull lens\u201d into the interferometer that acts to correct for deviations in the test surface such that the final interogram is a null image with no fringes. However, creating a physical null lens or a virtual null lens through computer generated holograms is a time-consuming process and one that must be repeated for each new surface under test. Therefore, it is desirable to find other approaches that act like a null lens without actually requiring a null lens. Applications include testing freeform optical surfaces with a short focal length, such as cell phone lens elements, projection elements and heads-up display. Advantages include speed, no moving parts during measurement, and lower cost.",

The automated analysis calculates corrosion rates in an unambiguous and automatic way. It is less time-consuming and arbitrary than the conventional graphical analysis used currently. The data analysis is used in an automated test station which is currently being developed at the Water Energy Sustainable Technology (WEST) center in Tucson, Arizona. The data is of primary interest for converting electrochemical (I/V) data to corrosion rates (pipe metal loss rates). The crucial aspect of the invention is that it takes raw measured electrochemical current and voltage data and gives a metal loss rate and corrosion potential. Throughout the world, society is powered by often unseen pipes that transport water and other products through pipes. Because of the importance of such pipes, there is the constant need to ensure they are working properly. This helps to reduce costs and prevent destruction caused from leaks. Leaks themselves can often be caused by corrosion of pipes. This invention helps to address that problem. Applications include water companies, especially in Tucson and the rest of Arizona, where the technology has been tested; companies that sell corrosion prevention products and solutions; companies that treat corrosion in various piping projects; and potentially applicable to other projects that use extensive piping (i.e. oil and gas).

EOF1 controls the synthesis of eggshell proteins from mosquito follicular epithelial cells. Experiments on mosquitos demonstrated that disrupting the biology of this eggshell formation pathway in the female mosquito after a blood meal results in non-viable eggs.\n\nApproximately 80% of the global population is threatened by vector-transmitted diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, West Nile Virus, zika virus and various encephalitis diseases. Increasing insecticide resistance exacerbates this problem, and insecticides may also harm non-target populations.

    "ip_description": "This invention presents novel multiplexed measurement designs that improve X-ray CT imaging system\u2019s performance. An imaging fidelity metric is employed to optimize multiplex measurement design. This considers the next generation Rectangular-Fixed-Gantry (RFG) CT system architecture containing several X-ray sources and detector arrays deployed in a fixed geometry. Such an RFG CT system architecture affords us the opportunity to explore non-standard multiplex measurement designs employing simultaneous illumination from multiple sources. The goal of the multiplexed measurement design is to minimize the bag reconstruction error. X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) based systems are widely used for security and industrial inspection applications like passenger baggage and cargo screening at the airports, shipping container screening at ports, and industrial parts inspection. Typically, such CT systems employ a mechanical rotating gantry, with a X-ray source and detector array(s), to collect a large number of angularly diverse projections scans of an object. However, such a mechanical scanning mechanism adds to the system cost and maintenance. This invention with optimized multiplexed measurement designs can significantly outperform the sequential measurement design employed in a traditional RFG CT system. Applications include security and industrial inspection applications such as passenger baggage and cargo screening. Advantages include higher system throughput, less complexity, and lower costs.",

This invention overcomes current system limitations by creating a new class of carbenium-based compounds which are stable and redox active, comprise earth abundant and inexpensive materials, have a tunable design, and are easy to synthesize at moderate to high temperatures. These compounds may also be used as highly fluorescent dyes with large extinction coefficient and long fluorescent lifetimes.\n\nHeterogeneous photocatalysts are limited by system constraints, including inefficiencies in energy utilization, turnover, chemical species mass transport, and need for surface area for photon exposure. Homogenous and heterogenous catalysts may require rare and expensive materials. Use of toxic metals may necessitate expensive downstream separations to remove trace impurities. Removing such limitations can reduce costs and enable new chemicals routes, including supporting applications in green chemistry and renewable energy.\n\nApplications:\n* Inexpensive homogenous catalysts without toxic or rare metals\n* Artificial photosynthesis for direct conversion of sunlight to chemicals\n* Fluorescent reagents or dyes\n* Novel organic molecule synthesis\n\nAdvantages:\n* Stable homogenous catalyst\n* Earth abundant molecular catalyst\n* Efficient light absorption\n* Tuneable via a variety of molecular designs\n* Use of low energy light (> 500nm)",

    "ip_description": "This technology is an extended depth of field (EDOF) system that maintains high lateral resolution while extending the depth of field. It is based on white light interferometry but adds a feature where the interferometer scans through the different depths of an object to create a depth map.\n\nWhite light interferometry offers a solution to the age-old trade-off in optics between depth of field and lateral field of view. Using white light interferometry, contrast fringes in interference images appear near zero optical path difference and best focus. By scanning through a range of height positions and integrating the resulting 3D data cube into a final 2D image, one can create a focused, full-color 2D object image. However, this process is both data collection and processing intensive. This project proposes a method to reduce both data collection time and the degree of post-processing needed to create a final focused image.\n\nThe relative phase between the signal and reference of the interferometer is not taken into account when examining the contrast fringes. The most accurate height measurements with height resolution on the order of 0.5 nanometers are from systems using best focus from contrast fringes and phase-shift data to correlate phase differences to surface height deltas. This project uses the contrast fringes for best focus measurements for height resolution on the order of microns.\n\nApplications:\n* Optical surface profilers (measurement tools using white light interferometry) are available from a number of optics companies, but data acquisition speeds are on the order of seconds. This project could reduce processing time to a fraction of a second.\n* Currently, interferometric methods are used for ophthalmology but interest is growing in the medical community for non-invasive detailed surface measurement techniques.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Leverages existing technology and improves efficiency\n* Faster data collection and less post-processing\n* Expand use of white light interferometry systems to industrial screening conditions requiring higher inspection rates",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a method of processing the interference fringes produced by the UA19-178 system. It employs a threshold-type operation at the incoherent light level so that only constructive interference is recorded, which greatly speeds up the data processing by reducing the amount of data to process in the first place. Processing occurs on the sensor to manipulate the raw signal into the desired form. The sensor\u2019s circuit elements transform the data from each pixel without sending the signal off-chip, thus avoiding the bottleneck effect that occurs from serially transferring the data.\n\nEvent-based vision sensors offer a radical departure from traditional synchronous (frame-based) sensors. Rather than collecting data from an array of pixels at set times, these sensors provide a stream of asynchronous events corresponding to a specified change at a particular pixel address. This means that vision sensors can respond to changes ten times faster than traditional video cameras running at 60 hz while providing data of interest rather than redundant or stale data. However, challenges remain to processing the asynchronous output stream and calibrating pixels\u2019 response within the extensive dynamic range of the sensor.\n\nThreshold processing refers to the circuitry that processes the detectable signals from photo-sensitive elements and converts the signals to digital output that is interpreted by downstream algorithms. Concerns of precision and noise guide choice of circuit design, as well as cost.\n\nApplications: Circuit modifications proposed in this project are tailored for applications involving white light interferometry imagers because they consider the specific computations useful to capturing depth of field and intensity data.\n\nAdvantages: The chief advantage of this modification would be processing speed in systems using white light interferometry imagers.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is an algorithm that provides real-time, high performance, \u201clossless\u201d data compression. Data compression algorithms, such as a zip file, reduce the number of bits needed to store or transmit digital information. The performance of the algorithms is often quantified in terms of a compression ratio. For example, 80% means that the compressed data would use 80% fewer bits than the original. The highest performance algorithms, such as those used to compress video for consumer applications (i.e. an mp4 video file) are \u201clossy,\u201d which means that the information is discarded when it is judged to be not important to the presentation quality of the video. In many cases, in scientific applications such as astronomy, loss of information is unacceptable to the end product. Lossy algorithms typically do very well in both compression and decompression times, although they are optimized for decompression (i.e. playback). However, lossless algorithms, like the zip algorithm, are often very slow in both directions. Applications: Useful in situations where large amounts of digital data are recorded or transmitted, especially when lossy compression is not acceptable; Astronomy; Film production; Useful when raw, uncompressed data is needed for later processing. Advantages: Useful for large amounts of recorded digital data; Reduces or eliminates lossy compression; Useful in both the astronomy and film production fields.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a new medical device designed to replace permanent and invasive methods of weight loss. The device itself is a series of balloons used to gradually decrease the space in the stomach to promote weight loss. Unlike current gastric balloon based interventions that are free-floating and meant to only be utilized in the short term, this technology can be attached to the abdominal wall and can be utilized for long term, sustained weight loss. The technology works to decrease the space in the stomach by increasing the volume in the balloons. This volume adjustment can be done by the physician but also can be controlled by the patient themselves. While surgery is required to place the balloon, the procedure can potentially be performed endoscopically or by an interventional radiologist allowing for lighter anesthesia. The device is not permanent and can be removed. There are many different approaches used to address obesity depending on the individual patient and severity. Morbidly obese patients are potential candidates for various surgical options which are beneficial. However, these procedures are invasive and permanently alter the patient\u2019s anatomy. Gastric balloon placements are considered an alternative to these invasive surgeries for lower BMI patients but most gastric balloon devices run the risk of deflation which can cause an obstruction because the balloons are free floating within the stomach. Applications include treatment of morbid or extreme obesity especially for patients with a BMI >40. Advantages include minimally invasive procedure for placement, adjustable to meet patient\u2019s needs, reduced risk over current surgical procedures and balloon devices, can be used for both long term and shorter term weight loss, and removable.",

Unlike other gyroscopes, which use bidirectional light, this design uses unidirectional light and employs polarization for enhanced sensitivity.\n\nGyroscopes have long been used to sense angular velocity changes, but traditional mechanical, vibrational, or optical gyroscopes tend to be larger than desired for integration in photonic scale systems. This approach has the potential to obtain measurements from a much smaller package that consume less power than standard optical gyroscopes and offers different integration options than larger designs. Another challenge has been how to reduce lock-in effects (higher noise and drift) for low rotation rates and achieve accurate performance without high power consumption from multiple laser sources. Innovations in optical devices have shrunk many functions to photonics scales on the order or tens or hundreds of microns, but so far performance from optical gyroscopes on these scales has not achieved desired levels. There is strong interest in the community developing rate sensors and inertial measurement units (IMUs) to develop these small-scale, accurate gyroscopes that are less sensitive to vibrational and thermal effects.\n\nApplications:\n* Improvements to commercial optical gyroscopes used in sensing and robotics markets\n* Progress towards integrated photonics circuits (smaller scale, less power)\n\nAdvantages:\n* Lower power consumption than standard optical gyroscopes\n* Inexpensive to make as well as operate\n* Less dependent on vibrational environment\n* Offers different integration options, including a smaller design",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a general recipe for seeking quantum optimum receivers. The recipe utilizes machine-learning techniques to automatically generate the quantum optimum receiver architecture beyond reach of human design.\n\nCommunication systems include sources, channels and receivers. The receiver distinguishes the difference between each encoded signal and decodes then into original loaded information with an acceptable error rate. Quantum information theory has proved that the lowest physically reachable error rate of decoding is far below receiver\u2019s error rate. This has created the need for an improved receiver. There has been research and development aimed to design a much-improved receiver. The introduction of deep learning as a computational model can address this complex task.\n\nApplications:\n*   Deep-space communications\n*   Biological sensing\n*   Imaging\n*   Quantum information processing\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Generate architectures beyond human design\n*   Reduce time spent on designing receiver architectures",

    "ip_description": "University of Arizona researchers have developed a drug composition and method of cancer treatment using chemotherapeutics linked to ligands selective for uptake by melanocortin 1 receptors (MC1R) in MC1R-overexpressing melanoma. This development targets melanoma, and may be used with a wide range of cytotoxic drugs, to selectively deliver a toxic payload that may be less likely to result in melanoma treatment resistance and off-target effects of systemic exposure.\n\nMelanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer in the United States, with an estimated 87,110 new cases and 9,730 deaths in 2017. Once metastasized, the median overall survival for malignant melanoma patients is 5.3 months. Despite recent breakthroughs for developing BRAF-V600E and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, current treatments can only improve survival, and tumor cells eventually become resistant to these treatments. The BRAF-V600E inhibitor vemurafenib was shown to prolong the median overall survival of patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma to 15.9 months. However, a mice study showed that 20% of melanoma tumors became resistant to vemurafenib treatment after 56 days. Similarly, 60% to 70% of metastatic melanoma patients are innately resistant to PD-1 inhibitor treatments. To increase response rate and avoid the resistance issue, there is a need for melanoma drugs that can target biological processes that are fundamental for cell proliferation or survival, so that the therapeutic effect cannot be easily bypassed through activation of a compensating signal pathway. Nevertheless, current anticancer agents that target cell proliferation or survival usually have poor selectivity to cancer cells and thus are also toxic to healthy non-cancer cells.\n\nApplications:\n*   Melanoma therapy\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Higher selectivity\n*   Fewer side effects\n*   Circumvents drug resistance in tumor cells",

Uses polymers as an inexpensive substrate in which certain types of nanoparticles are embedded. The invention includes detailed processes of how to embed the nanoparticles and prevent the nanoparticles from aggregating in the polymer. The result is an inexpensive material with a high Verdet constant, which can induce rotation of polarized light (faraday rotation) under the presence of a directed magnetic field. The amount of high Verdet material required is significantly reduced, enabling smaller optical components which can be more closely integrated into optical systems. Materials with a high Verdet constant are used in optical components for lasers and telecommunications. These materials are known as \u201cFaraday Rotators\u201d due to their property of rotating the polarization of light when placed in a directed magnetic field, and are used in optical rotators, optical isolators and optical circulators. For example, high-powered lasers need optical isolators to prevent light reentering the laser possibly causing damage to the laser. The most commonly used high Verdet constant materials are Terbium Gallium Garnets (TGG). These materials are expensive as well as somewhat difficult to manufacture. Other options exist but are also generally expensive and/or are difficult to manufacture.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a system designed to perform optical quality metrology on freeform or convex optics. This system provides a full aperture surface reconstruction sag map of freeform surfaces. The method relies on the creation of virtual source enclosure that surrounds the unit under testing (UUT) and produces a virtual 2 Pi-steradian measurement range. Freeform optics provide many possibilities in the design of cutting-edge optical systems. However, their fabrication and metrology are challenging. To verify the freeform shape, two non-contact optical metrology methods are commonly used for UUT, interferometry and deflectometry. Interferometry offers high accuracy and precision in surface metrology. However, this method relies on prohibitively expensive computer-generated holograms and requires a null setup to obtain accurate results. Deflectometry is an alternative non-null test method that relies on rays leaving a source, being deflected by a UUT. Convex optics both standard and freeform are highly challenging to measure. Interferometric approaches typically require measuring sub-apertures that are then stitched together. The required setup is not always a viable option. Deflectometry is used in 3D construction for surfaces up to weak convex surfaces; however; a full aperture optical precision test of general convex surfaces is yet to be achieved. Applications include metrology of freeform and convex optics. Advantages include creating a full aperture surface sag map of freeform surfaces including highly convex surfaces.",

    "ip_description": "This invention provides methods and compositions for inhibiting cancer cell survival and/or promoting cell death following radiation or chemotherapy applied in cancer treatment. This invention is a second set of Ku70/80 inhibitors that can sensitize cancer cells for chemotherapy. A first set of Ku70/80 inhibitors was previously discovered by University of Arizona researchers (UA14-189). Ku70/80 is a protein that repairs radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), causing the cancer treatment process to be prolonged. UA19-131 in combination with UA14-189 would prevent Ku70/80 from binding to DNAs so that they cannot perform the DNA repair function.\n\nRadiotherapy is a key component in the management of 40% of cancer patients cured of their disease. It is a highly effective treatment strategy and is one of the most cost-effective treatment modalities in oncology. For all tumors, there is a dose-response curve that indicates better control with higher doses of radiation. Radiation therapy, however, can damage normal cells as well. As a result, researchers are searching for drugs that make tumor cells easier to kill when combined with radiation therapy to improve clinical outcomes for patients. The FDA granted approval to a combination of radiotherapy with a targeted agent in March 2006, but no new drug-radiotherapy combinations have been approved since. There is a great need in this industry for novel approaches including immune-oncology or DNA-repair inhibitor agents combined with radiotherapy.\n\nApplications:\n*   Usable in combination with radiation or chemotherapy to sensitize malignant cells during cancer treatment\n*   Application as a radio-sensitizing drug for use in combination with radiotherapy for the treatment of various cancers\n*   Cancer treatment\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Reduced damage to normal cells during radiation therapy\n*   Sensitizes tumor cells to radiation therapy to kill them faster\n*   Limits negative side effects of cancer treatment",

Each of the methods increase the output and when combined have the potential to significantly increase the output and module efficiency (up to 55.78% estimated increased energy yields compared to the standard common PV cells) without significantly increasing the manufacturing costs. The increased energy yields could lead to systems with lower LCOE (levelized cost of energy).\n\nRenewable energies address the rising concerns about the sustainability of fossil fuels as the world\u2019s main energy source. Solar energy is widely available, creating high potential for the implementation of photovoltaic solar energy conversion systems. However, the cost per watt ($/W) and cost per kilowatt-hour ($/kW-hr) performance of photovoltaic solar energy conversion is still poor compared to that available from fossil fuels and even other renewable energy sources.

The series of designs transforms a CubeSat into a lander with four legs to optimize space exploration. The four landing legs, each with a foot structure and connected via rotational supports, allow for degrees of freedom for a soft landing. The design and configuration on the legs was developed through trials of structural analysis which determined the occurrences in worst case scenarios. The innovation also has a decreased weight and volume compared to other products within the market. Exploration of the Earth\u2019s moon has the potential to answer a multitude of questions. For example, Earth\u2019s moon can allow scientists to understand the history of Earth and other rocky planets. There has been an increase in the amount of orbital missions around the moon, but they do not offer the insights and added research capability of lunar landing missions. The scientific community has reached a consensus that landed lunar missions are the most effective way forward. Although lunar landing missions offer many upsides, they also have drawbacks including the amount of time necessary to plan and develop the missions, as well as the costs associated with such missions. This is where CubeSats can enter the market and decrease the costs associated with the missions and increase the capabilities of the missions. Applications: Further scientific advances centered around space exploration, specifically, study Earth\u2019s moon to help understand the Earth and other rocky planets. The innovation can also be used by universities and other smaller entities that need to reduce costs of satellite launches.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a proprietary approach to realizing a reconfigurable computer generated hologram. This approach uses a spatial light modulator (SLM) to form a wavefront to correct for wavelength shift induced aberrations in volume holographic focusing elements. Volume holographic optical elements show great potential for use in constrained applications like augmented and virtual reality eyewear since they can be realized with high diffraction efficiency in thin film materials. However, one of the problems with volume holographic materials is that they are only sensitive at shorter wavelengths (i.e. less than 650 nm) while many applications require operation at longer near IR wavelengths. When a focusing type holographic element is formed at one wavelength and reconstructed at a different wavelength, aberrations in the reconstructed image result from an inability to match the phase and Bragg conditions across the aperture of the hologram. Several methods have been proposed to correct this problem, although none completely successful. This invention proposes an alternative approach to solving this problem. Applications include constrained applications like augmented and virtual reality eyewear. Advantages include reduced aberrations in reconstructed image, precise determination of aberrations through Bragg matching rays at the reconstruction wavelength geometry, and meeting the need for applications that require operation at longer near IR wavelengths.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a system and method used for optically positioning and linking colloidal nanoparticles using an optical tweezer. This invention allows for precise positioning and chemical coatings for linking. It is similar to a 3D printer in that it is capable of nanoscale 3D printing of objects and structures that are made of several different materials but has a much finer resolution than existing 3D printing techniques. The invention combines several tools and methods in a novel way to achieve its capability. The capability of the system to 3D print heterogeneous nanostructures is beyond any nanoscale 3D printers currently on the market. Nanotechnology is a field of science and technology that manufactures, uses, or measures structures that have some dimensions that are less than 100 nanometers in length. Nanotechnology has recently seen an enormous amount of interest and advancement (some have even called it \u201cthe Industrial Revolution of the twenty-first century\u201d) due to its broad range of applications across many other disciplines and fields. Some of these possibilities include medicine, energy, robotics, manufacturing, and optics. However, prototyping for research and development requires a lot of resources and it can be very expensive and time consuming with many steps involved. 3D printing has become popular in larger scale manufacturing prototyping due to its relatively high turnaround rates and lower costs of machinery. For these reasons, 3D printing on the nanoscale has also become a topic of interest in developing nanotechnology. The limitations to the current state of art nanoscale 3D printers are resolution sizes and being able to print with only one medium (usually a very specific type of material, such as photo-resins). The invention addresses these concerns of current nano-3D printing methods by using a system in which multiple materials (ranging from plastics to metals to biological materials) can all be used in a single print, with very high resolution. The implications of this invention would be that researchers and scientists, or even smaller size businesses would be able to prototype nanotechnology at much lower costs and higher speed than current methods of creating heterogeneous nanostructures.",

    "ip_description": "This invention provides a method for a targeted delivery of a commonly used chemotherapy drug, 5-fluorouracil used to treat colorectal cancer. A pro-drug is released within the colon to release the active ingredient. The method will allow for targeted delivery of 5-fluorouracil to the colon. Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. Patients with colorectal cancer often receive chemotherapy as a primary treatment or as a pre/post-surgery treatment for their cancer. One of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of colorectal cancer is 5-Fluorouracil. 5-Fluorouracil is used due to its high effectiveness rates against colorectal cancer. Current oral administrations of pro-drugs for 5-Fluorouracil, capecitabine and tegafur, must be metabolized in the liver before 5-FU can be released, thus, the drug is not concentrated in the colon, but rather is systematically available. This leads to adverse effects which might be avoided if 5-FU was specifically released in the colon and remained concentrated there. Therefore, there is a need for a method that allows release of 5-FU or other active pharmaceutical ingredients in the colon. Applications include colorectal cancer treatment. Advantages include targeted rather than systemic delivery, reduces systemic exposure, and reduces severe side-effects of chemotherapy.",

The invention breaks away from the traditional plane-scanning approach and implements volumetric projection imaging instead. In order to study complex dynamics of tissue in live animals, ideally the microscope needs to maintain the sub-micron resolution in deep tissue to resolve activities in subcellular structures, cover a large volume to analyze complex networks, and refresh the volumetric image at high speed to capture transient dynamics. However, despite many processes, at present there are no known microscopic techniques that fully satisfy the need for resolution, penetration, volume and speed. Applications include fast 3D subcellular imaging for organs, tissues, and other body parts. Advantages include intrinsic high 3D resolution, simplified image processing, faster frame rates that can accommodate movement in sample, large image area/field of view, and twice the photon sensitivity for increased photon efficiency.",

    "ip_description": "Novel molecular design extends the reach of iron chelators to applications in cancer chemotherapy. This invention not only recognizes the higher demand of iron that characterizes cancer cells, but also takes into account other physiological differences between malignant cells and the surrounding tissue. Specifically, pro-drugs are designed to activate into iron chelating agents within the reducing environment of the cytoplasm of cancer cells.\n\nBasic and clinical research has improved significantly the prognosis and number of treatment options for cancer patients in the past decades. Broad-spectrum cytotoxins and their unwanted side effects, however, continue to be part of cancer chemotherapy in the clinical practice. Current research efforts are responding to the pressing need for more targeted, less toxic treatment options. Such approaches are necessarily based on new or previously overlooked information on the genetic and/or metabolic makeup of cancer cells, particularly on peculiarities that differentiate them from normal cells within the same tissue. We pursue the molecular design of strategies to study and exploit an aspect of cancer metabolism that is not targeted by current clinical chemotherapy, namely the altered iron metabolism of malignant cells.\n\nIn order to sustain their rapid proliferation rates, cancer cells require higher iron content when compared to normal cells. As such, the use of small-molecule scavengers (chelators) of iron ions could deprive cancer cells of this essential supply, thereby slowing or halting cancer growth. Indeed, chelation therapy has been employed clinically for decades in cases of iron overload conditions associated with genetic disorders, such as thalassemia and hemochromatosis. The key to the success of chelation therapy in cancer treatment, however, is the ability to target iron ions in malignant cells without affecting iron levels in the bloodstream and in normal tissue. Lacking such selectivity, currently available chelators were found to elicit adverse side effects when employed in the context of cancer research.",

This invention provides a new way of smoothing the surface of a resonator so that ultrasensitive detection can be achieved, providing high Q-factors as well as reduced scattering loss, which is important when detecting key biomarkers such as amyloid-\u03b2.\n\nThis has potential application in biomarker detection for patients with COVID-19, as well as vaccine research.\n\nOptical resonators are a key component of biosensors that are used in many different applications. However, the resonator has to have a smooth surface to allow the capture of light at different wavelengths. The ability of a resonator to capture light effectively is referred to as its Q-factor (quality factor). Traditional ways of smoothing the surface of a resonator still leave too much residual roughness that leads to a lower q-factor, and thus less accurate detection of biomarkers.\n\nApplications:\n*   Biomarker detection for healthcare diagnostics and drug development\n*   Defense/security applications to detect explosives, chemical weapons, drugs\n*   Environmental biosensors for air/water quality\n*   Detection of disease in agricultural/food products\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Achieves better surface smoothness for an optical resonator\n*   Better Q-factor, longer wavelengths\n*   Better for the detection of biomarkers\n*   Validated in Alzheimer's use case",

The invention is intended to be used by rovers on the Moon and Mars for discovering the insides of deep pits that are unable to be viewed. Currently, rovers that are sent to the Moon and Mars are unable to explore the depths of pits which may contain forms of past life or water. Wheeled rovers, that are very expensive, would not be able to come back to the surface or make a safe landing, and thus need a low-cost alternative to explore these pits.

Prototypes of two durometers have been made. These plugs will come in slightly varied sizes to allow them to fit in any vessel. The World Health Organization estimates that 234.2 million surgical procedures are performed every year worldwide, with around 50 million of those procedures happening within the United States during recorded years. One of the main problems that is faced during surgery is blood loss of the patient. When a patient loses too much blood during surgery, it can result in permanent organ damage or even organ failure. Therefore, it is important to prevent blood loss during surgical procedures. Current techniques to stop blood loss during surgeries is to use clamps on the bleeding site; however, there are some sites that are unable to be easily clasped. Bleeding can also be stopped by ligation and suture of the bleeding vessels, which takes around five minutes for each vessel. This technology could assist in the ligation process by plugging the vessels to allow work on ligation one at a time. These plugs will help greatly reduce blood loss of surgery patients and are also small, versatile, and cost-effective solutions to this issue. Applications include plugging blood vessels during surgery and preventing surgical blood loss. Advantages include being small, cost-effective, variable sizes to fit on any vessel, and allowing for the ligation process to occur.",

The method in which these compounds have been derived allows for HSP70 isoform specificity. Many HSP70 targeted drugs have been unsuccessful due to the variety of HSP70 isoforms, and lack of specificity to a particular isoform. Cancer cells have an increased burden on protein quality control machinery due to their rapid growth rates and the required transforming mutations that can produce unstable proteins. This increased need has led to the development of drugs targeting protein quality control pathways. HSP70s in concert with their co-factors HSP40s (J-Proteins) and nucleotide exchange factor (NEFs), use ATP binding and hydrolysis to catch and release unfolded polypeptides to prevent aggregation and give them the chance to reach their native, functional state. Many cancers have increased levels of a given HSP70 isoform, leading to increased survival and chemoresistance, making HSP70s potential drug targets. Concerns for HSP70s drugability have been raised because of the difficulties with isoform specificity, there are 13 HSP70 isoforms described in humans. Diverse studies and evaluations of patient samples have indicated differential up-regulation of HSP70s, arguing for isoform selective compounds as both probes and potential therapeutics. Applications include Cancer therapeutics and Heat shock protein therapeutics. Advantages include High specificity and Ability to generate compounds for various HSP70 isoforms.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a novel method for phase unwrapping in optical imaging in a more efficient and accurate way. It uses unwrapping algorithms based on a transport of an intensity equation with a convolutional neural network to unwrap the phase. This novel method uses a multi-class classification process and introduces an efficient segmentation network to identify classes. This allows for a more efficient and effective method in removing the ambiguity that occurs in a wrapped phase.\n\nSystems that use modern and mature algorithms to extract phase signals tend to return phases that involve phase jumps that produce inherently wrapped outputs that result in unusable phases. These unusable phases require the phase discontinuities to be removed by a phase unwrapping algorithm.\n\nWhile there are many types of technology that involve and require the extraction of a phase signal from an input image, such phase unwrapping is a time-consuming process that makes it challenging for there not to be any errors when it is produced. Depending on the outcome of the process, the entire system can be affected. The outcome can involve thousands of individual phase wraps, false phase wraps caused by noise, or by the phase extraction algorithm itself. Differentiating between these is a complicated process and the errors can be spread throughout the entire image leaving the resulting image unusable. While there have been quite a few methods that have been developed that are used to try and meet this need, there isn\u2019t a fully efficient process available.\n\nThis technology is a more efficient process that removes 2Pi ambiguity while unwrapping at a quicker rate. It's also more efficient in reducing unwrapping errors that occurs in the current technology, which allows for the unwrapping process to become more accurate and less time-consuming.\n\nApplications:\n*   3D imaging\n*   Medical diagnostics\n*   Optical metrology\n*   Military imaging  \n\nAdvantages:\n*   Occurs at a quicker speed than current techniques\n*   Is not noise sensitive \n*   Efficient segmentation network \n*   Preprocess noisy wrapped phases",

Position-estimation algorithms or decoding methods are applied for gamma-ray interaction position localization with signals induced by scintillation photons on light sensors (PMTs, SiPMs, etc.). Many gamma-ray position estimation/decoding algorithms based on reference datasets have been proposed because they provide better positioning capability for gamma-ray interactions especially at detector edges and corners, and also filter out events that Compton scatter and deposit energy in multiple positions in the detector. But reference-data-based methods need detector calibration to acquire their reference datasets, and the position estimation speed remains relatively slow due to the excessive computations required. Thus, the current need for position estimation is for both high levels of accuracy and efficiency.

    "ip_description": "Inventors at the University of Arizona have developed oxytocin analogues which have high potency, are designed to be more stable compared to the native oxytocin hormone (an endogenous peptide which inhibits pain and promotes social connection), have very high selectivity for oxytocin receptors, and are bioavailable for brain therapeutics. These druggable compounds may be further developed for use as non-opioid pain relief, social anxiety, anti-addiction, or post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nOpioid drugs like morphine and Oxycontin\u00ae are considered to be the gold standard for managing moderate-to-severe pain, and are often used to treat chronic pain as well. Unfortunately, these drugs are plagued with undesired side effects, particularly respiratory depression, GI effects, euphoria and sedation, and the use of these drugs can lead to opioid use disorder (OUD) and fatal overdose. Prescription rates and subsequent addiction, abuse, and hospital admissions for overdose have soared in the past 20 years for opioid drugs, with fentanyl-related abuse and overdose in particular skyrocketing since 2012. Many strategies have been developed to generate efficacious opioids with reduced addiction potential, such as biased ligands, multifunctional ligands, or endogenous peptide derivatives, but none have yet been translated to clinical use. This unsolved limitation of opioids illustrates the great medical need for effective alternative non-opioid analgesics.\n\nAn alternate pain modulatory system of great interest is the oxytocin (OT) neuronal network. Extensive research to date has shown that OT modulates pain. Importantly, OT has been shown to inhibit nociceptive pathways in peripheral nerve terminals, in the spinal cord, and in diverse brain pain regulatory systems including the periaqueductal grey, the amygdala, and the anterior cingulate cortex. This pattern is similar to the opioid system, thus explaining the efficacy of OT in modulating pain. Interestingly, modulation of oxytocin receptor (\u201cOXTR\u201d) using an OXTR agonist does not induce the side effects typical of opioid agonists. Opioid receptors and OXTR are neuropeptide receptors, thus given their activities, it is believed that OT can also be used to treat opioid addiction. Furthermore, based on its activity it is believed that OXTR agonists can also be used as non-opioid analgesics. Unfortunately, however, due to the instability of the native disulfide linkage, OT is unsuitable for use as a drug. Moreover, OT cannot readily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), so it is generally not well suited for use as a pharmaceutical. Recently, intranasal delivery of native OT has been reported. However, this intranasal delivery method misses important sites of OT action in the spinal cord and periphery. While small molecule OXTR ligands have been developed, they have yet to advance to the clinic.",

The \u201cover-congestion\u201d of key satellite orbits greatly decreases their utility, as collisions become far more likely. Adding an actuated reflector to the spacecraft will enable laser ranging and two-way communication between ground station and the spacecraft, in a secure manner not currently available to RF communication systems. There is a need to develop secondary and backup systems to effectively move these satellites and perform traffic management of derelict satellites so that collision risks are minimized or eliminated.\n\nApplications:\n*   On-orbit satellites\n*   Optical communication technology\n*   Small electronic devices\n*   Government & military\n*   Commercial & private entities\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Low cost\n*   Long-distance\n*   Increased data\n*   High bandwidth\n*   Secure transmission",

    "ip_description": "This innovation is research involving the development of aptamers that work to neutralize antibodies which harm the myelin sheath of nerves. The innovation can be a successful treatment for both multiple sclerosis (MS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIPD). These aptamers will be very specific to block certain autoantibodies and can be designed to have specific aptamer panels for each patient depending on what autoantibodies they have. The current treatments for these auto-immune diseases are non-specific and only treat the symptoms, not the underlying problems of the symptoms. The technology has the potential to provide a personalized approach for patients by neutralizing one of the pathologic components of the autoimmune reaction that causes demyelination. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease which affects millions of people worldwide. The disease is one of many which affects the central nervous system and is currently without a cure. Without a cure, medical research focuses on treatment for MS and trying to make life more manageable for those suffering from the debilitating disease. Aptamers are small single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotide fragments or small peptides, which can bind to targets. One of the problems with MS treatment is antibodies attacking the myelin sheath of the body\u2019s nerves. With the amount of money that people spend every year on multiple sclerosis treatment, there is a need for a development of a treatment which gives patients the life they deserve. Applications: To offer more specific, patient oriented, treatment of demyelinating diseases not currently available with traditional medication, including: Treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) to counteract problems associated with traditional treatments, To treat chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIPD) and help protect patients. Advantages: Allows for the mitigation of pathology while minimizing side effects, Is different than many of the traditional treatments for Multiple Sclerosis, Developed at a University with a large medical school which could serve as an advantage in research, testing, and implementation.",

    "ip_description": "A University of Arizona researcher has designed a device to efficiently convert partially polarized and polarized light into light having randomly distributed polarizations, or more generally, into output light having a plurality of polarizations. The passive device provides almost instantaneous conversion of polarization, as opposed to the current methods which use a modulator that requires a signal generator and drive electronics. The novel device will be very useful for telecom, imaging, and illumination. In fiber optic communication systems, light signals are highly sensitive to polarization impairments such as polarization mode dispersion and polarization dependent loss. Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) scramblers, which operate as a tunable waveplate that modulates the polarization state of light, are often utilized to mitigate some of the problems by converting a fixed incoming polarized light into random or pseudo-random polarized light at different times. In telecommunications, the scrambling rate should be faster than the inverse gain recovery time of the fiber amplifier. The scrambler should have low cost, low wavelength and temperature sensitivity and long lifetime. Advantages: * Passive - no power required * Nearly instantaneous scrambling of polarization * Easy to reproduce in high volumes Applications: * Telecommunications * Imaging * Illumination",

    "ip_description": "This invention provides an electrochemical method for detecting and arresting corrosion at the metal-molten salt interface, a location that, until now, was difficult to treat. While many of the pipes used in transfer of molten salt are resistant to corrosion on the exterior, this technology is the first to treat the interior of the pipe. Its novel design prevents corrosion in the presence of oxidizing impurities, like oxygen and water, which occur when air leaks into the system.\n\nThe concentrated solar power (CSP) industry is a variant of traditional renewable solar energy that, with use of molten salt, has the potential to provide power both day and night. Panels of computer controlled reflected lenses focus solar energy to a central power tower where a heat-transfer fluid absorbs the energy for use in traditional steam generators below. Molten salt, with its fluid like properties and high-temperature range, is an ideal heat transfer fluid. This heated salt can be stored for power generation during night-time hours, eliminating the need for battery storage. While molten salt opens the door to new, cheaper energy, it does cause metal pope corrosion if air leaks into the system. This corrosion can cut into CSP plant costs and reduce efficiency and reliability.\n\nApplications:\n* Detection and arrest of corrosion inside metal pipes\n\nAdvantages:\n* The only technology to treat corrosion problems in the pipe after de-aeration\n* Detections corrosion and arrests corrosion\n* Optimizes impurity removal",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a new powder mixture of chalcophilic metals or others and sulfur for use in selective laser sintering (SLS), a form of 3D printing. Selective laser sintering (SLS) is a 3D printing technology has typically been used with plastics such as nylon and polystyrene but can also be used with metals such as steel and titanium. By using 3D printing we can use these materials to create ever more complex structures that can't be made through traditional methods. However in selective laser sintering, compounds don't completely melt and fuse together. Instead, the particles in the powder will bond on the surface, not always forming a strong enough structure for the given application. There are other options like selective laser melting, which uses higher temperatures than sintering or pieces can be run through a furnace to melt the material together. Both of these processes add to the costs and complexity of a making objects with a 3D printer. The technology presented here provides a better substrate mixture that, when heated, will undergo an exothermic reaction and will get hotter than just using a laser allowing the metals to melt more evenly and form a stronger connection. Applications: Substrate for SLS 3D printing. Advantages: Allows metal to better melt together via exothermic reaction, Provides a stronger connection, Produces monolithic metal sulfide structures.",

Human diseases are characterized by upregulation of different combinations of stress and/or dysregulation of stress response pathways. For example, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by elevated oxidative stress, increased inflammation, and an increase burden of misfolded and aggregated proteins, while cancer is characterized by increased burden of DNA damage, impaired DNA repair, elevated oxidative stress, and localized hypoxia. The kynurenine pathway (KP), the primary route for tryptophan catabolism, is a metabolic pathway that interacts with inflammation. Dysregulation of the KP increases with age and is linked to diseases of aging such as neurodegeneration, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and chronic inflammation. Multiple interventions that target KP enzymes or metabolites have potential to slow decline with age and improve outcomes of various age-associated illnesses. Applications include Alzheimer's treatment, age-related diseases, and anti-inflammation.

It is designed in such a way that it can filter plastics smaller than 5mm in size while returning nutrients, like plankton, back to the ocean. Every year up to 8,00,000 metric tons of plastic enters our planet's oceans where it collects in circulating currents, known as gyres, or is carried to beaches. While floating, the plastic pieces break down from environmental factors like the sun and animals into smaller and smaller pieces, some of which measure a fraction of a millimeter. These pieces are then small enough to enter the food chain where they can eventually be found in the seafood we consume. When consumed, the plastic can cause deformities in DNA and can lead to illnesses like cancer. Floating plastic also contributes to oceanic dead zones, areas that lack life because oxygen or food is being affected by something in the system. Removing plastic from the ocean has become critical to its health and the survival of the animals that live in and around it. Applications include removal of plastic from water systems and oceanic and environmental studies.
