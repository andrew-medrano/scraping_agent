For example, a relatively infrequent action may include a critical timing path that determines the maximum clock frequency of the system. By allowing that infrequent action to take multiple clock cycles, even if that action takes more absolute time, other actions may take less absolute time by virtue of being able to operate the synchronous system at a higher clock rate.

These devices often present a challenge when it comes to creating a robust alignment layer in pre-assembled cells.

A method of infusing a dye into a microcavity to produce an effective photo-definable alignment layer is described, along with a method of utilizing a pre-polymer infused into the microcavity mixed with the liquid crystal to provide photostability. In this method, the polymer layer, formed under optical irradiation of liquid crystal cells, is effectively localized to a thin region near the substrate surface and thus provides a significant improvement in the photostability of the liquid crystal alignment. This versatile alignment layer method, which can be used in microcavities to displays, offers significant promise for new photonics applications.",

The invention provides unique coatings for particles, unique particle/coating combinations, and unique methods for making coatings and/or coated particles. In one aspect of the invention, a particle is formed having a core and a coating. The particle may comprise a core having a material such as LiFePO4, and a coating. The particle may be formed, in some embodiments, by using a non-stoichiometric combination of salts or other precursors, and sintering the same to form particles. LiFePO4 may form as the core of the particle, while the remaining materials may form a coating around the LiFePO4. Typically, the LiFePO4 is crystalline while the coating is generally amorphous, and in some instances, the coating may prevent large crystals of LiFePO4 from forming. However, in other embodiments, a coating may be applied to a particle after formation of the particle to form a core/coating structure. The particles disclosed herein may have a relatively high energy capacity, and thus may find use in batteries and other energy storage devices. Other aspects of the invention relate to devices comprising such particles, methods of making such particles, kits for making such particles, methods of promoting the making or use of such particles, and the like.",

The phase difference can be used to infer information about objects in the path of the defocused wavefront. For example, it can be used to determine an object's shape, surface profile, or refractive index profile. It can also be used to calculate path length differences for actuating adaptive optical systems. Compared to other techniques, deriving phase from defocused color images is faster, simpler, and can be implemented using standard color filters.",

    "ip_description": "The use of porous electrodes in batteries improves energy and power density in various types of batteries, including primary and rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.\n\n**Problem Addressed**\n\nThe pore space in rechargeable batteries has a high tortuosity (effective path length over projected path), which causes energy density of the battery to be limited at a given power level. Current design and fabrication methods of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries involve manufacturing thin laminates of powder-based electrodes, which are highly compressed, and subsequently infused with inorganic liquid electrolytes. Although powder-based electrodes are the lowest-cost forms of metal oxide or carbon-based electrode-active materials, such electrodes have a substantial amount of electrochemically-inactive material. This invention uses a high volume fraction of electrode-active material, in which the existing porosity, which is filled with electrolyte, has a low tortuosity in the primary direction of ion transport during charge and discharge of the battery. The use of low tortuosity electrodes while also maintaining high active materials volume fraction compensates for the decrease in energy density of the battery created with highly porous electrodes.\n\n**Technology**\n\nThis invention describes a design and manufacturing process of aligned-porosity, high energy density and low tortuosity electrodes. Such electrodes are manufactured by a directional freeze-casting process that involves a ceramic suspension of solid particles in a liquid, producing unidirectional crystals. The invention also provides means to manipulate the porosity and microstructure of the ceramic structures by changing the processing parameters such as initial slurry concentration. Additionally, additives can be mixed in the ceramic slurry to modify the crystalline structure of ice. After subsequent freeze drying, these changes are replicated in the ceramic structure and lead to improved performance of the final product.\n\n**Advantages**\n\n*   Increases energy density\n*   Low tortuosity\n*   Maintains high active materials volume fraction",

The FSK modulator and the method are based on filtering of a multi-tone optical source such as a mode-locked laser which provides a comb distribution of tones. A frequency-selective component selects for transmission a subset of the tones. In various embodiments the frequency-selective component is a Mach-Zehnder interferometer filter or a microring resonator filter. A second frequency-selective component selects a subset of the tones from the comb distribution provided by the first frequency-selective component. Still more frequency-selective components can be used according to the number of tones supplied by the multi-tone optical source to the FSK modulator. The optical signal exiting the last frequency-selective component includes only a single tone which corresponds to the symbol to be transmitted.",

Applications include endoscopes, proctoscopes, laparoscopic instruments, manufacturing and medical manipulators.

    "ip_description": "The technology is advantageous in any application requiring precise controlled motion in the presence of significant mechanical friction. The joints of robot manipulators are commonly actuated by rotary electric motors combined with high-ratio gear trains (including harmonic drives). High-ratio gear trains improve the torque capacity of electric motors but introduce substantial friction that varies with position and load. The hydraulic valves used to control fluid power in high-force or large-scale pipeline applications. Precise flow control requires precise control of valve position but high pressures induce substantial friction that varies with pressure. Micro-electro-mechanical motion control systems commonly encounter substantial friction. Friction in this application is especially hard to model due to the difficulty of characterizing surface irregularities. In these applications, Pulse-Modulated control can be used to eliminate the effect of friction and thus create fine movement control.",
