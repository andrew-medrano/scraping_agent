    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCI and Harvard have engineered a new platform for diversifying antibody genes in yeast, eliminating a crucial bottleneck in making effective antibodies. This technology enables the rapid continuous directed evolution of affinity reagents for applications ranging from structural and cellular biology to diagnostics and immunotherapy. Antibodies are pervasive in life science research, diagnostics, and pharmaceutical therapeutics. The broad utility of antibodies comes from their ability to bind target molecules (antigens) tightly and specifically. Moreover, our rapidly expanding knowledge of biological and disease pathways creates a high demand for making new antibodies. Current methods for engineering antibodies (affinity maturation) include yeast display, where antibody fragment molecules are presented on the surface of a yeast cell and selected for a desired binding activity. While yeast is an excellent platform for displaying antibody fragments, preparing and delivering libraries of antibody variants into yeast cells in between binding selection steps is time-intensive and inefficient, limiting the number of binders that can be investigated. To address this, researchers at UCI and Harvard have engineered a new yeast display platform that eliminates the time-consuming recovery, mutagenesis, and re-delivery of DNA libraries to yeast during affinity maturation. Instead, antibody genes are continuously mutated within the yeast cell through an orthogonal DNA replication system developed by the inventors (OrthoRep). The resulting antibody variants are readily selected for one or more target binding activities, with the winning variants taken forward for further growth and passive re-diversification. This technology allows for the rapid continuous evolution of affinity reagents for applications ranging from structural biology to cancer immunotherapy.",

    "ip_description": "Sensors are used in a multitude of applications from molecular biology, chemicals detection to wireless communications. Researchers at the University of California Irvine have invented a new type of electronic circuit that utilizes exceptional points of degeneracy to improve the sensitivity of signal detection. The ability to detect very weak signals is desirable in a variety of sensor applications, including biological sensors (for proteins in blood or other fluid samples), chemical sensors (for detecting toxins in drinking water), and physical sensors (to detect pressure, temperature, acceleration, and frequency changes). Many standard sensors are based on a circuit whose resonance shifts when a physical, chemical or biological perturbation occurs. The invented electronic circuits that forms the electronic reading part of a sensor operates at an exceptional points of degeneracy (EPD), where at least two or more eigenmodes have the same resonance frequency. The use of EPD lend greater sensitivity to detect changes in system perturbations. For this reason, running circuits at EPDs improves the detection of small fluctuations in sensor inputs. EPD circuits based on parity-time (PT) symmetry (balanced circuits with the same number of inductive and capacitive components) must include two identical coupled resonators that have symmetric gain and loss settings. Therefore, PT circuits can be more complex and therefore more expensive to produce than the one invented at UCI. Indeed, this invention has a simple resonating circuit comprised of at least one resonator and a time-modulated component (such as a capacitor or inductor) and the frequency of EPDs in the circuit can be set by altering the frequency of such modulation frequency and depth. Suggested uses include medical diagnostics and monitoring, industrial process control, automotive safety and performance monitoring, and environmental monitoring. Advantages include improved sensitivity over standard resonance-based sensors, easy manufacturability, affordability as current sensors, simplicity using the most basic circuit that can support EPD based on a single resonant circuit with a time-varying element, wide applicability in measuring small perturbations in various applications, and scalability of components in chip technology.",

This invention is capable of more accurately estimating cardinalities while using little memory and compute, as a result, speeding up query evaluation by as much as 50%. Large databases and big data applications are important components of modern digital systems. In order to efficiently evaluate queries with the increasing scale of data, it is critical for query optimizers to determine an appropriate join order. At their core, query optimizers rely on cardinality estimates to make their decisions. This invention enables efficient estimation of cardinalities using little memory, by generating small sketches of the data.

Streaming data naturally arises in many big data applications, including network traffic monitoring, recommendation systems, natural language processing, financial systems, and widespread deployment of industrial sensors. The invention can estimate the cardinality of arbitrary multi-join queries, which allows for better optimization of complex data analysis from multiple sources.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC Irvine have identified Opthalmic acid (Ophthalmate, OA) for treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), a degenerative neurological disorder that affects 1-2% of people over the age of 60. PD is characterized by progressive motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty with balance. There is currently no cure for Parkinson\u2019s disease, only treatments to help manage the symptoms. Pharmacological strategies for treating PD depend mainly on replacing lost dopamine due to the degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra compacta. Six decades after its initial use, L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalalnine (L-DOPA), the dopamine precursor, remains the standard of care for treatment of PD motor symptoms. L-DOPA can readily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and is converted to dopamine by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). Initial treatments with L-DOPA can provide great relief from motor symptoms, but over time its therapeutic effects diminish, and dyskinesia (abnormal involuntary movements) can increase in PD patients. Ophthalmic acid acts as a novel neurotransmitter to counteract the motor symptoms in animal models of PD, with a longer duration of action. Ophthalmic acid can be used as a novel drug for treatment of PD and other neurological disorders. The use of Ophthalmic acid provides a therapeutic target for more efficient and long duration of treatment of Parkinson\u2019s Disease. Animal studies have shown that central administration of OA can reverse PD symptoms for prolonged duration. Further, OA precursor 2 aminobutyrate was able to increase and prolong motor activity when administered peripherally with L-DOPA/NSD1015. OA acts through activating Calcium sensing receptors.",

It is based on a gelatin scaffold supplemented with Methacrylic Anhydride and immunomodulating apoptotic neutrophil cells. All components have high biocompatibility due to structural and biochemical similarities to the host wound environment. This combination of the hydrogel scaffold and apoptotic neutrophils has uncovered a wound healing mechanism that acts through immunomodulation to enhance regenerative healing.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide capture and concentration (eCCC) is a modular approach that can achieve significantly higher energy efficiencies than current thermal methods, however eCCC systems have been plagued by oxygen instability. The Yang lab has developed an eCCC approach that is over three times more efficient than any other reported redox carrier-based system and almost twice the efficiency of state-of-the-art alkanolamine-based systems. Suggested uses include carbon capture from post-combustion glue gas and atmospheric carbon capture. Features and benefits include being cost-effective, scalable, three times more efficient than other reported redox-carrier-bases systems, and nearly twice the efficiency of state-of-the-art alkanolamine-based systems. Among the multiple approaches to eCCC, the utilization of redox-active carrier species is among the most popular. Several classes of redox-active carriers have been investigated for eCCC applications including: bipyridines, thiols, and quinones. While quinones have shown to be potent eCCC carriers in the absence of O2, all reported systems are incapable of operating under aerobic conditions. Since O2 is present in flue gas and atmospheric CO2 sources, practical eCCC methods must overcome this limitation. The Yang lab developed an eCCC approach that uses alcohol additives to stabilize a quinone through intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions, resulting in practical, cost-effective, and scalable electrochemical carbon dioxide capture and concentration.",

    "ip_description": "A groundbreaking synthesis of simplified nitrogenase analogs in E. coli, facilitating nitrogen fixation in a non-diazotrophic organism. This synthesis provides the foundation for replacing fossil-fuel generated ammonia fertilizer with nitrogen fertilizer generated from a bacteria that is well-studied and already used in the biotech field. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) offers a natural means of supplying fixed nitrogen to crops. Catalyzed by a metallo-enzyme called nitrogenase, the BNF process converts N2 to NH3 at ambient conditions, circumventing the problems of fossil-fuel consumption and carbon-waste production associated with its industrial parallel while reducing the nitrogen-cycle perturbance and the surface/ground-water pollution caused by the excess application of commercial ammonia. However, BNF bacteria are difficult to grow and not suitable for all plant conditions. The expression of nitrogenase in an organism that can be cultured and mass-produced in a lab is a long-sought-after, yet non-trivial task given the necessity to introduce a large number (more than 20) of nitrogen fixation (nif) and related genes into a new host. Researchers have completed heterologous synthesis of two simplified nitrogenase analogs from Azotobacter vinelandii in E. coli. One analog consists of the reductase component (NifH) and, in place of the catalytic component (NifDK), a cofactor maturase (NifEN); whereas the other analog consists of only NifEN. Both systems mimic the nitrogenase enzyme in reducing N2 and incorporating the reduced N into the cellular mass.",

These devices operate by altering the current/voltage response of the FET when a target analyte binds to a capture agent on the FET surface. However, conventional biosensors current biosensors lack the ability to detect the presence of extremely low concentrations of target analytes. One class of biosensors uses an odorant receptor membrane protein to detect the presence of a target analyte. Here, an e-nose sensor is disclosed that utilizes odorant receptors a source electrode, a drain electrode, and a semiconducting region that connects or electrically couples the source and drain electrodes. A lipid bilayer is disposed on or adjacent to the semiconducting region and includes an odorant receptor protein that is coupled or fused to an ion channel protein. The semiconducting region changes its electrical conductance in response to the presence of ions adjacent to the semiconducting region that enter in response to binding of a target molecule (e.g., odorant) to the odorant receptor protein. The sensor is able to detect the binding of a single target molecule. Because this sensor is electronic it could be integrated in the future into a massively parallel e-nose system with signal recognition based on hundreds of different odorant receptor sensors integrated onto one chip. The sensor may be used to detect the presence of target molecules present in air or it may be used to detect target molecules present in a fluid (e.g., a biological fluid or environmental fluid sample).",

For these reasons, these standardized alloys are commonly used in automotive, marine, and aerospace applications. Current additive manufacturing (3D printing) of aluminum uses proprietary powders rather than standardized aluminum alloys because previous attempts to additively manufacture standardized 5xxx alloys have introduced unacceptable defects such as cracks and pores into the finished product.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC Irvine have identified Tetracosapentaenoic acid (24:5 n-3) for treatment of age-related eye disorders such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. Lipids such as very long chain polyunsaturated acids (VLC-PUFAs) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) play a critical role in the eye during the human lifespan. Aging causes decrease in these lipids leading to age related eye disorders. Increased lipids or lipid precursors in the eye may improve retina function and overall vision health. It has been reported that regulatory elements of ELOVL2 gene are increasingly methylated with age thereby decreasing VLC-PUFA and DHA synthesis. Mouse models have shown reduced ELOVL2 activity with deficiencies in PUFA production and visual impairment. Oral medication ingesting lipids have been shown to be inefficient. Intravitreal injections of Tetracosapentaenoic acid (24:5 n-3) will serve as a substrate to increase production of VLC-PUFAs and DHA which play a critical role in retina health. Animal models using aged (18-month-old) showed improved electrical response of various cell types in the retina (ERG) with treatment. This method offers a direct, specific and reproducible way to deliver exact amount of active compound of the place of need.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC Irvine have developed methods to facilitate the delivery of a high dose, low energy electron beam or X-ray in a compact manner. The use of radiation in healthcare has a long history, with relevant applications in diagnostic imaging and radiation therapy. For diagnostics, kilovolt X-ray beams are used for imaging application such as radiography, mammography, fluoroscopy, and computer tomography. While effective, it requires bulky imaging apparatuses and the use of radioisotopes, whose accompanying logistics (production, transportation, storage, export laws) impact its convenience. Regarding therapeutics, radiation has recently benefitted from various improvements to its source. Megavolt X-ray and electron beams generated by a linear accelerator are routinely used to treat cancerous tumors in any part of the body, but again require bulky and inconvenient apparatuses. The development of compact laser wakefiled acceleration (LWFA) has paved way for the production of low-energy/ultra-high dose electrons and high energy electrons for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, respectively, without the need for bulky equipment. Researchers at UC Irvine have developed the systems, devices, and methods to facilitate the generation of a low-intensity high-dose laser, electron beam, and X-rays for the medical treatment and diagnosis of cancer. The LWFA is used to generate compact electron beams or X-rays. The resulting high dose is achieved via a combination of effects including (1) a plurality of fiber lasers, (2) a low energy (high plasma density) regime of LWFA (~1MeV with 1020~1021 electrons/cm3), (3) a high-energy (low plasma density) regime of LWFA (~1-20MeV with 1018~1019 electrons/cm3), (4) a high repetition rate of the laser (>100,000Hz), (5) targeting of the tumor at a closer distance and smaller volume, and (6) personalized therapy via optimization of fiber shape to match the shape of the tumor. The LWFA electron beams may also be used to sterilize instruments, components, and material surfaces.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC Irvine have developed an organoid culture system capable of generating three-dimensional molecular gradients. This recapitulates in vivo tissue development more accurately than current two-dimensional organoid culture systems and will allow scientists to study human-specific disease mechanisms in native tissue. Studying neurological disorders has long been a challenge for scientists due to the limited availability of human brain tissue and the incredible complexity specific to human brains. While much progress has been made using 2D human/rodent nerve cell cultures, they lack the 3D environment present in tissues. The recent development of the organoid, a self-organized 3D tissue typically derived from stem cells, has given scientists a new system for studying diseases at the tissue level. Organoids enable patient specificity (as they can be derived from patient stem cells) while recapitulating 3D tissue-like structure and function in a dish. Furthermore, they are also more accessible for manipulation and in-depth biological studies compared to rodent disease models. Unfortunately, this system suffers from poorly controlled development and exhibits significant variability in cellular complexity. This highlights the need for more effective ways of developing organoids such that the stem cells they are derived from can more accurately recapitulate native organ development. Researchers at UC Irvine have developed a 3D organoid culture system that allows for the delivery of multiple \u201cmolecular gradients\u201d. These molecular gradients are critical for stem cell-directed tissue patterning and development and have allowed these researchers to generate properly formed human brain organoids with defined brain regions such as the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. The researchers have demonstrated that the delivery of these molecular gradients does indeed result in graded gene expression throughout the organoid (i.e. high expression of gene X and low expression of gene Y on one end of the organoid, low expression of gene X and high expression of gene Y on the other end of the organoid). This bioengineering solution allows for more faithfully recapitulated, human-derived brain organoids and provides a platform for studying human-specific disease mechanisms and drug screening applications. Additionally, this culture system can be developed to generate organoids from other tissues such as the intestine and heart.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC Irvine have developed an optical detection system for SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens that features improvements in screening time, cost, sensitivity, and practicality. As vaccine availability, economic pressure, and mental health considerations has gradually returned society to pre-pandemic activities that require frequent and close interactions, it is imperative that SARS-CoV-2 detection systems remain effective.\n\nAccording to data from the World Health Organization, there have been over one million cumulative COVID-19 deaths in the United States alone. As vaccine availability, economic pressures, and mental health considerations have gradually allowed society to return to pre-pandemic activities, the development of practical and effective SARS-CoV-2 detection systems are of utmost need. Current COVID-19 detection systems (such as molecular diagnostic tests, antigen test, and viral antibody tests) are slow, expensive, lack accuracy, and are uncomfortable for users. As such, there is a need for ultra-rapid, remote (e.g. non-contact), high-throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2 that is user-friendly.\n\nResearchers at UC Irvine have developed a solution that includes (1) an intelligent mask with a SERS-enabled nanopatch and (2) a COBRA kiosk system that allows for the optical detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the SERS-enabled nanopatch. SERS-, or Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy, allows for the structural fingerprinting of low-concentration analytes (in this case SARS-CoV-2) and greatly enhances the sensitivity of this screening solution (98%; on par with PCR tests). The mask-embedded, SERS-enabled nanopatch allows for the continuous collection of user specimen, which can then be analyzed with the AI-powered COBRA kiosk system in just six seconds (compare to 180 seconds of current screening solutions). This novel screening solution will save 38 hours and up to $400 per 1,000 individuals, and it can detect not only SARS-CoV-2, but a host of other airborne pathogens as well. It also does not require human-to-human contact, with users standing in front of the COBRA kiosk and initiating the optical screening themselves. This solution is also practical in the sense that it does not require uncomfortable nasal swabs or saliva-based specimen collection.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC Irvine have developed a novel algorithm that more accurately filters raw blood pressure (BP) data collected from continuous non-invasive blood pressure sensors. The algorithm features improvements in eliminating baseline signal drift while maintaining signal integrity and BP estimation accuracy across significant hemodynamic changes.\n\nThe gold standard for blood pressure monitoring is the invasive arterial catheter (A-line) placed in a peripheral artery, but its use comes with the risk of several medical complications and is thus often reserved for the most at risk patients. Continuous non-invasive blood pressure (CNIBP) monitoring technologies have been developed to circumvent this, but they face significant drift and noise issues, require frequent recalibration, or have been shown to misperform in different clinical contexts (i.e. those with sudden hemodynamic changes in response to stress or drug administration). Wearable capacitive pressure (CAP) sensors have grown increasingly popular due to their convenient form factors, high spatial resolution, quick response times and low power consumption, but these devices are still highly susceptible to baseline drift. Since recent studies have correlated continuous BP patterns with cardiovascular outcomes, there is a pressing need for CNIBP monitoring technologies that are accurate across clinical contexts.\n\nResearchers at UC Irvine have developed a new intra-beat biomarker they coined Diastolic Transit Time (DTT) that achieves highly accurate BP estimations. The novel algorithm used to capture DTT enables single-sensor BP monitoring, an improvement from previous algorithms that required multi-sensor data. The algorithm is significantly more accurate than its predecessors (BF, DWT, and STT), particularly in instances of greater BP change when compared to the A-line (see figure). When again comparing to the A-line, it was able to estimate BP accurately and precisely from multiple sensor types (CAP and photoplethysmography, PPG) across a wide hemodynamic range (Pearson coefficients of 0.987, 0.960, and 0.980 for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure, respectively; CAP sensor data). CAP sensor collected data filtered using the algorithm also agreed well with caretaker measurements on individuals who exhibited common arm/hand movement and on individuals who walked. As the demand increases for wearable biomonitors, this CNIBP monitoring technology excels in accuracy and precision, particularly in the context of hemodynamic change induced by stressors, drug administrations, or motion artifacts.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC Irvine have characterized an electrophysiological-based drug discovery approach that offers a new modality with which to screen potential therapeutics and characterize mutations. This new level of analysis utilizes elements that are shared between rodents and humans, improving upon the uncertainties associated with rodent behavior. It also incorporates the full complexity of operations in a single assay, while rapidly specifying site(s) of action, thereby accelerating R&D for psychiatric illnesses. Encompasses a circuit based system to inform how experimental compounds, known drugs, other inputs, and genetic mutations affect complex brain operations. The technique leads to localization of action, which in turn enables description of mode of action. This will focus the development of therapeutics to an unprecedented degree. Moreover, by examining a complex system, the assay dramatically reduces the chances of overlooking an unexpected mechanism of action. The system can therefore be used to improve prediction of clinical outcomes and better characterize brain disorders such as epileptic seizures and alterations that occur with aging. Our understanding of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as depression, addiction, and anxiety has greatly improved in recent years. These disorders are complex and characterized by cognitive dysfunction, which are defined as deficits in attention, verbal and nonverbal learning, short-term and working memory, visual and auditory processing, problem solving, processing speed, and/or motor functioning. Several assays exist for the functional testing of these behavioral deficits in preclinical rodent models of neuropsychiatric illness. Traditionally, R&D efforts have used these assays to screen for potential therapeutic compounds that may rescue these behavioral deficits but poor success has been shown when attempting to translate these findings into humans. Therefore, a functional readout that is more similar between mice and humans may accelerate R&D efforts for neuropsychiatric illnesses. Researchers at UC Irvine have developed and characterized methods for using a circuit-based approach for drug discovery. These methods utilize an in vitro brain slice preparation to analyze neuronal circuit operations across the entire hippocampal circuit, a brain region heavily associated with many neuropsychiatric illnesses. Compared to behavior, brain circuit function is far more alike between mice and humans, suggesting this system would provide more translatable readouts of a potential therapeutic\u2019s efficacy. A schematic of the circuit and its key operations are shown in the figure. These operations are well-characterized across many neuropsychiatric disorders and in the context of aging, offering suitable readouts for how potential therapeutics may rescue deficits associated with these conditions. Because the hippocampus is a key player in mediating many of the aforementioned cognitive dysfunctions, this system provides an optimal brain region for drug discovery efforts pertaining to a variety of neuropsychiatric and age-related illnesses. The assay system incorporates, or can incorporate, virtually all of the transmitter and peptide systems found in brain as well as accompanying glial supportive cells. The simple readout developed by the inventors thus is sensitive to perturbations in any of dozens of subsystems. Follow-on diagnostics developed by the inventors then localize sites of action. The system thus substitutes a very broad survey followed by precision testing for the essentially protein-by-protein assays currently in use. Because the invention uses a complex system, it is more realistic than current drug testing procedures.",

This technology greatly enhances the richness of virtual fabric models and has the potential to impact various industries such as online retail, textile design, videogames, and animated movies.\n\nFabrics are essential in our daily lives and carry rich amounts of unique information. The virtual design and modeling of fabrics are important for many applications such as online retail, textile design, and entertainment applications like animated movies. Despite their widespread presence in computer-generated graphics, their structural and optically complex nature are difficult to accurately model. State-of-the-art modeling of detailed fabric structures can be achieved through volume imaging (e.g., computed microtomography), but these models are difficult to manipulate once generated. Another state-of-the-art modeling approach is yarn-based modeling, which is more amenable to editing and simulation but does not capture richly detailed fiber-level structures needed to attain realism. Combining the pros of realistic experience with the pros easy modeling (via editability) is critical for the adoption of richly detailed fabric models.\nAn inventor at UC Irvine has developed an automated modeling process that takes micron-scale fiber geometry of cloth yarns measured with computed tomography and outputs highly compact virtual renderings of these fabrics (see image). Using a variety of starting materials (cotton, rayon, silk, and polyester), they show that their algorithm can populate fiber-level structure in yarn models while maintaining editability and ease of use. Their fitting algorithm is fast, taking less than ten CPU core minutes to fit each yarn. The models have been validated by comparing full model renderings with photographs of each respective yarn, measuring parameters such as twisting, cross sections, and fiber numbers. This approach does not rely on replicating small pieces of fabric to generate long yarns and therefore yields highly realistic and non-repetitive textiles. The generation of full textiles is achieved with significant space-saving capabilities as only twenty-two numbers need to be stored for each type of yarn. This technology combines the best of the aforementioned volume imaging and yarn-based modeling techniques while avoiding each of their weaknesses.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC Irvine have used a computationally powered method to identify small molecule drug leads that exhibited anti-cancer activity in a human-cell-based assay. These small molecules and the approach used to find them will accelerate the research and development of anti-cancer therapeutics. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and over 50% of all human cancers have a genetic mutation to a protein called p53. This protein controls several cellular growth pathways, apoptosis (programmed cell death), and cellular senescence (when cell stop dividing) and has therefore been classified as a tumor suppressor gene. Thus, genetic mutations to this protein leads to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer. A considerable amount of effort has been made to identify and test chemical drug leads that restore p53 activity, with the hopes of developing these drug leads into anti-cancer therapeutics. This has been done using rational drug design followed by blind drug screening, but this method has yielded few known leads and lack mechanisms of action and drug binding sites. Furthermore, there is no current functional assay for the rescue of p53 activity. Researchers at UC Irvine have used a computationally powered drug design approach to identify small molecules that were shown to restore mutant p53 activity in a human-cell-based functional assay. The computational method (molecular dynamics simulation) allowed them to discover a previously unknown transient p53 binding site and with the use of established computer-aided simulations, they were able to computationally screen and biologically validate rescuers of mutant p53 activity with approximately 90% accuracy. Biological validation was conducted using a newly developed functional assay for p53-dependent cell killing that employs the use of a p53 null cell line (Saos-2) that exhibits uncontrolled growth. Expression of functional p53 in the cell line blocks their proliferation, while expression of p53 mutants has no effect. Identified compounds that reactivate p53 cancer mutants specifically block proliferation of Saos-2 cells expressing cancer mutants but have no effect on the growth of Saos-2 p53 null cells. This suggests that cell killing (or senescence) is mediated solely through p53 reactivation.",

This technology circumvents the limitations of previous thermal management systems by offering low-cost manufacturing, straightforward implementation, energy efficiency, and control of heat exchange.\n\nManaging heat transfer is required for many technologies including electronic circuits, aircraft components, clinical warming devices, and building environmental control systems. Building operation accounts for ~40% of the global energy consumption, with heating and cooling alone requiring ~36% of this amount. One solution to reducing this type of energy consumption is to develop a thermal management system that can be worn by users. This was somewhat accomplished by NASA in the 1960s with the invention of the space blanket, which consists of a plastic sheet overlaid with a thin continuous layer of metal that was effective at mitigating temperature fluctuations in space. Since its invention, this technology has been extended to various industries such as packaging, emergency portable shelters, clinical warming devices, and protective or performance apparel. However, one key limitation of the \u201cspace blanket\u201d material is its ability to be tuned.\nResearchers at UC Irvine have developed a novel material inspired both by NASA\u2019s space blanket and squid skin. The material contains a soft and stretchable transparent layer with an overlayed array of light-reflecting metal domains, allowing for tunable thermoregulation via physical deformation. The material is low-cost (~$0.1 USD per square meter) and can maintain temperatures between 14.5\u00b0C- 22.7\u00b0C depending on the degree of stretching, which is among the largest reported setpoint temperature window for any comparable passive material. This technology may have numerous applications in a variety of industries including food packaging, wearables, clinical warming devices, shipping, and conformable electronic skin. Overall, it combines the advantages of \u201cpassive\u201d thermoregulation (low-cost, easy to implement, and energy efficient) and \u201cactive\u201d thermoregulation (tunability) into one material, offering the potential to transform modern energy consumption paradigms.",

One of the most famous of these diseases is multiple sclerosis (MS). After disease onset, immune cells create an inhibitory environment for remyelination by a different cell type known as OPCs. Specifically, these immune cells are thought to prevent expression of sugars on the cell surface of OPCs, a process essential for their normal cell function. Therefore, therapeutics aimed at promoting expression of these sugars on the surface of OPCs, and thereby restoring their myelinating functions, represent a potential cure for these diseases.\n Researchers at UC Irvine have shown that promoting expression of these sugars can developmentally fortify newborn rodent nerve coverings or restore the myelinating functions of OPCs in preclinical rodent models of demyelination disease. They also show that in MS patients, serum levels of these sugars inversely correlated with demyelination and damage (i.e. less sugar, more damage). Importantly, this sugar is known to be highly safe in humans, with large intravenous doses (20g and 100g) in humans demonstrating no toxicity issues or alterations in blood glucose or insulin. The therapeutic is currently being tested in Phase I clinical trials and holds potential to be the first true cure for demyelinating disease like MS.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at University of California, Irvine have developed a novel percutaneous heart valve delivery system for coordinated delivery, positioning, repositioning, and/or percutaneous retrieval of percutaneously implanted heart valves. This system enables optimal placement of the transcatheter heart valve and may thereby significantly reduce the risk of paravalvular aortic regurgitation, myocardial infarction, or ischemia related to improper positioning. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures require image-guidance during implantation to successfully deploy the heart valve into the correct position within the patient's aortic annulus. During the implantation procedure, only X-Ray can be used for image guidance. However, X-Ray is not sufficient for accurate visualization because it is a 2D projection of 3D anatomy that depends on the orientation angle of visualization. Currently, other imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, or ultrasound are used prior to the procedure and during the follow-up procedure, with the hopes that anatomical visualization can be directly correlated to the X-Ray images seen during the procedure. However, differences in contrast, resolution, and artifacts can produce differing results. Correct valve positioning is crucial for treatment success and optimal outcomes after transcatheter valve implantation. However, most of the current technologies are limited by instant deployment, and once the valve is deployed, repositioning and/or percutaneous retrieval is not possible\u2014or at least difficult or potentially problematic. Placement of the stented valve in a position that is too high (or proximal) can obstruct the coronary ostia in a case of aortic implantation, which may result in myocardial infarction or ischemia. Additionally, if the valve is placed too high in the aorta, it may embolize into the aorta, causing significant paravalvular regurgitation. On the other hand, implantation in a position that is too low (or distal) is accompanied by compression of the atrioventricular (AV) node in the membranous septum, which leads to conduction abnormalities. Addressing this critical need for accurate placement of the transcatheter valve, researchers at University of California, Irvine have invented a percutaneous heart valve delivery system for coordinated delivery, positioning, repositioning, and/or percutaneous retrieval of the percutaneously implanted heart valves. This technology employs spring-loaded arms releasably engaged with a stent frame for controlling valve deployment and expansion. To control the state of deployment, this valve delivery system utilizes filaments passing through the distal end of a pusher sleeve in a self-expandable stent frame. This novel system, which also integrates a visualization system, allows optimal placement of the transcatheter heart valve, and may thereby significantly reduce the risk of paravalvular aortic regurgitation, myocardial infarction, or ischemia related to improper positioning.",

This wire mesh design enables the device to collapse and expand reversibly for a variety of uses, such as during the delivery process of the whole heart assist device as well as for allowing the device to contract and expand to physically pump the heart. Heart failure affects at least 26 million people worldwide and generates an enormous clinical and economic burden globally. Due to the limited availability of heart donors, heart transplants are not a feasible solution for most people. Many of these individuals instead use ventricular assist devices (VADs). However, VADs are mechanical pumps that are intertwined with ventricles of the heart, making them continually in contact with blood. This mechanism requires patients to take blood-thinners to prevent blood clots from forming. In addressing this problem, researchers at University of California, Irvine previously developed a whole-heart assist device comprised of an implantable sleeve that wraps externally around the in-tact heart (see Tech ID: 30542 & Patent: 11376417). This cardiac sleeve device surrounds a failing heart to assist in pumping and does not directly contact blood, which is critical in mitigating clotting risk.

This novel design enables the wire mesh to be leveraged in a variety of uses that require dynamic changes in size. For example, the novel wire mesh in the cardiac sleeve allows the device to be compressed into a catheter for delivery to the heart. Additionally, the design enables the whole heart assist device to contract and expand to pump a failing heart externally, and it makes the device easily adjustable to the size of the patient\u2019s heart.",

Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is a leading cause of mortality and exclusion from transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR). LVOT obstruction is a frightening TMVR complication, occurring in up to 40% of valves implanted in a native mitral annular calcification, 5% of valve-in-ring cases, and 2% of valve-in-valve cases. Potential for LVOT obstruction is the most important cause for patient exclusion for TMVR, with 49% of patients for valve implants in a native mitral annular calcification and 6% of patients for valve-in-ring excluded for TMVR due to predicted risk of LVOT obstruction. There are two mechanisms that lead to TMVR-induced LVOT obstruction: (1) Static obstruction occurs when the native mitral valve\u2019s anterior leaflet is pushed toward the interventricular septum by the mitral valve prosthesis, creating a narrowed and elongated \u201cneo-LVOT;\u201d (2) Dynamic obstruction occurs when the narrowed neo-LVOT generates Bernoulli forces that pulls the anterior mitral leaflet toward the interventricular septum during systole. A long anterior mitral leaflet with redundant chordae could be a risk factor which may also prolapse back into the transcatheterly-implanted mitral valve, interfering with valve closure and causing acute valve failure. As a solution to avoid both static and dynamic TMVR-induced LVOT obstruction, researchers at UC Irvine have developed an assembly of components that work together as a system for first grabbing, and then securing the native mitral valve\u2019s leaflet to a prosthesis via transcatheter means.",

Further, there are many types of airborne infections that are primarily transported through spatter and droplet nuclei \u2013 including but not limited to COVID-19, tuberculosis, SARS, measles, hepatitis and herpetic viruses \u2013 and their potential to stay airborne or to become re-airborne as a dust particle is considered a major challenge to infection control in connection with dental procedures. Even though several different types of devices have been developed in an attempt to solve this problem, none are ideal. Existing solutions lack adequate suction power, inhibit the working ability of the dental instrument, or require either a second pair of hands or external devices for holding the suction nozzles to the handpiece. Addressing this need for a device capable of effectively capturing dental spray, researchers at University of California, Irvine have invented a method/tool to evacuate the dental aerosols through the suction of these particles very close to the source. This novel technology reduces the risk of aerosol-transmitted infection from many dental procedures by limiting spray dispersion at its source, thereby overcoming the limitations of currently available approaches.",

    "ip_description": "Recently, teixobactin was investigated to treat antibiotic-resistant pathogens, but the drug has yet to reach clinical trial due to its tendency to form gels which prevents accurate dosing. To address this, researchers at the University of California, Irvine have invented a new library of teixobactin related prodrugs which show improved solubility and efficacy versus teixobactin. This invention is intended to treat Gram-positive bacterial infections, particularly those caused by antibiotic resistant pathogens. The prodrugs are far more soluble than the parent teixobactin and teixobactin derivative antibiotics and do not form gels. The prodrug molecules show stronger antibiotic activity versus the parent molecules. Increasing rates of antibiotic resistance is a growing public health issue. Specifically, Gram-positive bacteria, like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cause 35% of deaths globally. Recently scientists have discovered the novel antibiotic drug, teixobactin, which was shown to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria. When dissolved in aqueous environments, teixobactin and its analogues assemble into gels. This aggregation makes it difficult to effectively administer teixobactin therapeutically. Lowering concentrations may prevent gelation, but may also prevent adequate therapeutic dosage. To address these challenges, researchers at the University of California, Irvine have developed a new library of teixobactin and teixobactin derivative prodrugs. Upon introduction of the prodrugs into cellular cultures, the prodrug is converted to the active antibiotic. These prodrugs have better solubility versus the parent compounds, imparting improved pharmacological properties. Additionally, the prodrugs show an improvement in antibiotic activity over the parent drug. The efficacy of this invention has been demonstrated with in vitro studies.",

    "ip_description": "Noncanonical redox cofactor-based biotransformation is an attractive low-cost alternative to traditional cell-free reductive biotransformation. However, engineering enzymes to utilize noncanonical redox cofactors has been challenging. Addressing this problem, researchers at UC Irvine have developed a high-throughput directed evolution platform that enables development of such enzymes with ~147-fold improved catalytic efficiency, which translates to an industry-viable total turnover number of ~45,000 in cell-free biotransformation without requiring high cofactor concentrations. Cell-free biotransformation is a prominent tool in the production of renewable chemicals, fuels, and pharmaceuticals. Recently, noncanonical redox cofactor-based biotransformation has emerged as a promising low-cost alternative to traditional cell-free reductive biotransformation. However, a significant hurdle blocking the widespread use of noncanonical cofactors in biotransformation is the lack of efficient and diverse enzymes that can utilize them. Most enzymes engineered to use noncanonical cofactors do so with catalytic activities too low for practical applications. Researchers at University of California, Irvine have developed a simple, high-throughput platform to obtain enzymes that can utilize noncanonical redox cofactors with high catalytic efficiency. Enzymes developed with this system may become transformative tools in reductive biotransformation, as they are able to function near their maximum catalytic velocity even at sub-milllimolar cofactor concentrations. Rapid development of such enzymes via this novel platform will enable more economical and scalable biotransformation. Furthermore, a general design principle developed by this novel selection platform will lead to engineering of other noncanonical redox cofactor-dependent enzymes.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCI have developed a family of recombinant protein therapeutics against Clostridium difficile designed to provide broad-spectrum protection and neutralization against all isoforms of its main toxin, TcdB. These antitoxin molecules feature fragments of TcdB\u2019s human receptors (CSPG4 and FZD) which compete for TcdB binding, significantly improving upon existing antibody therapeutics for Clostridium difficile infections.\n\nSuggested uses\n\n\u00b7Development of broad-spectrum therapeutics for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) \n\u00b7High-affinity diagnostic assays to detect a wide range of Clostridium difficile strains \n\nFeatures/Benefits\n\n\u00b7Increased potency: bi-specific molecules that block two toxin binding events are likely more potent than a therapeutic blocking one binding event. \n\u00b7Broad-spectrum protection: these antitoxin proteins are effective against multiple toxin isoforms, including those from hypervirulent clinical strains. \n\u00b7Reduced resistance risk: the toxin gene cannot mutate to resist antitoxin binding without compromising its native toxic function. \n\u00b7Low immunogenicity: these antitoxin molecules are comprised of all human proteins, minimizing the risk of immune clearance.\n\nFull Description\n\nClostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a bacterium that causes diarrhea and colitis and is classified as one of the top urgent antibiotic resistance threats by the CDC. In the US, Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) affect more than 223,900 patients, resulting in approximately 12,800 deaths in 2017. C. difficile harms patients predominantly through the protein toxin TcdB, while many TcdB isoforms have been identified from a growing number of diverse C. difficile strains. To treat CDIs, Merck developed an anti-TcdB antibody therapeutic, bezlotoxumab, approved by the FDA in 2016. While bezlotoxumab is effective against some TcdB isoforms, it has low potency against many TcdB isoforms that have mutated to diminish bezlotoxumab binding and neutralization during evolution, including those from hypervirulent clinical strains. To address this, researchers at UCI have developed a family of recombinant protein therapeutics to treat CDIs. Importantly, these antitoxin molecules are designed to provide broad-spectrum protection and neutralization against all isoforms of TcdB. Building molecules with fragments of TcdB\u2019s human receptors allows these antitoxins to simultaneously compete with two native receptors for TcdB binding, while the toxin gene cannot mutate to resist antitoxin binding without compromising its native toxic function. Using human-derived parts can minimize the risk of immune clearance and increase half-life in serum. Overall, these antitoxins offer significant improvements upon existing antibody therapeutics for C. difficile infections.\n\nState Of Development\n\nResearchers have successfully produced the antitoxin molecules, purifying them to high homogeneity. Preliminary assays demonstrated the molecules drastically exceed the FDA-approved bezlotoxumab for potency on TcdB from a hypervirulent C. difficilestrain, while being comparable to bezlotoxumab for neutralization on TcdB from the referencestrain. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies confirmed the simultaneous binding of the antitoxin to two distinct sites on the toxin.",

This novel technology will dramatically improve optical communication transmission speed and power by orders of magnitude. This novel optical fiber technology has potential applications in optical fiber communication as well as in laser spectroscopy and optical fiber sensing/imaging. Compared to the widely-used conventional solid core fiber, this hollow core fiber transmits light faster and guides light with much higher power. Compared to existing hollow-core fiber designs, this architecture is simpler and easier to fabricate. Significant improvements in laser power: high power fiber laser with radiation >1000GW/cm2 for advanced in-fiber laser applications. Current state-of-the-art\u2019s power range: ~10 GW/cm2. Due to their ability to efficiently transmit data across longer distances, optical fibers are widely utilized in high-speed data transmission applications, such as in high-speed internet. Conventional optical fibers function by transmitting light via reflection between a solid glass core, light carrying material, and cladding. Despite the prevalent usage of these conventional solid core optical fibers, the speed, power, and transmission of light in these fibers are critically limited by the glass materials of the core, cladding, and the guiding mechanism. Researchers at UC Irvine have developed a novel air-guided optical fiber light technology that employs newly developed \u201czero-refractive index\u201d material as a guiding mechanism. This novel optical fiber technology will improve next-generation optical communication by orders of magnitude in transmission speeds for long-distance communication and time-sensitive short haul communication such as data center interconnects, high-performance computing, and high-frequency trading. In addition, this technology will lead to the development of record high power fiber laser with radiation >1000 GW/cm2 for advanced in-fiber laser applications such as laser surgery/spectroscopy, laser cutting/welding, and military applications, novel gas-filled/discharge laser (not feasible in glass-based fiber), and in-fiber molecular/gas sensing and laser break-down spectroscopy that require high peak power for plasma creation.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCI have developed a user-friendly consumer medical device capable of cleaning and removing food particles and bacteria that accumulate in and around the back of the throat. Without removal, this accumulation may lead development of halitosis (bad breath) or inflammation that may require more serious medical intervention.\n\nSuggested uses\n\n \u00b7Removal of tonsil tones and associated inflammation \n \u00b7Improve upper aerodigestive tract hygiene\n\nFeatures/Benefits\n\n \u00b7Simple, hand-held, and user-friendly design for everyday consumer \n \u00b7Multiple cleaning mechanisms combined in one device with detachable nozzles \n \u00b7Capable of adjusting to user\u2019s preferences (i.e. trigger-controlled speed mechanisms) \n \u00b7Fluid reservoir can be used multiple times with refillable ease \n\nTechnology Description\n\n Halitosis or \u201cbad\u201d breath affects 15% of the U.S. population. Some common causes include poor oral hygiene, formation of tongue biofilm, and gingival and periodontal diseases. However, some under-recognized causes are accumulation of food particles and bacteria on tonsillar tissue in the throat. This leads to tonsilliths or the formation of tonsil stones. Although improving oral hygiene through better brushing, flossing, and mouthwash usage can help with halitosis, removing tonsil stones requires further attention. Current treatment options include manual removal through physical means by the patient (i.e. scraping or picking at the affected area), professional cleaning performed by dentists, or in more serious cases, a tonsillectomy may be required. Additionally, there are limited effective and simple consumer products aimed at tonsil stone removal.\n Researchers at UCI have aimed to alleviate this problem by designing a multi-faceted device for the general public that is capable of removing and irrigating not only the tonsils but any trapped particles in the hard-to-reach areas of the mouth and throat. The compact, portable device includes a detachable nozzle, handheld compartment, and fluid reservoir. The detachable nozzle has unique features including a tip that vibrates to massage the tissue and dislodge particles, and sprays fluid to clean and rinse the affected areas. The handheld compartment has an ergonomic grip with an interface to power the device, monitor battery level, and control fluid flow rate and vibration frequency of the tip. Additionally, the fluid reservoir contains a safe electrolyte or vitamin solution with antibacterial properties used for irrigation and can last multiple sessions before refilling. Overall, the device provides a simple solution for consumers who want to improve their upper aerodigestive hygiene, treat and reduce inflammation due to tonsil stones, and prevent future conditions without the need for a medical or dental professional.\n\nState Of Development\n\n Currently, a fully working prototype has been developed and awaiting IRB approval to run pilot studies. Future plans include further developing and commercializing the device for consumer markets.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCI have developed a minimally invasive mechanism to help deliver and implant a cardiac assist device inside the body to help patients with heart failure. Successful delivery and implantation of medical devices into the body is crucial for effective and positive outcomes. Specifically, implanting cardiac assist devices commonly require open heart surgery which is time intensive, invasive, and requires a lengthy recovery period. Replacement of heart valves can require open heart surgery, however, more minimally invasive procedures using a catheter mechanism for device delivery are becoming more common. Investigators at UCI have previously developed a whole-heart assist device comprised of an implantable, flexible sleeve that wraps externally around the in-tact heart to provide additional pumping for heart failure patients. The UCI team has designed a minimally invasive, percutaneous delivery system to guide, position, release and secure the cardiac device around the heart, similar to the catheter mechanism for delivering heart valve replacements. The cardiac sleeve device is collapsed and attached to rod-like delivery arms that are contained within a delivery sheath. After making a small incision along the skin near the pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart), the sheath is inserted. Manual controls near the backend of the sheath allow for advancing of the delivery arms. As the delivery arms advance, the cardiac sleeve moves out of the sheath and expands for placement around the heart. Passive grip features along the basal and apical rings of the sleeve secure positioning around the heart; additional help is provided from active grip features and suture mechanisms that can be triggered when the device is released. This unique delivery system allows doctors to implant these flexible cardiac assist devices in a minimally invasive way and offers heart failure patients alternatives to intensive surgeries.",

Most wearable devices contain powerful heart rate sensors, continuously monitoring a patient\u2019s heart rate. Unfortunately, this continuous monitoring can take up a large portion of processing power for a wearable device and produces a file that is extremely large. One way to reduce the file size is by compression. But, the compression of data can degrade the overall signal quality and interpretation of results. Tapping into artificial intelligence, the researchers at UCI have developed a deep neural network (DNN) which allows the user to analyze the ECG signal at the sensor and preselect parts of the signal that are abnormal. This produces a file that is significantly smaller for physicians to analyze and frees up the processing power of the wearable device. Prototype in development.

    "ip_description": "The production of light olefins (ethylene, propylene and butylene) via the activation of carbon dioxide as a feedstock is a challenging reaction that requires intermediate steps and often suffers from low yields. The researchers at the University of California, Irvine, discovered a novel bifunctional catalyst comprising of Zirconium and Indium combined with a zeolite matrix to promote the production of light olefins in higher efficiency and yields. Light olefins can be used as crucial blocks for polymers, solvents, and drugs. Efficiency: this invention will provide a higher yield of light olefins (approximately 3-times as much) than current methods. Ease of use: this invention does not require an intermediate step to derive olefins from CO2. Doing so in a direct method also requires less energy to operate when compared to traditional, multi-step methods that are currently available. Light olefins are crucial building blocks for polymers, solvents, and drugs; these compounds are made via the cracking of naphtha and dehydrogenation of light paraffins. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been used as feedstock to produce light olefins either via a combination of reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS) and modified Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. During these processes, CO2 is converted to methanol, and methanol is subsequently converted into light olefins. However, these methods are known to suffer from undesirable CO selectivity and low yield of light olefins. The researchers at the University of California, Irvine, created a unique way to increasing the yield of light olefins while requiring less energy. The researchers devised a novel catalyst comprising zirconium and Indium supported on a zeolite matrix to improve production of light olefins.",

Researchers at UC Irvine have developed a new method and device to mitigate dural tears in a rapid, safe, and water-tight manner. This method can be applied to repair dural tears from spinal surgery or injury to minimize CSF leakage and other post-operative complications. This device features a collagen patch applied subdural to the tear, which is unique from current on-market collagen patch repair technology. Subdural placement and manipulation of the collagen patch will plug dural tears, leading to a \u201cwatertight\u201d seal. The collagen patch device can be customized to repair dural tears of varying sizes and in different locations, making it a diversely applicable solution. The \u201cwatertight\u201d application circumvents issues with common sealants used in surgical intervention, which have poor compatibility to aqueous environments. The collagen patch is anchored in place rather than sutured, avoiding the time-consuming and technical challenges associated with suturing. Dura matter tears are a complication associated with spinal surgery, occurring in up to 10% of all procedures. Surgical intervention for dural tears generally have good outcomes, but incomplete repair can cause CSF leakage and lead to further complications ranging in severity from headaches and nausea to intracranial hemorrhage. Common methods to repair dural tears include suturing, surgical sealants, titanium clips, and grafts from various tissue or synthetic material. All of these methods repair tears above the dura and carry risk for CSF leakage or require surgical intervention at a separate site with additional surgical time and cost.

This method comprises a unique collagen patch which can be manipulated with a specialized syringe to place the patch snugly beneath the dural tear. The collagen patch is then anchored into place and sealed to make the repair more watertight, preventing leaks and securing the patch. The patch can be easily manipulated and adjusted, making it an efficient and scalable repair method.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCI have developed a method of treating inherited retinal diseases, such as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and retinitis pigmentosa, by gene therapy of the RPE65 nonsense mutation. This method uses base editor-mediated genome-editing by viral delivery and lead to improved patient treatment through enhanced editing of single base pairs and reduced off-target genomic editing.\n\nGene therapy: This therapy can treat the inherited retinal diseases Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and retinitis pigmentosa.\n\nFeatures/Benefits\n\n \u00b7Long-lasting: Base-editing directly alters the genome in RPE cells, which allows a non-diminishing therapy that should last a patient\u2019s lifetime. \n \u00b7Precise: By using adenosine-base editing and precise single-guide RNAs, this therapy minimizes undesired insertions and deletions effects and does not cause double stranded-breaks. \n \u00b7Versatile: This base-editing technology can be translated to nearly any mutations, such as loss-of- or gain-of-function for genes of any size, since only the point mutations will be directly corrected. \n \u00b7Safe: This therapy can be delivered by AAV or nanoparticle delivery for safely expressing the cassette without genome integration.\n\nTechnology Description\n\n Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) constitutes approximately 10% of childhood inherited blindness cases, and most LCA patients have severe visual impairment and become legally blind due to progressing retinal degeneration. RPE65 encodes a critical enzyme in the retinal pigment epithelium, and loss-of-function mutations in RPE65 is one of the common causes of inherited retinal diseases, making this gene an important target for therapy.\n Recently, the FDA approved the first gene therapy for LCA patients with biallelic mutations in RPE65; specifically, treatment involves delivering a full-sized functional copy of RPE65 that is expressed in an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. Although this AAV-mediated delivery has proven to enhance visual sensitivity for the first year, LCA patients often continue to suffer further retinal degeneration and undergo a relapse in visual sensitivity after one to three years. Moreover, the FDA-approved AAV gene augmentation is limited to solely correcting loss-of-function mutations in small-sized genes.\n UCI researchers have improved the current method of LCA therapy by using an adenosine base-editor and single-guide (sgRNA) cassette. Adenosine base editing has the advantage of being more precise than traditional CRISPR editing because adenosine deaminase will directly change single bases within the genome. This newer base editing approach also reduces the chance of undesirable gene insertions and deletions because it does not make double stranded DNA breaks. This treatment approach can be adapted to a variety of inherited retinal diseases, both loss-of- and gain-of-function mutations, because the sgDNA can target small- and large-sized genes.\n\nState Of Development\n\nResearchers have tested the single base-editing therapy on in vivo mouse LCA-models and demonstrate successful correction of homologous RPE65 nonsense mutation. Future directions involve adapting the successful mouse sgRNA to human sequence and testing any off-target and visual phenotypic effects in clinical settings.",

    "ip_description": "UCI researchers developed a new device that uses electricity to drive ion separation across a membrane. This device can increase the energy efficiency of various applications such as artificial photosynthesis, water desalination, and chemical separations. Ion pumps are devices that use external power to introduce a net ionic flux. Photosynthesis in plants and the hydrolysis of ATP in animals are examples of ion pump driven processes. Although widely used in nature, there are very few technologies that can unleash the vast potential of ion pumps. Unlike electrons in electronic devices where contacts serve as nearly ideal sources and sinks for charge carriers, ions are sourced and removed by chemical reactions. These redox reactions are in many cases energetically expensive and require tailoring specific catalysts to the specific ions to be pumped. Said redox reactions are the means by which commercial electrodialysis is able to operate continuously, driving ion transport indefinitely in a single direction. UCI inventors have developed a first-of-its-kind \u201call electric\u201d ion pump based on an electronic ratchet mechanism. Electronic ratchets are devices that utilize modulation in a spatially varying electric field to drive steady state current. Similar to peristaltic pumps, where the pump mechanism is not in direct contact with the pumped fluid, electronic ratchets induce net current with no direct charge transport between the power source and the pumped charge carriers. Thus, electronic ratchets can be used to pump ions in steady-state with no electrochemical reactions between the power source and the pumped ions. The result is an \u201call-electric\u201d ion pump that is far more simple and energy efficient than any other electrochemical deionization/desalination design.",

    "ip_description": "UCI researchers developed a percutaneous heart valve delivery system to deliver and implant a prosthetic valve. This system incorporates the means to fracture a previously implanted prosthetic valve in situ without interfering with the transcatheter valve to be implanted. The human heart has four valves which control the flow of blood throughout the heart. Heart valve disease occurs when one or more of these valves do not work properly. In the US, this disease affects more than 5 million Americans each year. Surgical valve replacement can be completed using prosthetic valves. But these prosthetic valves can degrade and eventually fail over time. These prosthetic valves can subsequently be replaced by the minimally invasive valve-in-valve (VIV) procedure, in which the new transcatheter valve is tightly placed within the older failed surgical valve. Unfortunately, in some cases, especially over time, these transcatheter VIV replacement can lead to suboptimal clinical outcomes due to constriction of the new transcatheter heart valve by the old prosthetic surgical valve\u2019s sewing ring. The researchers at UCI developed a new percutaneous heart valve delivery system to facilitate heart valve replacement with bioprosthetic valve fracture (BVF). The system involves a valve delivery catheter, a balloon configured to fracture a previously implanted heart valve, and a replacement transcatheter heart valve. The key step requires the fracture to be completed before deploying the replacement valve so as to prevent leaflet damage of the new valve. Compared to other pre-VIV BVF techniques, this approach overcomes valvular insufficiency by the immediate placement of the replacement valve. Overall, this technology aims to improve treatment success and optimal outcomes in transcatheter valve implantation.",

Researchers developed cyclic compounds designed to mimic the conformation of natural Mpro substrate and bind to the sequences on both sides of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. This allows for a tightly bound inhibitor that does not require covalent bond formation with the active site cysteine and improves the efficacy.

Droplet microfluidics has been recognized as a potential means for employing smaller reaction volumes than possible on microtiter plates to reduce the cost of reagent experimentation and drug discoveries. However, to increase the frequency of such chemical testing through high-throughput screening, a critical hurdle is the challenge of efficiently converting a compound library from a microliter plate format to a microfluidic droplet format. The present invention features a device for rapidly formatting a chemical compound library into microfluidic droplets by employing an array of reservoirs that can be filled with a reagent library, including but not limited to a drug compound library. Once filled, each reservoir can dispense microfluidic droplets on demand. After the initial filling process, the massively parallel array can rapidly dispense a complete library of compounds in droplet format, and each reservoir stores enough reagent to allow many droplet libraries to be generated before the reservoirs need to be refilled. Each droplet library can then be employed for high-throughput screening in drug development. Suggested uses include drug discovery, creating microfluidic droplets, high-throughput screening, and reagent experimentation. Advantages include reducing reagent consumption, cost, and allowing for more reactions to occur, making high throughput screening with a droplet library much faster and less expensive than current practice.",

As a result, the present invention enables new types of experiments that analyze cell-cell interactions and the study of tissue biology in general.\n\nThere are various methods of patterning an interface between two different cell populations. But these methods have the issue of one cell population cross-contaminating the other and not creating a sharp interface between each other, or the interface becoming ragged and not very sharp because of the wide gap created by a thick barrier between the cell populations, which causes the cells to travel quite a distance to close the gap. Another method used to create a sharp interface is the usage of discrete plates that are first seeded with different cell types and then moved together to form a sharp cell-cell interface. However, such method utilizes a silicon substrate, which is not optically transparent and, as a result, makes the system incompatible with inverted microscopes used in most biology laboratories.\n\nThe present invention takes advantage of the elastic properties of elastomeric materials such as, for example, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). A small slit is cut into an elastomeric bottom surface of a well (e.g., cut down the middle of the elastomeric bottom surface). The well is stretched to open the slit to form a gap, and a barrier is then inserted into the slit to split the well into two separate compartments. Two coatings of cell suspensions or other particles or species (e.g., protein suspensions or chemical reagents) are disposed into each compartment. After removing any unbound species or cells from each of the compartments, the barrier is removed to allow the gap in the elastomeric bottom surface to close, thereby leaving a sharp interface between the two cell populations (or other particles or species). The separated regions are rejoined with near perfect accuracy, creating a continuous surface with a sharp transition between two different surface treatments.\n\nSuggested uses\nPatterning a sharp interface between two different cell populations to analyze phenotypic differences when two different cell populations are mixed and allowed to interact.\nAdvantages\n\n\u00b7        Provides a low-cost and easy-to-use method to pattern a sharp interface between cell populations.\n\u00b7        Improves the accuracy of the interface created, increases robustness of the interface creating process, and allows easier imaging of the interface on a standard microscope.

These procedures can usually be a minimally invasive surgery in which a catheter is wedged into a narrowed valve. Correct valve positioning is crucial for treatment success and optimal outcomes of such transcatheter valve implantation. Most of the current technologies are limited by instant deployment of the transcatheter valve, and once the valve is deployed, repositioning and/or percutaneous retrieval is not possible, or at least difficult or potentially problematic.

These deposits of calcium can lead to tissue calcification in areas such as heart valves, arteries, and soft tissue leading to potentially dangerous effects if not identified. Doctors and scientists can also preserve tissue extracted from the body (in vitro) through histological techniques for further analysis to identify cell type, biomarkers, and even mineral accumulation, such as, calcium. More specifically, tissue can be stained for calcium deposits (e.g. Von Kossa, Alizarin red staining etc), imaged under the microscope and then assessed by pathologists or by scientists for research purposes. However, many of the steps in this process require manual assessment, customization, and limited quantification capabilities.\n\nResearchers at UCI have developed a method capable of streamlining the process of analyzing histological or CT images for tissue calcification. While the upstream preparations remain the same, the downstream image processing becomes automated. Using an open source image stitching software such as Fiji software, panoramic images of the tissue cross sections can be created. The images can be characterized and processed in another computer software program, such as Matlab. Here the innovative program can record characteristics of every panoramic image such as the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) value of every pixel and its location. Based on these parameters, the program can determine the distinguishing pixel factors between calcified and uncalcified areas and calculate a calcification ratio based on the respective pixel number. A dual color image can also be created to highlight the calcified and uncalcified tissue and visualize the regions of interest.

This invention will serve as a stepping stone for study of respiratory diseases, oviduct ciliary colonoscopy and future clinical translations. Our bodies use a variety of defense mechanisms to prevent, trap, or remove foreign particles from the body. The airway, for example, is lined with small hair-like flexible structures called cilia, which help transport mucus trapped with unwanted particles away from the lungs and out of the body. The unique mobility of these structures is a key aspect of their ability to transport or \u201cclear\u201d the mucus. In individuals with damaged cilia, this clearance is impaired and unfortunately leads to lung damage and respiratory problems. Additionally, ciliary activity generates the primary driving force for oviduct tubal transport, which is an essential physiological process for successful pregnancies. Malfunction of the cilium in the fallopian tube, or oviduct, may increase the risk of infertility and tubal pregnancy that can result in maternal death. In order to better understand the ciliary activity, doctors and scientists take samples of ciliated tissue and image samples with high speed digital cameras and optical microscopes. However, there is a need for an in vivo imaging method capable of providing a real-time, comprehensive view of cilia structure, movement, and patterns for better understanding of their functions. A team of scientists and engineers at UCI have designed a system capable of overcoming these aforementioned limitations. Previously, the group developed a phase resolved doppler optical coherence tomography (PRD-OCT) system that was able to obtain lateral cross-sectional images of cilia and cilia movement in real-time. The inventors realized the need to observe the surface dynamics of cilia over time and spatially and thus developed a spectrally encoded interferometric microscopy (SEIM) system with PRD technology. As a result, fast, high resolution enface images can be captured and processed in real-time. Additionally, the integration of PRD-OCT with PRD-SEIM provides a multidimensional view of cilia. Furthermore, a hand-held, non-invasive probe with this optical technology will allow doctors and scientists to better monitor, image, and measure cilia activity in vivo and in real-time in patients with respiratory conditions.

To combat this and assist physicians in rapid and effective endoscopic placement, researchers at UCI have developed a novel device which, by a simple turn of a finger wheel, allows the guidewires to be automatically and controllably advanced and retracted.\n\nSuggested uses\n\n \u00b7Endoscopic procedures where there are small cameras placed in the body to stop, lower, or retract slippery wires containing the camera. \n \u00b7Besides endoscopy, this technology can be used in interventional radiology, or any medical procedures that includes intravenous lines using guidewires. \n\nFeatures/Benefits\n\n Easier: The Uro-wheel allows for guidewires to be automatically advanced/retracted by a simple turning of the wheel, thereby making insertion of endoscopes easier.\n\n Safer: In addition to reducing complications from endoscope misplacement, the disposable nature of the Uro-wheel housing also reduces the risk of inter-patient cross contamination.\n\n Inexpensive: Both the housing and wheel itself are constructed of inexpensive plastic, making them easy and inexpensive to manufacture. \n\nVersatile: Though it is presented here for the case of cystoscopy, the general construction of the Uro-wheel could be beneficial in any type of endoscopy which utilizes guidewires.\n\nTechnology Description\n\n Endoscopes are medical devices that allow physicians to obtain images of the interior of an organ by inserting a wire-mounted camera directly into the patient. One of the most common types of endoscopy is cystoscopy, which images the upper urinary tract directly. In the US alone, over 4 million cystoscopies are performed every year to identify UTIs, urinary stones, and even cancerous tumors. As such, cystoscopies are a critical part of many diagnostic plans. Despite how routine they have become, cystoscopies (and many other endoscopies in general) are still often difficult to perform due to the guidewires used in the insertion process. Briefly, the guidewires, which are thinner and more flexible than the endo- or cystoscope, are inserted first to establish a pathway. The scope is then inserted and advanced along the guidewire so that it reaches the appropriate destination. Unfortunately, due to their flexible and slippery construction, these guidewires are often difficult for physicians to maneuver, making the endoscopic procedure more time-consuming and prone to complications from accidental misplacement.\n To aid in rapid and easy guidewire placement, researchers at UCI have developed a novel device, the Uro-wheel, which allows guidewires to be easily inserted, advanced, and retracted by the turning of a simple finger wheel. The Uro-wheel is disposable and constructed from inexpensive plastic and can be used in nearly any type of endoscopic procedure.",

    "ip_description": "Neurodegenerative diseases are a broad category of illnesses expected to affect 1 in 4 Americans. As they have a variety of underlying mechanisms and pathologies, there are currently no effective methods to prevent or modify disease progression. UCI researchers have developed a potential treatment utilizing a novel combination of two compounds for the abatement of brain inflammation and degeneration. Intended for use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD), Huntington\u2019s Disease (HD) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Treatment of non-neurodegenerative disease associated inflammation. Features/Benefits: Broad Applicability: can be used to treat multiple neurodegenerative diseases. BBB Permeability: these compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier necessary for neurodegenerative disease. Repurposed: one of the compounds is already FDA-approved for a non-CNS condition; extensive safety record. Multi-faceted: addresses several pathological components of neurodegenerative disease. Synergistic: at the correct relative ratios, these compounds enhance therapeutic effects. Neurodegenerative diseases, while affecting different regions of the central nervous system (CNS) and inducing accumulation of disparate pathologies, have common characteristics with deleterious effects on neural cells. Inflammation, altered metabolism and energy production, and the loss of CNS health-promoting growth factors are all features of AD, PD, HD, and ALS. Currently, no disease-modifying treatments are available to target brain pathologies and help long-suffering patients with these progressive disorders. Researchers at the University of California Irvine have developed a novel approach to address shared features of neurodegeneration, consisting of two compounds with the ability to reduce inflammation and mitochondrial stress in neural cells, thereby promoting cell health and resilience to cellular damage. Importantly, these compounds are BBB-permeable and elevate levels of protein PGC-1\u237a; low levels of PGC-1\u237a are associated with neurodegenerative disease. Due to the compounds\u2019 influence on multiple cellular signaling pathways that are disrupted in several CNS disorders, this approach is a promising potential treatment for the millions of people suffering with neurodegenerative disease.",

Researchers at UCI have found that by combining a repurposed FDA approved drug in combination with a natural product, they are able to prevent cell death of RPE cells by boosting mitochondria activity.\n\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in people age 50 and older. In this disease, damage to a small spot near the center of the retina (macula) causes loss of sharp, central vision. Cases of AMD where vision is lost can be divided into two categories, dry AMD and wet AMD. Dry AMD affects 85-90% of patients and constitutes a gradual breakdown of light-sensitive cells in macula and supporting tissue underneath. There are currently only treatments to reduce risk/delay onset of dry AMD. Scientists at UCI have discovered that a combination of a repurposed drug and a natural product can induce mitochondrial biogenesis, reduce cell death, and trigger the release of cytoprotective peptides in vitro, indicating that this combination therapy may be able to serve as the first protective treatment against dry AMD.",

However, bacterial strains that are resistant to a large number of antibiotics have rapidly emerged in healthcare settings globally. In healthcare settings, patients are commonly infected by bacteria that are resistant (not susceptible) to antibiotics.  \nIn order for medical care providers to prescribe effective treatments, it is essential to determine whether patients are infected by antibiotic-resistant strains and if so, which antibiotics are effective at treating the infection. Currently, the technology to distinguish between resistant and non-resistant strains requires between 4 to 12 hours and relatively large volumes of blood or patient specimen.  \nResearchers at UC Irvine developed a device which will rapidly analyze the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with bacterial infections. This device is known as fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy device for antibiotic susceptibility testing, or FLIM-AST. The information delivered by FLIM-AST will enable doctors to determine whether: (1) the current course of antibiotic treatments is effective at eradicating the infection, and (2) there are other antibiotics that could be more effective at treating the infection. The device measures antibiotic susceptibility by measuring bacterial metabolism using single-cell microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Use of this device could cut down on the critical wait time towards treatment of bacterial infections and enable personalized medical treatments. In a broader scope, this would improve patient treatment outcomes and decrease the rise of antibiotic resistance.",

Roughly 3 million people worldwide have pacemakers. Ventricular Assist Devices (VAD), more commonly referenced as cardiac assist devices, are mechanical pumps that are used to partially or completely replace the function of a failing heart. VADs can be used for short-term or long-term treatments, and have increased in use to address a constant shortage of available heart transplant donors. A timing issue, however, arises when a patient has both a pacemaker and a VAD. If the VAD fall out of sync with the pacemaker, blood flow can be impeded, exposing the heart to additional stress. UCI researchers have developed a method to synchronize a cardiac pacemaker with a pulsatile style VAD. The VAD and pacemaker are paired such that, after the pacemaker performs its sensing and pacing functions, the VAD receives and analyzes the signal produced by the pacemaker to begin its contraction cycle. This method helps to ensure the VAD\u2019s contraction works in conjunction with the failing heart and not against it, helping to reduce strain on the heart and improve patient outcomes.",

However, the compounds that make this treatment effective and the manner in which previously were elusive. Researchers at UCI have identified two components of M. oppositifolius, mallotoxin and isovaleric acid, which they discovered work synergistically to reduce duration and frequency of seizures thus elucidating the mechanisms by which this important shrub works. This effect occurs through the targeted opening of potassium channels (KCNQ channels), which releases potassium from neurons and thus decreases neuronal firing. Additionally, when combined with a current seizure medication, this treatment increases potency of the therapeutic. This not only helps with the prevention of seizures but lowers the effective dose necessary for treatment. Suggested uses include activation of potassium channels, treatment of epilepsy, potential treatment of pain, anxiety, and withdrawal, and potential use in numerous diseases affected by KCNQ potassium channels including cardiac arrhythmias, diabetes, and anemia.

    "ip_description": "Retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are the leading cause of blindness in the elderly population. Since no known cures are currently present, it is crucial to diagnose the condition in its early stages so that disease progression is monitored. Systems and methods for detecting and mapping the mechanical elasticity of retinal layers in the posterior eye are disclosed herein. A system including confocal shear wave acoustic radiation force optical coherence elastography (SW-ARF-OCE) is provided, wherein an ultrasound transducer and an optical scan head are co-aligned to facilitate in-vivo study of the retina. In addition, an automatic segmentation algorithm is used to isolate tissue layers and analyze the shear wave propagation within the retinal tissue to estimate mechanical stress on the retina and detect early stages of retinal diseases based on the estimated mechanical stress. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive disease of the retina and is the leading cause of severe vision loss in the western population over 50 years of age. AMD most often induces drusen formation in the dry form, and neovascularization in wet AMD. Drusen often acts as an early sign of AMD whereas neovascularization occurs when excess blood vessels leak into the layers of the retina, signifying a later stage of disease. Current methods of diagnosis include fundus photography, which provides surface structural information of the retina, and fluorescein angiography, which is used to visualize blood vessels and leakages if neovascularization is suspected. For more accurate visualization of the entire depth of the retinal layers, optical coherence tomography (OCT) is used for non-invasive optical imaging. OCT angiography is also used to produce en face images of retinal blood vessels and diagnose abnormal regions. Once AMD is diagnosed, there is currently no known cure so disease management is necessary in various forms, including antiangiogenic drugs, radiation and laser treatments, and photodynamic therapy. Since it is important to slow down the progression of the disease through treatment, early diagnosis is essential. Although it is possible to see anatomical changes that occur with drusen formation and neovascularization, it is very difficult to diagnose in the early stages before structural changes are evident. Due to the difficulty in penetrating the posterior globe through the anterior eye and vitreous, combined with the need for high sensitivity and resolution, a solution that addresses the aforementioned issues is needed. The present invention proposes a confocal shear wave acoustic radiation force optical coherence elastography (SW-ARF-OCE) system that enables in-vivo imaging of the mechanical properties of the retina, e.g., retinal elasticity, where an ultrasound ring transducer and optical scan head are co-aligned. The present invention may be used for the quantification and diagnosis of ocular diseases in vivo.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCI have developed a cardiac assist device for patients with failing heart functions. The device contracts and expands the heart with the help of a pacemaker to help restore natural heart pace and blood flow. Heart failure, the inability of the heart to pump enough blood to the rest of the body, has affected over 5 million people in the United States. Due to the limited availability of heart donors, heart transplants are not a feasible solution for most people. Many of these individuals instead use ventricular assist devices (VADs). However, VADs require invasive surgery that irreversibly alters the anatomy of the heart. VADs are implanted mechanical pumps that are intertwined with the ventricles to help pump blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Since VADs are continually in contact with blood, patients are required to take blood-thinners to prevent blood clots from forming. Additionally, since VADs must be powered by external power sources, a slight mechanical failure could result in the immediate death of a patient. Inventors at UCI have developed an assist device capable of providing additional pumping to the heart without the limitations of VADs. This device is implantable, but unlike VADs, is external to the heart itself. As a result, the device does not require any modification to the heart or blood vessels. Additionally, the device is power efficient, assisting the heart only as needed and powered by an internal source that can be charged wirelessly over the skin. The device works by using a motor that is synchronized to the pace of the heart with a pacemaker. As a result of these modifications, the risk of death and/or blood clots is greatly diminished. This device provides a unique and effective solution for patients with varying levels of heart failure, including those waiting for heart transplants.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCI have developed a comprehensive platform, Polaris, for personalized diabetes management. By combining standard blood glucose monitoring with activity tracking, Polaris provides users with real-time suggestions that encourage treatment adherence and promote healthy behaviors to better mitigate their symptoms. Diabetes affects an estimated 415 million people (nearly 1 in 11 adults) globally, a number that is expected to increase by >50% over the next 20 years. About 90-95% of these cases are specifically Type 2 diabetes, which arises from the body\u2019s inability to produce and/or use insulin. Though researchers believe some genetic factors may contribute to its development, known risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include excess weight and physical inactivity. If left untreated, patients are susceptible to glaucoma, nerve and renal damage, and heart failure. Despite its severity, there is currently no cure for Type 2 diabetes. Instead, it is often mitigated through lifestyle factors such as weight management, nutrition plans, and exercise regimens. For the majority of the population, however, such lifestyle changes are often drastic and difficult to sustain in the long term. Additionally, even patients who strictly adhere to their treatment plans often experience inexplicable blood sugar spikes throughout the day. Currently, patients must self-report external factors, such as stress levels or food intake, during or after these glucose spikes to help identify their causes. In addition to being cumbersome for the patient, such self-reporting methods are often highly subjective and inaccurate. To this end, researchers at UCI have developed a comprehensive diabetes management platform which aims to provide automatic, personalized, and continuous diabetes management strategies for patients. The system, called Polaris, consists of a smartphone application which is linked with other wearable devices, such as a continuous glucose monitor and FitBit. Polaris uses data automatically collected from a user\u2019s smartphone, such as food intake, sleep, and ambient light/noise, and correlates them with glucose and physical activity readings from the other devices. These trends are used to build a personalized model for each user, which allows Polaris to provide patients with real-time suggestions customized to their unique behavior. In addition to helping users adhere to the treatment plans laid out by their healthcare providers, Polaris also encourages positive behavioral changes by providing constant, continuous, and long-term support for diabetic patients.",

Global positioning system (GPS) signals can be lost in dense urban environments or altered by a malicious attack, so other sensor-less and GPS-independent signals are needed to ensure and improve autonomous navigation. While cellular phone networks are not designed for navigation, they are abundant in urban environments which are known to challenge GPS signals.

This response triggers the release of encapsulated drugs at a specific tumor target.\n\nSuggested uses\n\nTargeted drug delivery for oncology and other diseases\n\nFeatures/Benefits\n\n \u00b7Unique and high specificity with regards to drug delivery targets in tumor environments \n \u00b7Combine material with other delivery or treatment systems to increase efficacy \n\u00b7Enzyme sensor has high thermostability, making it suitable for relatively harsh synthetic methods and storage\n\nTechnology Description\n\n Most polymer drug delivery systems release drugs in response to pH or temperature changes in the body during a disease state. Differences in these conditions between healthy and diseased environments are sometimes not large or unique enough to identify, leading to varying efficacy and accuracy of drug delivery systems. Some systems also use external triggers such as ultrasound, light, and/or magnetic force to aid in the release of drugs. However, these triggers require special conditions that may not be easy to implement in vivo. These limitations lead to reduced target (tumor) specificity.\n In diseases, such as cancer, cells utilize different metabolic pathways in order to proliferate within the body. The shift to an alternative metabolic pathway leads to the production of alternate metabolite by-products. In this case, cancer cells exhibit the Warburg Effect, a shift to the glycolysis pathway and subsequent accumulation of lactate in the tumor environment. Researchers at UCI have developed a protein-polymer hybrid biomaterial that leverages this unique cancer effect to target tumors. This material uses a thermophilic mutant lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from Bacillus stearothermophilus to sense and bind to lactate but not catalyze it. LDH and its inhibitor are incorporated into hydrogel nanoparticles through non-covalent reversible cross-links. For drug delivery, drugs can be encapsulated in the hydrogel. When the hybrid material is administered in a tumor environment, the accumulated lactate will compete with the inhibitor, decreasing the cross-links and inducing a mechanical change (swelling) of the hydrogel; consequently, this change triggers the release of encapsulated drugs.\n\nState Of Development\n\n Successful synthesis of generation 1 protein-polymer hydrogel nanoparticles. Material characterization and preliminary in vitro data collection is ongoing. Drug encapsulation and release experiments are in progress.",

This has been shown to prolong survival and promote immune response and immunological memory related to long-term survival.\n\nCancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, with almost 8 million fatalities every year. A new type of treatment called checkpoint inhibitors are used to impair the immunosuppressive environment of tumors that serves as protection for cancer cells. For example, T-cells use a checkpoint protein called PD-1 to probe for disease or infection. Tumors can have these checkpoint proteins that indicate to the immune system that the tumor cells are normal. A checkpoint inhibitor, such as anti-PD-1 block the tumors ability to deceive the immune cells, thus activating the immune system. Unfortunately, checkpoint inhibitors show low efficiency for long-term remission and often have adverse side effects. Scientists at UCI have designed a nanocapsule that solely targets immune activating cells. These researchers have discovered that co-delivery of an anti-cancer vaccine and anti-PD-1 within the immune-targeting nanocapsule increases immune activation and decreases adverse effects. This has been shown to prolong survival and promote immune response and immunological memory related to long-term survival in mice.\n\nCombination therapy has been tested in a melanoma mouse model and shown to be more effective than the vaccine alone or checkpoint inhibitor alone treatments.",

Once diagnosis has occurred, therapeutic options for both mental illnesses are greatly varied and have numerous side effects. To address both issues, UCI researchers have developed a novel way to diagnose and treat Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder by targeting specific transcription factors. Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder are two prominent mental illnesses, affecting 3.2 million and 5.7 million Americans respectively. Symptoms for both illnesses vary from patient to patient but those diagnosed with schizophrenia can display delusions, hallucinations, and negative symptoms (lacking emotion), symptoms which often get worse with time. Those with Bipolar Disorder typically will have extreme manic and depressive episodes. Diagnosis can take a long time due to the need for an extensive psychological assessment. Schizophrenia and manic episodes of Bipolar Disorder are commonly treated with antipsychotics, which often have side effects such as tardive dyskinesia. Researchers at UCI have developed novel diagnostic and therapeutic target of common transcription factors, which have not previously been associated with psychiatric disorders, whose targets are differentially regulated in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder.

Currently, 2D blood flow information obtained by echocardiography is widely used to diagnose cardiac dysfunction. While this 2D echocardiography method is useful, it does not provide sufficient accuracy for characterizing complex 3D and volumetric flows in the heart. For example, it is difficult to accurately image flow patterns in the right heart or hearts of patients with congenital defects or quantify mitral regurgitation. Some 3D PIV techniques have been developed, however, these methods are dependent on experimental parameters, making it difficult to compare results and validate the current methods.\n Researchers at the UCI have developed a new PIV method that acquires blood flow in three spatial dimensions and in real-time. This method takes sequential images and tracks particles in the medium using inherent brightness such as blood\u2019s natural speckles or with brightness from IV contrast. Images of the heart chambers are obtained from a 3D ultrasound device and are processed and analyzed to provide visualization of the flow dynamics. Two types of Echo-PIV methods are utilized: 1) multi-planar reconstruction which achieves better temporal resolution compared to spatial resolution and 2) direct volumetric acquisition which achieves better spatial resolution compared to temporal resolution. The most suitable method is chosen based on acquisition parameters and spatial and temporal resolution of the images. Furthermore, this new technology includes software that provides a framework for validating other 3D PIV methods.\n Overall, the unique functions of this 3D platform allow for real-time study of different areas of the heart, better characterization of flow patterns in damaged chambers or valves, and ultimately more effective diagnosis of potential cardiac problems. Additionally, the universal features of this technology allow it to be applied to other flowing mediums such as flow underwater where images are acquired through sonar imaging devices.",

They can correlate this measurement to blood pressure and subsequently use this device for long-term continuous monitoring. Blood pressure is a standard physiological signal that is measured at every doctor\u2019s visit and is used to monitor blood circulation in the body. Common non-invasive methods measure blood pressure using inflatable arm or finger cuffs, however, the reduced comfort of these devices make them unsuitable for long-term and continuous monitoring. Wearable sensors have offered people new avenues for monitoring physiological signals such as heart rate or temperature. Specifically, mechanical pressure sensors have been used to sense joint, muscle and even pulsatile movement in the body. These sensors can detect pulses from the radial artery at the wrist, making it potentially useful for determining other vital signs such as blood pressure. However, the current use of rigid materials and limited robustness of these sensors limit their flexibility, measurement sensitivity, and long-term capabilities. Researchers at UCI have developed a flexible mechanical pressure sensor that can be worn as a wristband to monitor blood pressure. The sensor is designed to read the pressure of the radial artery pulse. This pressure has been found to be well correlated to the arterial blood pressure. The sensor materials allow it to conform well to the skin and withstand a range of stretch and strain. Overall, the wearable sensor is durable, sensitive, and flexible enough to be used for long-term, continuous monitoring of blood pressure at home or in the doctor\u2019s office. Working prototype of sensor has been developed. Sensitivity of measurements, robustness, response time, material characterization has been performed.

    "ip_description": "Under stall conditions, some airplane control surfaces suffer from decreased or reversed sensitivity, making it difficult for typical control schemes to recover from the stall. UCI inventors have developed a novel roll mechanism, derived from geometric nonlinear control theory, which allows for pilot roll control and prevents unintentional roll motion resulting from the stall. Airplane stall is a condition in which an airplane loses lift and control when airflow over the wings is disrupted. It accounts for almost half of loss-of-control events in commercial aircraft. During stall, the mechanical control surfaces on the wings of aircraft suffer from decreased effectiveness, leading to less pilot control and ultimately making it more difficult to exit the stall. UCI inventors have developed a stall recovery flight control system (SRFCS) that ensures safe operation and recovery from stall or spin/stall situations with the aid of a novel mechanism to generate roll motion during a stall. The roll mechanism relies on a geometric control technique that manipulates both wing and tail control surfaces to generate rolling motion in situations where it would otherwise be impossible. The sensitivity of the geometric control technique is unaffected by the stall condition and can generate more than four times the roll motion of a typical control technique. The invention presents a stall recovery solution that, unlike previous solutions, is capable of operating safely near and during stall, increasing the chance of successful recovery.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCI have, for the first time, developed a method for modeling the efficiencies of artificial photosynthetic devices containing multiple light absorbers. As these devices more closely parallel naturally occurring photosynthesis, they offer higher performance than standard single-absorber devices. Solar devices have exploded in popularity in recent years due to both the abundance of sunlight and the eco-friendly alternative they offer to fossil fuel consumption. While the most popular have been solar cells that convert sunlight directly into electricity, such devices have several drawbacks which have thus far limited their widespread adoption. Most notably, electricity is produced instantaneously in solar cells which complicates the storage and distribution of power. While significant work has been dedicated to storing solar electricity, many researchers have instead turned to investigating artificial photosynthesis. Artificial photosynthesis (AP) aims to mimic the natural process of photosynthesis by converting solar photon energy into usable chemical energy. This energy is in the form of chemical bonds, i.e. \u2013 solar fuel, which can be easily stored and distributed as needed. Despite their promise, AP devices have still been somewhat limited in application due to their relatively low energy conversion efficiency limits (ECEL), which determines how much usable energy is produced by the system given the initial energy input. To improve the ECEL of AP devices, researchers at UCI have developed a novel model geometry that more closely mimics the natural photosynthesis that occurs in plants. The geometry here consists of a vertical stack of identical absorbing units, with as many as 128 layers included in the model. When these absorbers are allowed to radiatively couple, researchers find that the ECEL of the device is 23%, 4% higher than that of a single absorber. These findings establish such coupled-absorber schemes as a promising and lucrative alternative to the standard monolithic AP device. Suggested uses: For determining the energy-conversion efficiency limit in solar photochemical devices. Advantages: Straightforward: The model used here is relatively straightforward \u2013 it relies on established physical laws and equations. Efficient: The multiple-absorber geometry presented by the researchers offers an increased solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency (23%) compared to single-absorber constructions (19%).",

Researchers at UCI have developed novel CYP3A4 inhibitors, that are highly potent and more specific, exhibit fewer side effects, and are both cheaper, and easier to-synthesize than current commercially available CYP3A4 inhibitors. Inhibition of CYP3A4 has proven to be efficacious in prolonging the overall therapeutic effectiveness of a number of drugs, reducing repeated dosing and lowering costs. Current commercially available CYP3A4 inhibitors are used as pharmacoenhancers, but lack potency and are prone to causing serious side effects in both the liver and adrenal glands. As such, their utility is limited. In order to safely enhance the effectiveness of wider range of pharmaceutical treatments, there is a dire need for a class of CYP3A4 inhibitors with increased potency that are also non-toxic at therapeutic doses. UCI researchers have used rational structure-based design to synthesize and characterize two new classes of CYP3A4 inhibitors with superior binding affinity and inhibitory potency. Furthermore, the demonstrated ease of production and reduced synthesis costs of these novel compounds provide commercial scalability advantages over current CYP3A4 inhibitors. Suggested uses include as a pharmacoenhancer or booster for otherwise quickly metabolized drugs for use in anti-HIV, anti-HCV, anti-cancer and immunosuppressive therapy.

Research from the National Institute of Health has shown that people who keep track of what they eat are more likely to undergo and sustain substantial weight loss than those who do not. Additionally, several medical organizations including the American Heart Association and Cancer Society recommend regular food tracking as a method of reducing the risk of future disease. In addition to cardiovascular disorder and cancer, unhealthy dietary habits are also linked to kidney disease, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, and, more generally, obesity. Notwithstanding the benefits offered by regular food journaling, it is often a tedious undertaking. Even apps like MyFitnessPal, which automatically estimates nutritional information from different types of food, still require the user to manually open the app and search through the database. Despite its estimated 165 million downloads, which demonstrate a clear public interest in automatic food journaling, MyFitnessPal typically has only 19 million active users per month, a less than 10% engagement rate. Even consistent users will still inevitably forget to log meals on occasion, making the standard food journaling practice incomplete and even inaccurate in the best of cases. To overcome low user engagement and inaccurate recordings, researchers at UCI have developed a novel smartphone application for automatic eating recognition and hands-free food journaling. The app, which is linked to a wearable device such as an Apple Watch or FitBit, uses contextual clues such as heart rate and activity level to identify when a user begins eating. It then gently vibrates the wearable device, reminding users to log the contents of their meals. At this point, the user needs only to state out loud what they are eating, and the app automatically logs the contents of the meal and its nutritional information.

UCI researchers have developed a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system which makes use of frequency modulated continuous waves (FMCW) with several simultaneous radiofrequency tones for improved speed of measurement while maintaining robust spatial information. Remote sensing of objects up to thousands of feet away can be accomplished using LIDAR, a technology similar to RADAR using laser light instead of radio waves. Due to its reliable object detecting capabilities, LIDAR has found applications in technologies ranging from self-driving vehicles to atmospheric and topographical mapping. Pulsed lasers are necessary to allow for high temporal and spatial resolution. Though conventional LIDAR is highly accurate, it is time consuming and requires consecutive measurements to minimize error in timing. This limits the application of LIDAR to systems such as satellite monitoring. Standard LIDAR also is not capable of detecting velocity information from objects it encounters. Researchers at UCI have proposed the multi-tone continuous wave (MTCW) detection system, based on frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) LIDAR. FMCW LIDAR utilizes a continuous wave, rather than pulsed, laser, and relies on interference techniques to generate highly sensitive measurements. The MTCW technology is an FMCW LIDAR system in which the continuous wave lasers are modulated by multiple radiofrequency tones simultaneously via a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM). MTCW LIDAR is less susceptible to interference effects and eliminates the time-consuming frequency scan of standard LIDAR. This technology has all the benefits of FMCW LIDARs bundled in a faster and simpler system, extending both the applicability and efficacy of LIDAR.",

    "ip_description": "Plug-in vehicles (PEVs) have drawn interest from government, automakers, and the public due to potential for reduced environmental impact. UCI researchers have developed a decentralized charging protocol for PEVs that results in improved stability in power grid demand. One of the hurdles for large deployment of PEVs is the shortage of charging infrastructure. Studies into the development of such infrastructure have shown that the majority of charging activities occur at home with the current PEV characteristics and charging rates, due to the cheap night time residential electricity and the long dwelling time needed. Furthermore, charging time strategy has been showed to have the most significant impact on charging cost reduction. At the same time, power grid operation requires electricity demand and generation to be balanced at all times. Peaks in demand require the use of intermittent power generation techniques which are costly and more harmful to the environment while demand valleys waste power. UCI researchers have developed a charging protocol to coordinate the charging of individual PEVs with the operation of the power grid. An electricity cost projection, derived from anticipated demand, is broadcasted by the grid operator. Each individual vehicle decides on an optimal charging profile for the night, which is sent back to the grid operator for the purpose of updating the cost projection. The proposed protocol can fill the overnight electricity demand valley without incurring additional peaks. Further, by using the gap between current load and a target load to guide the cost signal, the target load can be approached in an efficient manner. Adoption of the charging protocol can potentially reduce the peak demand and power losses on the electric grid, mitigate the burden caused by the intermittent renewable power and lower the cost and emissions from the power generation. The charging protocol has shown good performance in simulations to level overnight electricity demand while minimizing money cost for the user.",

This technology is efficient, does not result in lasting damage to cells, and the device is portable. Cell transfection, or the insertion of exogenous material into a cell, is critical to gene therapy. In gene therapy, corrective pieces of genetic material are inserted into cells to repair damaged or missing DNA segments. The ultimate goal is to restore the cells to normal function. Gene therapy may be used to correct genetic disorders or to treat malignancies. Current methods of cell transfection are either inefficient or risk irreparably damaging the cell. Researchers at University of California, Irvine have invented a new method of cell transfection that is both efficient and avoids permanently damaging the integrity of the cell. This new technique utilizes a lateral cavity acoustic transducer (LCAT) to momentarily trap and disrupt the membrane of cells. This gives the cells a chance to uptake external material. If this material is DNA, the cells will have the opportunity to incorporate the new material into its sequence.",

    "ip_description": "UC Irvine inventors developed a device comprising a handheld and portable motion-stabilized laser speckle imaging (LSI) device that can be used in clinical settings to measure and illustrate blood flow maps of a patient\u2019s tissue or organs. LSI is a wide-field, noninvasive optical technique that allows researchers and clinicians to quantify blood flow in a variety of applications. However, the widespread use of LSI in clinical settings has been hindered by the bulky form of currently available models of the LSI, which some require to be mounted on a tripod. These bulky models can be cumbersome and difficult to orientate and maneuver in a crowded hospital setting. A potential solution would be a handheld LSI device. But a handheld LSI device will have difficulty generating meaningful and accurate data if there exists motion artifact and image misalignment caused by vibration and shaking of the user measuring the patient\u2019s blood flow rate. The inventors at UC Irvine addressed such problems by inventing a device that acquires and showcases blood flow rate data in real time, accounts for motion artifact and image misalignment through a stabilizer, provides constant current and specific depth of field, and is lightweight and compact. The device may be hand-held or mounted and still provide valuable data about the blood flow rate of a patient\u2019s tissue or organ. Research done by the inventors also show that blood flow data and images of the hand-held invention disclosed here was more accurate and clearer than data and images produced by a generic hand-held LSI device.",

    "ip_description": "Despite many recent improvements in dialysis treatment, End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients on hemodialysis continue to experience an annual mortality rate of approximately 20%, a rate worse than many cancers. Researchers at UCI have identified an association between increased levels of endocannabinoid (EC) in ESRD patients\u2019 serum and decreased risk of death thereby providing a potential therapy to enhance survival times for patients. This approach elevates 2-arachidonol-sn-glycerol (2-AG) levels in the patient, thereby increasing activity of cannabinoid receptor 1, which will improve survival in patients with ESRD. Variety of administration routes (oral, intranasal, intravenous, etc.) possible with formulation containing 2-AG in patients with ESRD, however, intravenous administration during dialysis sessions would be convenient for this patient population. This therapy targets cachexia (wasting of the body), which is seen in cancer patients and this therapy could be effective in that setting as well. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the United States (U.S.) continues to increase with recent projections estimating that approximately 25 million patients have moderate to severe CKD (stage III-V) and more than 450,000 have ESRD requiring renal replacement therapy. Despite the recent improvements in dialysis treatment, EDRD patients on MHD continue to experience an annual mortality rate of approximately 20%. The risk factors responsible for such risk of death have not been identified. Recent studies have pointed to cachexia (weakness and wasting of the body due to severe illness) and impaired energy metabolism in playing a role in higher risk of mortality in ESRD patients, with 75% of patients displaying cachexia. The mechanism by which cachexia is connected to mortality in ESRD is not completely known but the mechanisms are being elucidated. In this regard, cachexia has also been connected to mortality in other chronic conditions such as advanced heart failure, inflammatory rheumatologic diseases and cancer. Current data suggests that these conditions are associated with inefficient energy metabolism and energy loss which results in loss of body mass (including fat and muscle) and increased rate of complications including mortality. One promising area that has not been fully explored in this regard is the role of endocannabinoid (EC) system in cachexia. The EC system is composed of bioactive lipid-derived mediators (endocannabinoids) that exert their effects through G-protein coupled receptors. This system plays a large role in many systems including adipose tissue and energy regulation. Researchers at UCI have discovered a novel connection between the increase in the serum concentrations of one specific EC, 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2-AG), and survival in ESRD patients. Serum from a large cohort of patients showed that those with high levels of 2-AG had the best chance for survival, while those with low levels had higher mortality risk. Therefore, UCI scientist propose delivery of 2-AG as a therapeutic treatment for the cachexia to decrease mortality risk. This discovery holds a promise of improving survival in ESRD patients by elevating 2-AG levels in blood. Preliminary studies in dogs have shown that infusion of 2-AG appears to be safe and in mouse models of chronic kidney disease, increasing tissue 2-AG levels were found to have beneficial effects on metabolism and renal parameters.",

    "ip_description": "Metabolites can provide real-time information about the state of a person\u2019s health. Devices that can detect metabolites are commercially available, but are unable to detect very low concentrations of metabolites. Researchers at UCI have developed surfaces that use nanosensors to detect much lower concentrations of such metabolites. Advances in the understanding of genomics has led to the knowledge that within each person resides a unique microbial community, known as the microbiome, that encodes great metabolic and genetic diversity through dynamic sets of small molecules called metabolites. Detection of metabolites can provide real-time information about health states (i.e. glucose levels indicate diabetes, different molecules are biomarkers of respiratory distress), making them valuable in diagnosing and tracking disease progression. A method called mass spectroscopy is used to detect low levels of metabolites in research settings. This method is expensive and requires extensive training, making it inconvenient for use in clinical or other settings. Moreover, while several optical sensors for metabolite detection are commercially available, they are limited in their ability to detect low concentrations of metabolites. This is a significant hindrance as many samples contain trace amounts of metabolites that could go undetected. To address this issue, the inventors at UCI have produced nanosensing surfaces with lower detection limits using a low-cost fabrication method. These nanosensors can detect low levels of metabolites in breath, saliva and blood samples within seconds to minutes. This method generates Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) surfaces, which measure vibrational modes of bonds in molecules via light scattered from the molecules on surfaces, thus providing a molecular fingerprint. Thus, they can achieve higher detection levels with high reproducibility. These nanosensors can be applied to medical devices for diagnostics, but also have applications in law enforcement and environmental capacities. Suggested uses include detection of metabolites in biological samples (saliva, breath, blood) for the diagnosis of infections (respiratory, blood-borne, wounds) and detection of bacteria and other metabolites in environmental samples (air/water contamination, pollution, etc). Advantages include increasing detection capability by 100-fold over commercially available sensors: achieves parts per billion detection levels with high reproducibility and uses low-cost fabrication method to make disposable SERS surfaces.",

    "ip_description": "Though pain assessment is a crucial part of many medical treatment plans, most physicians rely on patients self-reporting their own pain levels. This self-reporting strategy may be convenient to some patients trying to determine whether the patient should get to a doctor, but in some situations, especially where a patient is non-communicative or incapacitated, these patients may be unable to clearly express themselves to a medical professional. As such, researchers at UCI have developed a novel device that automatically and objectively monitors a patient\u2019s pain levels by tracking/monitoring subconscious facial movements in real-time.\n\nPain tracking and management is a crucial part of most medical treatment plans, particularly in the case of post-operative and chronic disease care. Medical care professionals typically rely on the patient to self-report their pain levels, which is often communicated verbally or in writing, using finger spans or blinking patterns. Self-reporting pain methods can potentially pose problems for patients who are unable to express their pain levels clearly, such as patients in intensive care, young children, and those who have cognitive or physiological disabilities. Additionally, pain and pain interventions are largely subjective and can depend on age, mood, culture, and hospital policies and biases.\nTo provide an objective measure of pain that does not rely on patient\u2019s input, researchers at UCI have developed an automatic pain assessment tool that can replace the self-reporting method. This novel device by our researchers consist of a soft plastic mask which continuously monitors a patient\u2019s facial expressions and subsequently determines pain levels according to a protocol. The invention also includes an accompanying web application which processes the data exported by the mask, presenting the physicians with near, real-time and objective measure of the pain experienced by the patient.\n\nSuggested uses\nFor the objective, real-time assessment of patient pain levels\n\nAdvantages\n\u00b7 Continuous, automatic, and objective: The device provides a continuous and objective measure of pain and as such, does not rely on patient input.\n\u00b7 All-inclusive and rapid: The device is linked to an external web application which automatically processes the data, providing physicians with near-real-time analysis of a patient\u2019s pain levels.\n\u00b7 Comfortable and customizable: As the mask is made from a soft and stretchable plastic, it is comfortable and easily molded to the shape of the patient\u2019s face. The mask itself is disposable after each use, reducing the risk of inter-patient contamination.\n\u00b7 Adaptable: The device can be used in conjunction with other methods of objective pain assessment, such as an EKG.",

Researchers at UCI have developed a novel vacuum endoscope which, when combined with standard kidney stone ablation procedures, is capable of completely removing the resulting fragments. Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) afflicts nearly 10% of the population and is currently the most expensive urological condition for the US economy, costing upwards of $10 billion annually to treat. If left untreated, nephrolithiasis can lead to persistent renal obstruction and even permanent renal damage. Stones that are too large to pass naturally through the body (generally > 7 mm), must be removed through a different method. Uretroscopic litotrispy is one of the most common methods used to treat this condition. In this procedure, a small scope is inserted into the bladder and used to precisely locate kidney stones. The stones are then typically subject to laser ablation, which fragments the stones into smaller pieces that can be cleared by the body. Although the technique is safer (especially for those pregnant, obese, and/or prone to blood clots), less expensive, and more accurate than many other available methods, ureteroscopic lithotripsy still only clears about 50% of total stone density. Furthermore, any fragmentation that is left behind increases the risk of recurrent stones. Clearly, this inefficiency in removing kidney stones can pose a widespread and expensive concern. To increase the clearing efficiency of uretroscopic litotripsy, researchers at UCI have redesigned the standard lithotripsic device to include a large vacuum channel. The increased suction potential of this vacuum channel is capable of completely removing stone fragments. In addition to its increased efficiency, the device is completely wireless, ergonomic, and easy to maneuver with one hand. Finally, the disposable nature of both the vacuum endoscope and external battery pack eliminate the risk of infection from improper device cleaning.",

Recent advancements in the accessibility and bandwidth of optical networks have lead to the rise of optical fiber-based communications, called point-to-point optical links (PPOLs), which are used in applications ranging from ethernet systems to telecommunications and military correspondence. Like any other method of communication, optical fibers are vulnerable to a number of security threats including eavesdropping, message interception, and attacks on the network infrastructure. Though there are a number of methods that can be used to encrypt optical communications, these methods are typically impractical, complicated, time-consuming, and/or computationally demanding. Currently, there is no universal simple, efficient, and safe method for encrypting optical communications. Researchers at UCI have sought to overcome these issues by creating a novel method for PPOL encryption. The encryption here is generated from the dispersion of the polarization modes sustained within an optical fiber as this dispersion is entirely random, unique to the fiber of interest, and impossible for an outsider to predict or determine. This method will be particularly useful for resource-limited applications, where reduced cost and low-power solutions are desired. Currently in the development stage.

Synthesis of dense nanocrystalline iron nitrides is not possible by simply annealing elemental iron in NH3 at temperatures in excess of 600\u00b0 C since g\u2019-Fe4N and other iron nitrides are unstable above 600\u00b0C and will decompose. Sandia researchers have discovered that by using a two-step reactive milling process and high pressure spark plasma sintering (SPS) they can quickly and efficiently fabricate bulk g\u2019-Fe4N parts.\n\nThe first step in this novel synthesis process takes pure Fe powder (such as commercial gas atomized iron powder) and cryomills it using liquid nitrogen, producing a finer grained material with a significant amount of vacancies, grain boundaries and dislocations, allowing for faster diffusion of nitrogen gas into the iron crystalline lattice. Unlike typical Fe powder, cryomilled powder allows nitriding during the second ball-milling step with NH3 to occur at room temperature, eliminating the need for high temperatures. Finally, the raw iron nitride nanocrystalline powder is sintered to form dense iron nitrides (such as g\u2019-Fe4N) using SPS, which prevents significant grain growth and decomposition of iron nitride phases due to its low sintering temperature (< 600 \u00b0C), fast heating rate, and brief consolidation cycle. The resulting product is produced in less time and with considerably less energy than conventional methods. Additionally, through the use of shaped dies, SPS can directly create parts using a process called net-shaping, which completely eliminates the need for follow-up machining. Parts, such as toroidal and E-core shaped transformer cores, can be fabricated directly from raw iron nitride powders.\n\nSuggested uses\n\n Electronics/magnetics manufacturing\nRenewable energy\nTransportation\nGrid scale energy\nDistributed energy at the home/consumer levelDefense\n\nAdvantages\n\n Cost effective\nTime-saving\nEnvironmentally-friendly",

Currently, PFDs are one of the leading causes of gynecologic surgery. Despite their prevalence, PFDs are notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat due to the highly varied and complex nature. PFDs are most commonly diagnosed via medical imaging techniques, such as MRI and ultrasound. These techniques provide little information about the microstructure and chemical composition of the vaginal wall tissue, however, which are crucial factors in diagnosing early-stage PFDs and developing effective treatment plans. Additionally, as these techniques are expensive and time-consuming, they are not suitable for monitoring the long-term effects of PFD treatments.

The assessment methods help to guide diagnosis and surgical planning, but are timely, invasive, and prone to subjectivity. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an imaging method that uses optical light to capture 2D or 3D images from biological samples. OCT is non-invasive and can achieve micrometer resolution, millimeter penetration depth, and fast data acquisition (on the order of seconds). It has been used in other medical diagnostic applications in ophthalmology, cardiology, and dermatology. UCI researchers have developed a lung cancer diagnostic device that employs OCT from an endoscopic probe. The information gathered from the probe is displayed as a 3D image from which a physician can identify healthy or cancerous tissue. The use of OCT will significantly expedite information gathering and improve diagnostic and surgical outcomes. Suggested uses: Diagnosis and surgical assistance device for the treatment of lung cancer. Advantages: \u00b7 Less invasive than state of the art alternatives \u00b7 Non-ionizing method which avoids tissue damage \u00b7 Faster than state of the art methods \u2013 6-10 seconds vs 20 minutes \u00b7 Capable of scanning large amounts of tissue at high resolution.",

    "ip_description": "The invention is a novel delivery system providing a minimally invasive solution for the delivery and implantation of atrioventricular heart valves. Through its novel mechanical structure, the invention delivers and positions the valve accurately with no need for painful surgeries or bulky tools. Valvular heart disease is the third-most common cause of heart problems in the United States. Artificial heart valves were developed, yet implanting these valves in to the patient proves to be a difficult procedure. Recently, the percutaneous approach for aortic valve implantation was adopted, being minimally invasive, spares the patient for painful and aggressive surgeries. However, such approach still faces challenges, such as the accurate positioning and fixation of the valve, which cannot be easily achieved with the available hardware. Moreover, the bulky size of currently used catheter/prosthetic system further complicates the delivery process and valve positioning. Inventors at UCI succeeded in developing a novel delivery system that implements the percutaneous approach for valve delivery and implantation, yet with no need for bulky devices. The system includes a simple handle with system controllers embedded therein. This system also includes flexible arms extending from the shafts to carry the heart valve encapsulated in the sheath, simply controlled to constrain or expose the valve when required. Through an innovative structure of extendable shafts, flexible operating arms, and a controllable sheath system, the heart valve can be now be accurately delivered, positioned or even re-positioned with high precision and less pain.",

The modified curette provides the operator with better real time insight and information regarding the tooth and root anatomy for accurate evaluation as well as procedure planning and therapy.

Unfortunately, the most popular technique currently being used is the tactile feedback which offers no information considering the root microanatomy, the appropriate end point for non-surgical periodontal therapy or even prophylactic procedures. Visual inspection of the tooth root and pocket is a preferred means of diagnostic, yet not currently practical due to the lack of precise and handy equipment. Inventors at UCI created a compact illuminated curette that provides the ability to visualize precisely the tooth microanatomy on a real-time basis. Through the means of an illuminating source and a miniature camera, both encapsulated in a modified compact curette, clear view of the tooth root surface as well as the interior pocket are made available.

This technology is a micro-patterned plate of a gel and solid wall. The micro-patterned plate provides a platform for high speed and is an efficient method for isolating subsets of biological or chemical materials. In addition, isolated subsets of samples from a larger population of samples is possible because cells may be removed from the patterned plate through a laser pulse or other mechanical forces. Conventional technologies all have shortcomings, which include difficulty releasing arrayed samples. Only the micro-bubble plate allows for the release of arrayed samples. The surface properties of the walls can be made to repel or attract to proteins. A plate is prepared containing an array of micro-pallets, and the plate is placed in a solution with cells in suspension. These cells will sink to the surface. Some will fall on the micro-pallet surfaces, where they will stick and grow. Then the solution is washed and replaced with a buffer. Cells that have stuck to the walls will remain, and the cells that are left will be removed. The result is a palette with cells in a patterned formation for study.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCI have developed a fully integrated sample mount for the simultaneous high-resolution imaging and electronic and optical characterization of thin film devices. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful technique which uses a beam of electrons, instead of light, to image a specimen. As such, TEM is capable of resolving objects that are over a thousand times smaller than those resolvable under standard light microscopes (~0.2 nm vs 200 nm, respectively). This high resolution has made TEM an indispensable characterization tool across a wide range of fields \u2013 in fact, the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for developments in cryo-electron microscopy of biomolecular samples. One of the more common applications of TEM is in the characterization of electronic and photovoltaic devices, such as thin film sensors and solar cells. As recent advances in fabrication techniques have allowed for the miniaturization of such devices, the high-resolution imaging afforded by the TEM makes it an ideal candidate for probing micro- and nano-scopic layers and boundaries. Such aspects can shed light into device functionality and efficiency. To fully characterize these devices, however, their electronic and/or photovoltaic responses must also be determined. Ideally, such measurements should be done in situ on the fully intact device and in conjunction with TEM imaging. Such an experiment would require a highly specialized TEM sample holder which is compatible with a variety of sample types and allows for simultaneous electronic and photovoltaic measurements. To this end, researchers at UCI have developed an integrated platform to meet these needs. The device consists of a double-tilt TEM holder, which contains and electric probe and embedded fiber optic cable. The probe allows an electric bias to be applied to the sample for electronic measurements, such as scanning tunneling microscopy. The fiber optic connects to an external light source and photodetector, for photovoltaic characterization via cathodoluminescence experiments. Unlike other similar TEM stages on the market, this holder is compatible with a variety of sample geometries, including thin films, and allows for precise control of both the stage and electric probe positioning. Suggested uses For the in situ imaging and electronic/optical characterization of electronic and photovoltaic devices. Advantages Multifunctional: The sample holder is fully integrated, and provides simultaneous high resolution imaging as well as electronic and optical characterization of a sample. Precise: The positioning of both the TEM sample stage and the electronic probe can be precisely controlled. Universal: Unlike other in situ TEM holders, the double-tilt control afforded by the proposed technology makes it highly compatible with a number of sample geometries, including ubiquitous thin film devices.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCI have developed a compact device for the rapid desalination of water which is driven entirely by renewable solar energy. Irrigated agriculture, which comprises 40% of the world\u2019s food supplies and accounts for 17% of the cultivated crop land in the US alone, is highly dependent on the quality and supply of the water source utilized. Though freshwater sources have historically been heavily utilized in irrigation, their dwindling abundance in recent decades has forced agriculturists to turn to other water sources such as agricultural runoff, well water, and brackish streams. Despite their prevalence and convenience, these sources are more saline than fresh water, limiting the types of crops they can be used to irrigate. Salt that accumulates in the root most modern plants can lead to wilting, de-coloration, waxy buildup, and eventual loss in yield. In order to use naturally-occurring saline sources as sustainable irrigation sources, then, they first must be desalinated to lower their ionic concentrations to within levels safe for the plant of interest. Standard desalination techniques, such as reverse osmosis and solar distillation, are slow, expensive, and require large and expensive equipment to operate, limiting their application in more rural areas. To this end, researchers at UCI have developed a novel method for the desalination of brackish (and other moderately ionic sources) water using a device that is desirably portable, rapid, and entirely solar powered. The device uses sunlight-generated current to selectively drive salt ions through a series of membranes, which desalinates the source water. In addition, unlike standard techniques, this device is uniquely driven by a renewable energy source, which can achieve desalination at rates over 2.5 times faster than competing technologies. Suggested uses: For the solar-powered water deionization/desalination by dialysis. Advantages: \u00b7 Portable: Unlike other state-of-the-art, this device is relatively small and therefore easily distributed to remote locations where brackish water is often found. \u00b7 Inexpensive: The lack of external equipment makes this device less expensive than standard methods. \u00b7 Rapid: Given appropriate salt membranes, this technology could achieve water desalination at rates >2.5 times faster than current state-of-the-art solar distillation techniques. \u00b7 Renewable: Unlike other devices, which rely on non-renewable sources of energy to drive desalination, this device utilizes renewable sunlight.",

This technology would alleviate SCI patient\u2019s dependence on wheel chairs, reducing the risk of secondary medical complications that account for an estimated $50 billion/year in healthcare costs. Patients with spinal cord injury suffer the inability to control their lower extremities, most importantly, the ability to walk on their own. To manage an independent lifestyle, patients can utilize a wheel chair for mobility. Unfortunately, prolonged wheel chair usage can cause pressure ulcers, blood clots and affect patient metabolism. Cap-based electroencephalogram, a minimally invasive cap device worn over the skull that measures brain electrical activity to control a prosthesis, has been suggested as an alternative to wheel chairs. Despite their utility, minimally invasive brain control prosthesis system hold many limitations. Cap-based electroenecephalograms have a limited ability to map specific brain signals to prosthesis motion, are cumbersome to put on, and are not aesthetically pleasing. Therefore, there exists a need for a precise and socially acceptable form of brain-controlled prosthetic interface to alleviate spinal cord injury patients from the social and secondary health problems associated with prolonged wheel chair usage.

This technology has important applications in health and behavior monitoring, where it can be used to signal the early stages of various diseases and disorders.\n\nPersonalized daily activity chronicles, which present an organized break down of a person\u2019s daily activities, have been an area of active thought and research since their first description in 1945. Such chronicles can shed significant insight into an individual\u2019s health and behavior, and may even provide early indicators of physical or mental health disorders. Recent advances in inbuilt sensors (cameras, microphones, location trackers) of modern day smartphones have opened up new possibilities for continuous, unobtrusive monitoring of a person\u2019s activities. Methods that utilize smartphone activity, called \u201ccontext aware\u201d approaches, harness data collected from existing applications, tracking events such as \u201cwalking\u201d, \u201cdriving\u201d, \u201csocial media use\u201d, \u201ctexting\u201d, etc. To truly understand a person\u2019s activities, these events must be interpreted into higher-order and more meaningful \u201cdaily activities\u201d, which include more specialized classifications such as \u201ccommuting to work\u201d, \u201cworking\u201d, \u201csocializing\u201d, \u201crelaxing\u201d, etc. Currently, there are limited comprehensive methods for collecting and analyzing data recorded via smartphone use, and translating this data into meaningful daily activities.\nResearchers at UCI have recently developed an integrated method to address this need. The application collects user data from various smartphone sensors and applications, which are synchronized within the application to track simple events (e.g., walking, sitting, texting). A novel context aware framework, called Bagging Formal Concept Analysis (BFCA), then translates this raw data into meaningful activities (e.g., commuting, working, socializing). These activities, organized into a personal daily chronicle, allow users to track things like productivity, physical activity, and social interactions within a given day. Additionally, comparison of these trends over time can serve as a useful indicator of changes to health, such as the onset of depression (increased sleep and decreased socialization) or diabetes (increased bathroom use).\n\nSuggested uses\n\nPersonalized health monitoring.\nHuman subjects research in the fields of psychology, physiology, medicine\n\nAdvantages\n\nUnobtrusive: Data is collected automatically from all sensors and applications in a smartphone, without any user intervention or action required.\nObjective: Unlike other methods which rely on users self-reporting their activities, this method relies entirely on data collected from a user\u2019s phone use and thereby provides an objective chronicle.\nUbiquitous: This technology utilizes an incredibly common device, and requires no additional equipment beyond a standard smartphone. In the US alone, nearly 70% of citizens own and regularly use smartphones.\nNon-disruptive: Data collection and interpretation happens entirely within the application, and so does not intervene with a user\u2019s natural life patterns.",

Technology is undergoing major developments, moving towards real-time high quality application.

    "ip_description": "Clinical treatment for scar-less wound healing remains a highly desired, yet unmet need. UCI researchers have developed a method to minimize scarring during wound healing through cellular reprograming that encourages formation of new skin fat cells. This novel therapy is non-surgical and applicable to multiple types of scars and aging skin. Skin wound healing is a multi-step process that culminates with the formation of scar tissue. Sometimes, wound repair pathways can go awry, resulting in benign overgrowths, called keloids. No single therapy is available for reducing keloids, and surgery to remove them comes with a chance of regression and further undesirable scarring. To address this issue, UCI researchers considered what was missing from typical skin scars: fat cells, aka adipocytes. Proposing that adipocytes may have a larger role in healing, they developed a unique composition of signaling factors to supplement healing wounds and promote regeneration of new skin adipose tissue. Applying this treatment to myofibroblasts, a major cellular component of scars, can alter their fate to become adipocytes; consequently, these reprogrammed cells decrease pathologic scarring and leave the skin surface smoother and more attractive. This novel discovery of how to reprogram scar-forming cells into new healthy skin cell types paves the way for scar-less wound healing and scar reduction. This non-surgical treatment is applicable not only to keloids, but other wound healing abnormalities, such as hypertrophic and atrophic scars, as well as skin aging.",

The code that needs to be executed is usually either completely translated beforehand (ahead of time compilation) or immediately executed without pre-translation (interpretation). Just-in-time compilation combines both and receives some of the benefits and drawback of both. It has the increased execution speed of compilation and flexibility of interpretation. One drawback, which has become a security concern, is the predictability of just-in-time compilers which has made them susceptible to JIT spraying and code reuse attacks.\nUCI researchers have developed librando, a binary rewriting library that hardens JIT compilers, and generally any software that generates new code at run-time, against these attacks. Librando supports randomization of code from a just-in-time compiler without requiring any internal changes to the compiler, making it easily and quickly portable to existing systems. The system can be implemented immediately at a performance cost, while developers work to integrate librando into the compiler to boost performance.

Thermosets are a family of plastics characterized by their strength, chemical inertness, and high thermal stability. As such, they have found use in products ranging from electronics to mattresses and automobiles. Thermosets are formed by heating viscous prepolymers \u2013 the high temperatures cause the polymers to irreversibly cross-link, solidifying into insoluble, impenetrable networks. Though these cross-linked networks afford thermosets their great mechanical durability, it also prevents them from being recycled or remolded into new shapes. Efforts to combat this typically involve introducing other, more flexible polymers into the thermoset linkages to form what are called \u201cvitrimers\u201d. Unfortunately, the increased flexibility displayed in vitrimers often comes at the cost of drastically reduced thermal stability. Recently, researchers at UCI have circumvented these thermal shortcomings through use of siloxane. In addition to being inexpensive, siloxane is easily inserted into the thermoset linkages, creating a new class of vitrimer that has high flexibility while retaining its mechanical and thermal stability.

UCI researchers have developed a new class of concrete materials with extraordinarily high damage tolerance and improved properties for long-term health monitoring. Concrete is the most heavily consumed manmade material on earth. It is used in all modern infrastructure, making the integrity and durability very important. Concrete is naturally quasi-brittle, being susceptible to cracking and fracture failure under combined mechanical loads and environmental effects.

MSC is formulated to produce distributed microcracking under strain that maintain structural integrity, rather than localized fractures which weaken the concrete. The microcracks have another crucial role in self-sensing, as they produce measurable change in the electrical properties of the concrete. As a result, simple and inexpensive electrical measurements can be used to probe the health of the concrete structure. The durability and self-sensing properties of MSC can significantly reduce the long-term costs of monitoring and repairing essential infrastructure.",

UCI inventors have developed a wireless communication system architecture that, by using reconfigurable antennas, improves the data throughput capacity and lowers implementation cost and complexity for MIMO communication systems.\n\nMIMO communications systems are capable of providing high-speed, high-quality wireless communications. A traditional MIMO system requires multiple physical antennas, posing a major challenge to the adoption of such systems in mobile devices. Reconfigurable antennas are a promising way to eliminate the need for multiple antennas, by using a single antenna capable of altering its radiation pattern, operating frequency and/or polarization characteristics. State of the art MIMO systems have only been able to implement reconfigurable antennas on the receiver side.\nUCI inventors have reduced the cost, power consumption, and implementation complexity of current MIMO systems by developing a general case which employs the reconfigurable antennas at both the transmitter and receiver. By employing a state-switching scheme at the transmitter and a state-selection scheme at the receiver, efficiency and performance of the MIMO system are enhanced. Average signal to noise ratio (SNR) is enhanced while achieving maximum diversity gains, an improvement upon wireless communication in existing and next generation systems.\n\nSuggested uses\n\nImplementation of reconfigurable antennas into MIMO communications systems where small form factor, low power consumption, and hardware cost are important\n\nAdvantages\n\nDecreases the required size of antenna arrays for space-sensitive devices\nReduces cost of MIMO implementation by using less radio frequency (RF) hardware on both transmitter and receiver sides\nProvides superior reliability and efficiency when compared to traditional MIMO systems",

    "ip_description": "Fabricating materials from naturally occurring proteins that are inherently biocompatible enables the resulting material to be easily integrated with many downstream applications, ranging from batteries to transistors. In addition, protein-based materials are also advantageous because they can be physically tuned and specifically functionalized. Inventors have developed protein-based material from structural proteins such as reflectins found in cephalopods, a molluscan class that includes cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. In a space dominated by artificial, man-made proton-conducting materials, this material is derived from naturally occurring proteins. A wide variety of modern day devices, ranging from batteries to transistors, rely on the transport of protons. Scientists and engineers have come up with many artificial, man-made materials, ranging from ceramic oxides to metal-organic frameworks, to continuously develop and enhance these devices. However, there remains an untapped potential as proton conductors derived from naturally occurring proteins have generally received little attention. The inventors have utilized Proton-Conducting Cephalopod Proteins (\u201cPCCPs\u201d), to fabricate a proton-conducting material. PCCP\u2019s encompass native cephalopod proteins, such as reflectins, and also their variants. This technology is versatile because genetic engineering methods can be applied to modify the proteins, enabling electrical properties of the resulting material to be tuned to different specifications. Suggested uses include electronics such as fuel cells, electrolyzers, batteries, sensors, and transistors; medical implants/devices for conduction of electrical signals; and biological systems for sensing or manipulation of protonic flows. Advantages include that the structural protein can withstand acidic conditions and heat (up to 80\u00b0C), genetic engineering methods can be applied to modify protein properties if required, the material is soft and flexible, enabling it to mold to desired shapes or contours, the protein is intrinsically biocompatible, and the proton conductivity value of the material is within range of those of man-made proton conductors.",

    "ip_description": "Inventors at UC Irvine have engineered an orthogonal DNA replication system capable of rapid, accelerated continuous evolution. This system enables the directed evolution of specific biomolecules towards user-defined functions and is applicable to problems of protein, enzyme, and metabolic pathway engineering. The dominant technology for directing the evolution of specific biomolecules involves rounds of in vitro PCR mutagenesis, cloning, transformation, and selection. This technique is disadvantageous because there are numerous steps and iterations, and the number of adaptive paths a biomolecule can take is limited. Further, this current approach cannot be scaled up to accommodate multiple, parallel experiments for comparative analysis. Researchers at UC Irvine have addressed these shortcomings by designing a replication system that is specific, continuous, and parallelizable. This invention enables researchers to evolve a gene or a collection of genes toward novel functions that require long mutational paths and large-scale replication of parallel, directed evolution experiments. This system is orthogonal, meaning that the error-prone DNA replication system does not increase the mutation rate of genomic DNA, it enables targeted mutagenesis of the genes of interest. Additionally, the method is entirely in vivo, which allows for continuous mutagenesis. Unlike other systems, this technique may be conducted in highly parallel format, owning to the small volumes required. Suggested uses include protein engineering for medical purposes such as therapeutic antibodies or agricultural uses such as proteins for improving crop yields, metabolic pathway engineering to evolve enzymes and metabolic pathways for superior production of commodity chemicals and biofuels, and drug development to utilize the platform to understand the emergence of target-based drug resistance and drug screen for alternative lead drug candidates. Advantages include in vivo manipulation of DNA replication inside a cell, versatility in defining selection for whole-cell or systems-level behaviors, targeted orthogonal system limiting non-specificity, parallelizable/high-throughput platform for massively parallel evolution experiments, and continuous/rapid direct evolution of genes that require long mutational paths with >100,000-fold higher than host genomic mutation rates.",

The surrounding package serves as the interface between the circuit electronic elements and the surrounding atmosphere and climate. Depending on the circuit needs, often the MEMS or IC elements will need to be hermetically sealed and protected to ensure proper circuit performance. Current manufacturing methods for proper electronic packaging are limited to size and form factor of MEMS or IC circuits.

Cell transfection, which is the delivery of genetic materials into living cells, is critical for many applications including gene therapy and cancer treatment. Various methods have been developed for the purpose of transfection, including viral vectors, where the virus is used as the carrier, non-viral vectors, and microinjection.

However, PDL therapy is limited because the degree of PWS blanching from the procedure can be unpredictable and variable.

    "ip_description": "The invention relates to a technique using a microfluidic device to perform co-encapsulation of samples in droplets and sorting of said droplets. This technique can achieve a one-one-one encapsulation efficiency of about 80% and can significantly improve the droplet sequencing and related applications in single cell genomics and proteomics. Droplet-based single cell assays are based on the ability to encapsulate and confine single cells in individual droplets and enable high-efficiency genome wide expression profiling. Encapsulation of a single cell and bead reagent is of critical importance when conducting droplet-based analysis of single cells. Currently, single cell encapsulation in droplets is randomly performed and not well controlled. One-cell-one-bead encapsulation efficiency is limited by an uncontrolled random droplet encapsulation of cells and beads (0.1% or 1 in 1000 droplets). Such a low droplet encapsulation efficiency hinders the realization of high throughput droplet-based experiments. Hence there is a need for improved microfluidic device for encapsulation in single droplets and sorting thereof. UCI researchers have developed a microfluidic droplet encapsulation method to efficiently encapsulate one-cell and one bead in a single droplet. By designing a microfluidic device with controllable fluid flow and a high force liquid-liquid interface, one-cell one-bead droplet encapsulation efficacy can be well controlled. The invention features a two-step technique to achieve high efficiency cell indexing coupled with down-stream sorting. In the first step, >30% cell encapsulation can be achieved by an interfacial shearing method utilizing laminar flows and high shear liquid-liquid interface at a microfluidic junction. A sorting module is incorporated as a second step to improve the encapsulation efficiency further, by up to 80% by removing empty droplets and/or droplets that do not contain the desired number of cells, beads or both. Utilizing the invented technology, it has been shown that a significant increase in droplet encapsulation efficiency can be readily achieved. While existing techniques only provide random encapsulation governed by Poisson statistics, the improved encapsulation efficiency in this invention enhances the ability to perform single cell genomics and proteomics on a microfluidic platform.",

In the push toward utilizing hydrogen gas (H2) as a clean energy alternative, the ability to rapidly detect minute quantities of leaked H2 has become increasingly important due to its high combustibility at concentrations >4% volume in air. According to the US Department of Energy, H2 sensors should have rapid response times, detecting 1% volume of H2 within one minute. Many commercial H2 sensors are chemiresistors, which display an increase in resistance upon adsorption of certain gases. Though sensor architecture has evolved over the years, palladium (Pd) has remained one of the most commonly studied sensor materials due to its high H2 sensitivity, simple preparation, and operability at room temperature. In particular, Pd nanowires (NWs) have demonstrated remarkable sensitivity to the presence of H2 due to their high surface area, which increases the number of H2 adsorption sites. Despite these advantages, Pd NWs have found limited application in actual hydrogen sensors due to their affinity for other air-based species, including oxygen and nitrogen, which dramatically limit the ability of the NWs to detect H2. To combat this lack of H2 selectivity, researchers at UCI have developed a protective filter layer that is easily added to Pd NWs. The filter layer is based on a common metal organic framework motif, whose pore sizes (0.34 nm) allow for the diffusion of H2 (0.289 nm) through the layer, while simultaneously blocking the larger oxygen (0.345 nm) and nitrogen (0.364 nm) molecules. Such functionalized Pd NWs display an improved response and recovery time, able to detect 1% H2 within 7s compared to the 164 s response time of bare Pd NWs.

It is a low cost portable system that integrates frequency domain and continuous wave domain for real time spectroscopic imaging of human tissue.\n\nBackground:\n\u00a7 Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic imaging (DOSI) is a non-invasive technique that utilize light in the near infrared spectral region (650-1000) nm to measure the optical properties of physiological tissue. It provides information about tissue function and structure through detection of four major components found in tissue: oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, water and lipids. Three main modalities currently exist for measuring optical properties: continuous wave (CW), frequency domain (FD) and time domain (TD) imaging.\n\u00a7 Continuous Wave (time \u2013unresolved) method provides qualitative information by measuring only relative changes in tissue components. This technique provides fast measurements and simple circuit designs.\n\u00a7 TD and FD methods provide quantitative approaches to optical imaging by separating absorption from scattering.\n\u00a7 Frequency domain imaging and time domain imaging both has limited spectral bandwidth. However, Frequency domain imaging overcomes limitations posed by other two modalities in terms of reducing system complexity, size and cost.\n\nProblem:\n\u00a7 Continuous Wave (time \u2013unresolved) methods are unable to separate scattering from absorption in single measurement. Also, these techniques assume constant scattering and neglect possible changes in scattering occurring during a continuous measurement. This assumption can introduce significant errors while accurately calculating absorber concentrations in the tissue.\n\u00a7 Time domain\u2019s optoelectronic high cost and complex circuitry reduces spectral bandwidth, due to which in applications like breast cancer, information about water and fat content are inaccessible.\n\nSolution:\n\u00a7 To overcome limitations posed by Continuous Wave (time \u2013unresolved) and time resolved techniques, a hybrid system has been developed that utilizes both modalities in tandem to extract near-infrared absorber concentrations accurately.\n\u00a7 The quantitative information is provided by the Frequency Domain Photon Migration module while large spectral bandwidth from 650 nm to 998 nm with step of 0.5 nm is provided by steady state module. Four tissue chromophores are extracted from broadband spectra.\n\nAdvantages:\n\u00a7 It is a hybrid system that uses both time-resolved and time unresolved imaging techniques for real-time spectroscopic imaging of human tissue.\n\u00a7 The system is low cost and portable.\n\u00a7 This system enables continuous scanning of surfaces which can replace discrete measurements on grid pattern used in earlier systems.\n\u00a7 This system outperforms the current system's data acquisition speed by 2 orders of magnitude while reducing the overall cost by $9000.\n\u00a7 The extremely fast data acquisition enables high resolution characterization of the pulsatile waveform.\n\u00a7 The CW module has a large dynamic range, enabling measurements in tissue with source detector spacing upto 4 cm.",

The setup, simply applied to the conventional inverted microscope, not only improves the imaging speed, resolution and field view, but also provides new capabilities for monitoring a much broader range of samples with various thicknesses and nature. These features combined open new frontiers for imaging applications, including tracking the development of cells in tissues, one of the ultimate goals for imaging.\n\nSelective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) proves to be a conventional and reliable candidate for fast three-dimensional imaging, with potential for high resolution imaging of cells and tissues. One of the key features for this technology is highly efficient image recording, significant depth penetration and reduced photo-bleaching. SPIM mainly utilizes two lenses; one for illumination and another for detection. Current SPIM arrangements require specific sample preparations, which unfortunately exclude the use of conventional sample mounts, such as coverslips, culture dishes and multi-well plates. In spite of the great potential that the SPIM technology can offer, currently followed approaches suffer from major drawbacks that need to be addressed. One popular approach is dipping the lens in the sample container so that they are both in the same fluid, while the other approach uses a light sheet generated by reflecting a beam incident from top using a small mirror. Dipping the lens in the sample container not only increases the container\u2019s size, but also eliminates the isolation between the optics and samples. Moreover, dipping from the top limits access from that direction. On the other hand, using the mirror imposes a need for precise positioning close to the sample, as well as risking mirror degradation because of the chemicals in the immersion fluid used. Such drawbacks impose major restrictions on the use of the SPIM technology, limiting the capabilities and potential that such technology has to offer.\nResearchers at UCI devised an innovative method for high-throughput 3D imaging that addresses the drawbacks of conventional techniques. Their method includes a novel illumination technique, as well as a modified sample chamber design. Such modifications maximize the field of view, eliminate the need for dipping the lens in the sample container and provide appropriate isolation. Moreover, such new arrangement facilitates the use of a wider range of samples varying in nature, thickness and sealing. The modified camber design enables multi-well monitoring, in an automated manner that would yield an unprecedented throughput imaging solution. The devised method unleashes the capabilities and opportunities offered by SPIM technology, which would improve the imaging process features and ability to track samples\u2019 development with time in an accurate and fast manner.",

    "ip_description": "This is a fabrication method for hydrogen gas sensors; these sensors have more rapid response times and are more sensitive than current detection techniques. The detection of leaked hydrogen gas (H2) in air has long been a challenge for sensing techniques. Due to its flammable nature at levels as low as 4% volume in air, as well as its colorless and odorless composition, reliable electronic methods for its rapid and sensitive detection are crucial. According to the US Department of Energy (DOE), H2 sensors should have a rapid response (detecting 1% volume of H2 within 1 minute) and a large dynamic range (able to detect between 0.1% - 4% volume H2). However, most H2 sensors are chemiresistors, which display an increase in resistance upon exposure to gas. Though the specific architecture of these devices has evolved over the years, the most sensitive is single-wall carbon nanotubes functionalized with metal nanoparticle defects (SWCNT-NPs). These platforms exhibit a dramatic response to H2, corresponding to a 1000-fold increase in resistance. SWCNT-NP sensors, though significantly more sensitive than other chemiresistors, suffer from slow response. Most are functionalized with palladium (Pd) nanoparticles, though the specific means of Pd NP deposition have not been studied, nor have the NPs been optimized in terms of size, stability, etc. Thus, there is a need to develop sensing devices which can rapidly detect H2 gas simultaneously over a large dynamic range of levels specified by the DOE. UCI researchers addressed these issues by fabricating sensors with a dynamic range and rapid response time meeting DOE standards with low power consumption at a comparable cost. This is done by using carbon nanotube ropes which are synthesized via dielectrophoresis, and then decorated with Pd nanoparticles via pulsed electrodeposition. Suggested uses: Sensors for H2 gas, especially at air levels ranging from 0.001 to 4% volume. Advantages: \u00b7 Wide dynamic range for H2 sensing (0.001% - 4% volume in air) \u00b7 Rapid response to all H2 exposure levels (62 sec) \u00b7 Rapid recovery time (72 sec, time for resistance to return to pre-hydrogen levels) \u00b7 Low power consumption (micro-Watt range) \u00b7 Requires only a small amount of precious materials (carbon, palladium) \u00b7 Flexible (carbon nanotubes are easily bent and stretched) \u00b7 Durable.",

The invention discloses a simple yet efficient technique for nanoinjection of material into a single cell with high transfection efficiency, controlled dosage delivery, and full cell viability.\n\nAdvancement of gene therapy application pushed the needs for novel and more efficient techniques to deliver DNA as well as macromolecules into cells.

    "ip_description": "A methodology to suppress additive and convolved noise in optical heterodyne signals. Often, the signal strength in optical spectroscopic techniques is weak and requires signal amplification. One such method of amplification mixes an oscillating optical signal with the weak signal. However, this amplification method is susceptible to noise artifacts caused by intensity fluctuations of the oscillating optical signal. Current optical intensity noise reduction solutions do not effectively address the noise artifacts by using expensive and often ill-suited matched detectors for reference. Researchers at the University of California have developed low cost method to improve the signal to noise ratio by dynamically subtracting such intensity fluctuations detected with a reference detector. The proposed invention suppresses additive and convolved noise in the optical heterodyne signals through reference beam detection and digital based subtraction. The intensity fluctuation of the oscillating optical signal is directly monitored prior to mixing with the weak signal to be digitally subtracted out of the combined detected signal. Noise suppression can be applied in real time to adjust for the changes in intensity of the optical oscillating signal improving signal noise down to the thermal noise floor of the detector. By increasing the signal to noise ratio of optical spectroscopic systems one can realize more information from weak signals detected. Suggested uses include suppressing the noise of amplified weak signals detected in non-linear and linear spectroscopic techniques, including but not limited to suppressing noise found in pump-probe non-linear Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy(CARS), and Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT).

    "ip_description": "A new approach to visualizing small and stenotic vasculature not readily visible with modern day diagnostic computed tomography angiography. Coronary computed tomography angiography is a commonly utilized imaging technique to visualize a patient\u2019s vasculature and potential vascular narrowing. Unfortunately, computed tomography angiography is unable to resolve small vessel cross-sectional area with a diagnostic accuracy of 50%. To overcome such shortcomings, vessel identification can be improved by a semi-automatic thresholding methodology. However, this method is highly dependent on the vessel size such that stenosis severity would be underestimated or overestimated based on the threshold selected. To address vessel measurements affected by arterial calcification, a pre-contrast image can be subtracted from a post contrast CT image to remove the unwanted artifact. Yet again, this method is not perfect and is limited by patient motion artifacts in between CT scans that yield inaccurate background subtraction. Clearly, an accurate and robust method that can measure vessel cross-section area (CSA) and stenosis severity in coronary CT angiography would be desirable. UCI researchers have created a simple signal processing methodology that calculates the CSA of vessels. The method circumvents the problems associated by low resolution computed tomography systems at the voxel level by analyzing the conserved total signal in each area of interest. The proposed method improves the precision and accuracy of identifying small and narrowed vasculature by a factor of two and three, respectively. Suggested uses: Identify small or stenotic blood vessels that wouldn\u2019t be resolvable due to the current resolution limit in modern day computed diagnostic computed tomography.

During the heart valve deployment procedure, physicians are only able to utilize x-ray computed tomography to obtain real-time imaging feedback while precisely deploying the transcatheter heart valve. Unfortunately, x-ray computed tomography utilizes high doses of harmful ionizing radiation, and provides limited information in the form of a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional anatomy.

Researchers at UCI have developed a new method to reliably mass produce universal superhydrophobic surfaces in a simpler and more cost effective manner. Superhydrophobic surfaces are surfaces which, due to their inability to interact with liquids, are highly resistant to wetting. This liquid aversion leads to a host of interesting properties, perhaps most notably making the surfaces self-cleaning and antibacterial. Self-cleaning behaviors, which help to prevent the spread of diseases, have landed superhydrophobic surfaces an important role in health applications, while the antibacterial nature makes them suitable for inclusion in biomedical devices. Several everyday objects, such as boats, solar cells, and windshield wipers also benefit from the low liquid adhesion of superhydrophobic materials. There are currently two main methods for producing superhydrophobic surfaces. The first relies on covering a surface with a superhydrophobic chemical coating. This method is highly selective as the chemical coating will only bind to certain surfaces. Additionally, the coating can wear off, destroying the superhydrophobicity of the surface and exposing the surrounding environment to possibly harmful chemicals. The second method, rather than relying on chemical modification, instead modifies suitable surfaces structurally to impart superhydrophobic behavior. These methods include processes such as directed etching and nanoparticle self-assembly, and are complex, time-consuming, and therefore ultimately difficult to use for large-scale production. To solve these safety concerns and production limitations, researchers at UCI have developed a simple method for large-scale fabrication of structurally superhydrophobic surfaces. The process consists of depositing metals onto an industrial-sized sheet of shrink film as it is continuously rolled from one holder to another; this method is called roll-to-roll manufacturing. Once heated, the shrink film contracts, causing the metal coatings to generate structural features that are superhydrophobic. These structured films, cut to any desired size and shape, are then used to imprint an inherently hydrophobic material (such as silicone or plastic), resulting in a superhydrophobic plastic surface. As the superhydrophobicity is purely structural in nature, the resulting films do not suffer from the degradation seen in chemical coatings. Additionally, their direct deposition onto large rolls of film makes this technique relatively simple and highly compatible with mass production.",

This spring-actuated brace provides the necessary hand-forearm support and counterbalances wrist stiffness/resistance to stretch typical to stroke patients. This device significantly reduces the effort required for a hand movement in patients with varying degrees of motion impairment. Physical impairments, such as excessive wrist stiffness and resistance to stretch (or \u201ctone\u201d), are typical consequences of a stroke. These changes may cause significant pain and are known to increase the torque demand on wrist muscles, affecting the overall hand movement. Therefore, a wrist support system that can mitigate the additional muscle stress experienced by stroke survivors and ease the hand movement is needed in order to reduce the possibility of negative effects during rehabilitation therapy and improve therapy outcome. UCI researchers have now developed the first supportive active wrist brace that dynamically cancels out the torque demand on the wrist joint of the stroke survivor, thereby decreasing the muscle force required to achieve hand motion.

Critical for the diagnostic of some diseases like melanoma. Diagnostic accuracy may be significantly improved through measurement of functional information in addition to conventional structural analysis of lesions. Blood flow is a critical aspect of functional information about skin lesions.\n\nProblem: \n\nDermatoscopy only might not be sufficient enough for accurate diagnostic of lesions. Blood flow measurement may significantly aid in accurate diagnostics. Commercially available solutions to provide maps of blood flow are both bulky and expensive. Such devices are impractical for routine use in clinics. Other solutions involve invasive measurements, which can be more complicated.\n\nSolution: \n\nThe invention combines dermatoscopy and blood flow measurement in one single device. It integrates a compact Laser Speckle Imaging (LSI) system into a dermatoscope. LSI is a non-invasive solution for dynamic imaging of blood flow. It focuses on interpreting the speckle pattern phenomenon that occurs when electromagnetic light waves interfere with one another to produce optically visible effects. Analysis of these speckle patterns results in quantitative wide-field imaging data pertaining to blood flow velocity mapping. Two illumination sources are used (one for the LSI system, and a white LED for the visual inspection). Both blood flow imaging and visual inspection are performed simultaneously. In spite of it\u2019s handheld nature, it\u2019s real time blood flow measuring capabilities are equivalent to those of a laboratory-grade device. The technology can aid in significantly improving diagnostic accuracy.\n\nSuggested uses\n\n- Blood flow measurement \n- Skin Dermatoscopy \n- Cancer screening\n\nAdvantages\n\n\u00a7 Adds additional and valuable functionality to a commonly used device (dermatoscope) \n\u00a7 Simultaneous blood flow imaging and visual inspection \n\u00a7 Provides a portable, accurate solution for blood flow measurement \n\u00a7 Small in size and easy to operate \n\u00a7 Less expensive than commercially available technologies used to measure blood flow \n\u00a7 Has equivalent capabilities to the bulky expensive devices.",

    "ip_description": "Traditional anti-cancer treatments used for metastatic melanoma (skin cancer) can result in cell toxicity, poor efficacy, and low patient survival. UCI researchers have uncovered a class of potent compounds that inhibit cancer cell growth and induce cancer cell death by targeting RhoJ signaling pathways. Melanoma develops from cancer cells in the skin. In nearly all pre-metastatic cases surgical removal of the cancer cells is curative; however, after metastasis traditional cancer treatments can result in cell toxicity, poor efficacy, and low patient survival. Previous studies have implicated the RhoJ signaling pathway in modulating melanoma cell migration, accelerates tumor growth, and inhibits cell death activity. Hence, targeting the RhoJ pathway represents a promising approach to developing anti-cancer drugs. UCI researchers have discovered a class of small molecules to block RhoJ signaling for treating stage III melanomas or stage IV melanomas resistant to other treatments. They identified potent inhibitors of human RhoJ and other related proteins downstream in the pathway that activate cell death in melanoma cells, while blocking cancer cell proliferation. These therapeutics may be employed as a single or combinatory treatment with other anticancer drugs (e.g., cisplatin). The molecules are permeable to cell membranes in complex biological environments and their scaffold have inherent drug-likeness, which would enable great chemical diversity in anti-cancer drug development. The new compounds provide a promising approach for treating melanoma and other cancers by essentially releasing the downstream block on cell death in cancer cells. Suggested uses: \u2022 Treatment of melanoma and disorders associated with increased levels of RhoJ (e.g. hyperplasia, metaplasia or dysplasia, cancer metastasis, hyperproliferative disorders \u2022 Treatment of retinal disorders and cardiomyopathies \u2022 Can be used ether as a stand-alone therapeutic or combinatory chemotherapeutic (e.g. with cisplatin or radiation therapy)",

Clearly, providing an accurate atherosclerotic plaque identification and treatment option will contribute significantly to treating cardiovascular diseases, which happens to be a leading cause of death in many countries.\n\nCardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death in many countries, with atherosclerotic plaques being the main cause of these diseases. Accurate assessment of the plaque, including its type, is critical for determining the best treatment option for the patient. For that purpose, optical coherence tomography (OCT) with a 1.3 mm laser source is by far the most frequently utilized instrument. Although the 1.3 mm laser OCT identifies some of the key characteristics of plaque, unfortunately, this imaging device is limited by the penetration depth achieved. To overcome this drawback, ultrasound- in spite of its relatively lower resolution- is used together with the OCT to obtain better plaque detection and identification. Researchers at the University of California, Irvine, have created an innovative integrated imaging system that integrates a new laser source, which offers better penetration depth and sharper images, with imaging solutions like ultrasound, near infrared and photo acoustic imaging techniques. The new OCT can improve the identification and detection plaque.

    "ip_description": "Medical devices are susceptible to contamination by harmful microbes, such as bacteria and fungi, which form biofilms on device surfaces. These biofilms are often resistant to antibiotics and other current treatments, resulting in over 2 million people per year suffering from diseases related to these contaminating microbes. Death rates for many of these diseases are high, often exceeding 50%. Researchers at UCI have developed a novel anti-bacterial and anti-fungal biocomposite that incorporates a nanopillared surface structure that can be applied as a coating to medical devices. Microbes that are perilous to human health (i.e. bacteria, fungi) frequently infect commonly used, invasive medical devices. Once they infect these medical device surfaces, microbes form biofilms, which are hard to penetrate and account for 80% of all infections due to contamination of medical devices and surfaces. Treatments for diseases by some of these bacteria or fungi are either non-existent or ineffective. Current solutions to prevent infection involve chemical treatment and antibiotics for medical device surfaces. However, the potency of chemical treatments usually diminishes over time, and microbes often develop antibiotic resistance, rendering antibiotics ineffective. To prevent infection of medical devices by harmful microbes, researchers at UCI have developed a novel biocomposite composed of certain materials. They key feature is the incorporation of structures called nanopillars, which have been proven to have anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. The materials comprising this biocomposite possess the flexibility and mechanical strength required by many invasive medical devices. Thus, the biocomposite can be applied as a film or coating to medical devices that renders the devices anti-bacterial and anti-fungal.

The algorithm used in ParBreZo v.8.0 is highly stable, i.e. any errors introduced into the calculations for flood inundation are not amplified. By using an innovative computational algorithm, and accelerating runs on parallel computing architecture, it exhibits a high level of accuracy relative to the low computational cost. ParBreZo v.8.0 is one of few software than can simulate flood dynamics due to unusual reasons, going beyond rainfall and coastal tides, e.g. dam-breaks. Unprecedented fine-tuning of multiple input parameters insures more accurate results. ParBreZo accurately meshes and represents different terrains and geographical regions. For these reasons, ParBreZo is superior to other software for flood inundation modeling and predictions. Suggested uses include predicting and evaluating baseline flood risk conditions, informing and prioritizing investment decisions, assessing historical, current and future risks for flood insurance, assessing risks to global manufacturing facilities, and assessing impacts of flooding to distributed networks such as transportation, communication and power systems.

    "ip_description": "Additive layer manufacturing systems, also known as 3D printers, are a powerful tool for manufacturers in both rapid prototyping stage and full-scale production. Sensitive intellectual property is carried in the electronic information of the design files utilized by 3D printers. However, the physical characteristics of the machine in operation, including power, temperature, sounds, and motion can also reveal sensitive information that could be used to reverse-engineer a product. The inventors at UCI have demonstrated the threat posed by such side-channel attacks, and have developed countermeasures that obscure information which would otherwise be exposed during printer operation. Additive layer manufacturing systems, or 3D printers, have become a promising technology for providing cost, time, and space effective solutions by reducing the gap between designers and manufacturers. However, security concerns for the protection of intellectual property have risen along with the widespread use of 3D printers. Relevant intellectual property is carried in the geometric design, material properties, process, and physical machine. The inventors at UCI have shown that intellectual property information from the cyber domain (3D models, design files, etc.) can be recovered or reconstructed through non-intrusive attacks during the manufacturing process by recording a range of parameters such as power consumption, temperature profiles, acoustic information, nozzle motion, and electromagnetic emission. The inventors at UCI have developed measures to prevent side channels from the physical domain to steal intellectual property in the cyber domain. The first measure involves machine-dependent physical process encryption. This measure injects unnecessary information into the control code in order to obfuscate the printing process from simple prediction models used by attackers. The unnecessary information can come in the form of random delays or extra movements of the motors, as well as external noise generators. The second measure is a security-aware, machine-independent 3D printing algorithm to generate a code which controls the printer. Most 3D printing algorithms are simple, being focused on optimizing for speed, material consumption, or power. As such, attackers are easily able to recreate model files from physical information. In order to prevent easy reconstruction, the proposed algorithm will generate control code differently for the same 3D object. Identical products will be made with different printer movements, masking the overall shape to the attackers.",

Currently, cells are pipetted from their current dish of media to a new dish of media, in a process that is stressful to the cells and could cause damage.

    "ip_description": "A low-cost method of manufacturing a, rough high surface area electrodes with a dissolvable polymer coating to improve surface wettability and electrochemical sensing. An electrochemical sensor\u2019s performance is highly dependent on the electrode electrochemical active surface area (EASA) that interfaces with the sample. Maintaining a large surface area when miniaturizing electrochemical sensors poses a manufacturing challenging. Established methodologies of increasing EASA for miniature sensors include complex chemical deposition methodologies that require expensive equipment and clean-room facilities. More recently, research has shown that enhanced EASE can be realized by heat-shrinking a polymer substrate coated with metal thin film electrodes. The heat-shrinking process is low-cost and does not require sophisticated equipment or clean rooms. However simple the heat shrink process is, there are constraints such as \u201csecondary wrinkling\u201d and poor wettability that inhibit the electrodes from achieving their theoretical maximum EASE. Poor wettability would lead to non-ideal EASE signal strength due to air bubbles that become trapped in the wrinkled structure inhibiting the contact of the sample chemical with the entire surface area of the electrode. The presented invention modifies the surface of the electrodes by adding a layer of dissolvable polymer coating that prevents air pockets from forming when the sample chemical comes into contact with the sensor. Over time the water soluble polymer will degrade and the sample solution will come into contact with functionalized aptamers residing on the gold electrodes. Suggested uses include point of care diagnostics for protein biomarkers as a measure of cancer therapy efficacy, glucose biosensors, and detecting infectious pathogens. Advantages include the low-cost and ease of manufacturing, which would allow the sensors to be readily used in developing regions of the world as a point of care diagnostic. Another advantage is the increased electrode electrochemical active surface area, which increases the signal to noise ratio.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCI have developed a device that harvests enough energy from the human body to continuously power cells phones and other on-body devices. Converting the natural energy of the human body into usable power has long been a challenge for the biomedical field. This body power, if harvested at sufficient levels (>1 W), can be used to internally power biomedical devices that would otherwise require removal and off-site charging. Typical methods for converting body energy into power rely on thermoelectric effects, which generate power based on the temperature difference between a body and its environment. The efficiency of these devices is limited by the maximum temperature difference, which is generally less than 20\u00b0C, confining the output power to the mW range. To combat the low efficiency of thermoelectric devices, researchers at UCI have instead proposed a device that utilizes the belly motion associated with breathing. As this motion is continuous over a 24-hour period, it provides a constant, sustainable source of energy. In addition to being continuous, belly motion also generates fairly large powers \u2013 a typical breath that corresponds to ~1 cm motion generates ~2 W of power. Finally, this device (which can be integrated into a belt) directly converts the kinetic energy of motion into electricity and so is not limited by the same efficiency constraints as thermoelectric devices.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Multi-antenna communication schemes provide greater link quality and reliability than single antenna systems, but also require coordination between the antennas for maximum effect. The traditional method of training (aligning) the antennas before data transmission becomes infeasible for arrays with many transmitters. The inventors at UCI have made many antennas accessible by interleaving the training and feedback stages.\n\nThe performance of a wireless communication system can be greatly improved by making the channel state information (CSI) available at the transmitter and the receiver. This information describes how a signal propagates from the transmitter to the receiver and represents the combined effect of, for example, scattering, fading, and power decay with distance. The CSI makes it possible to adapt transmissions to current channel conditions, which is crucial for achieving reliable communication with high data rates in multi-antenna systems. In a massive multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, having CSI at the transmitter (CSIT) is especially desirable as one can then fully exploit the performance gains promised by the large number of transmitter antennas via CSI-adaptive transmission strategies such as beamforming. A typical way to acquire CSIT is channel training followed by (digital) feedback.\nTraining and feedback are traditionally viewed as two non-interleaving processes. According to this traditional viewpoint, for each channel state, the transmitter first trains all of its antennas at once, so that the receiver acquires the entire CSI. The conventional scheme appears to be infeasible in the case of a massive MISO system. Even the training phase, by itself, would be very challenging to realize due to the large number of transmitter antennas that need to be trained. Conventional limited feedback schemes do not provide much hope in this context. The feedback rates required for even the simplest of the limited feedback schemes such as antenna selection grow without bound as the number of transmitter antennas grow to infinity.\nThe inventors at UCI have developed a method to interleave the training and feedback stages in a multiple-antenna communication system. The transmitter trains its antennas one by one and receives feedback information immediately after training each one of its antennas. The feedback message may ask the transmitter to train another antenna; or, it may terminate the feedback/training phase and provide the quantized codeword (e.g., a beamforming vector) to be utilized for data transmission. If the already-trained antennas provide sufficiently favorable conditions for data transmission, one can then terminate the training phase and thus avoid wasting more resources on training the rest of the antennas. The method makes possible the design of multi-antenna communication systems, whose feedback and training overheads remain completely independent of the number of transmitter antennas, and which, at the same time, can achieve the same performance as a system with perfect transmitter and receiver CSI.\n\nAdvantages\n\n\u00a7 Antenna training and feedback overheads remain completely independent of the number of transmitter antennas\n\u00a7 Achieves the same performance as a system, with perfect transmitter and receiver CSI\n\u00a7 Method can be extended to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems or to multiuser scenarios with different performance measures",

The American Society of Interventional Pain Physician\u2019s opioid guideline recommends repeated pill counting by physicians to reduce misuse and drug diversion by ensuring patients adhere to the dosing and timing protocol.

    "ip_description": "The invention is a specialized membrane that absorbs solar energy to directly drive desalination of salt water. Compared to state of the art devices, the invention is capable of bypassing the inefficient conversion from electronic energy to ionic energy, saving up to 85% of the energy required by other state of the art electrodialysis cells. Potable water is a universal human need. Desalination is an important tool for creating potable water from salt water sources, either in regions that lack sufficient freshwater sources or for disaster relief. Current desalination technologies are expensive and inefficient, even on large scale. State of the art solar-driven electrodialysis cells use 5 times the minimum energy required by thermodynamics. Traditionally, a solar cell is separately used to generate electricity which is in turn used to power an electrodialysis cell. This involves inefficiencies in both the electricity generation and powering of the cell. The inventors at UCI have developed an integrated solar electrodialysis device which is driven directly by sunlight. The device uses a photoacid-dye-functionalized membrane to drive ions through separate filters, leaving behind salt-free water. The process much more efficient than separate solar and electrodialysis cells, using up to 85% less energy.",

    "ip_description": "The present invention relates to portable Spirometry system that uses sound to transmit pulmonary airflow information to a receiver. Home monitoring of lung function is becoming increasingly important in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which affects over 400 million people. Spirometers measure the speed (airflow) and lung volume of air in and out of the lungs. Thus, spirometers are used by healthcare providers to diagnose chronic lung conditions and to determine drug efficacy. Importantly, patients also use spirometers to monitor whether a treatment for their chronic lung condition is improving their breathing. Existing portable spirometers that measure airflow must use sensors and electronics, making them cost prohibitive for some patients and inconvenience due to their bulky size (roughly the size of a laptop). Existing smaller portable (wireless) spirometers only measure air volume (not airflow), which is generally considered to be a poor indicator of lung function. The present invention provides a small portable spirometer device that measures airflow, and transmits the information wirelessly to a second device (i.e., receiver). The present invention can be used to monitor a chronic lung condition and treatment efficacy at home by a patient, or by a healthcare provider. It can also be used by patients or healthcare providers to find the cause of chronic lung conditions and assess the effects of contaminants on lung functions, generally. The present invention is comparably cheaper and more convenient (due to small portable size) than alternative spirometry devices that measure airflow. Additionally, unlike existing small portable spirometers that measure lung volume, the present invention measures airflow, which is generally considered to be a better indicator of lung function. Device is currently in development.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Many modern microelectromechanical and microembossing applications require the formation of high resolution vertical channels through thin film substrates, which are often difficult and expensive to achieve in current substrates. Researchers at UCI have overcome these limitations by developing an inexpensive material that is inherently easy to vertically etch.\n\nModern microscale technologies, such as microelectronics and micropatterning, require the generation of high resolution, deep vertical channels that extend through substrate layers. For example, 3D integrated circuits, which contain vertically-stacked electronic components, require conducting vertical channels to facilitate inter-component communication. Microembossing techniques, where designs are patterned onto a substrate surface, also require controllable vertical etching. The most common substrate materials for these applications are silicon and glass. Silicon, though readily available, is expensive and requires extensive processing in order to achieve adequate film thinness and smoothness. The next most widely used material, glass, is less costly and more easily implemented than silicon. Its brittle and fragile nature, however, limit the density of channels that can be established.\n\nCurrently, channel formation in these materials is achieved by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE), which is an expensive and involved process that often requires several iterations to achieve sufficient channel depth. Additionally, the best aspect ratios (channel depth vs width) that can be obtained under DRIE is ~30:1. To overcome these production and geometric limitations, researchers at UCI have instead proposed using a substrate with specific properties. This material is specially patterned using a proprietary process. The proposed method requires only a single step to generate channels as deep as 100 microns, with aspect ratios that can reach 100:1.\n\nAdvantages\n\n\u00a7 method for generating a large density of deep (100 micron), high resolution vertical channels in a an inherently insulating thin film substrate\n\n\u00a7 Substrate requires less pre-processing than silicon, and is more robust than glass\n\n\u00a7 Channels bored in a single step\n\n\u00a7 Channels have aspect ratio >3x greater than those generated in standard materials",

    "ip_description": "The present invention describes a component package that enables a microfluidic device to be fixed to a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) or other substrate, and embedded within a larger microfluidic system. Microfluidic systems are used for applications where small quantities of fluid need to be manipulated and controlled. A microfluidic component consists of a small device that is intended to be embedded within a microfluidic system. It typically contains one or more ports that allow the components to come into contact with fluid routed on a microfluidic layer, and perform a function that is useful to the operation of the microfluidic system. Microfluidic components may perform operations such as micro-pumps, micro-valves, micro-heaters, micro-electrodes, micro-sensors, etc. A microfluidic component package (MFCP) allows a device to be readily integrated within a microfluidic system. Conventional microfluidic production approaches involve the production of capillary systems in polymer, glass or other materials using embossing or etch methods. These methods are efficient at producing microfluidic channels, but they are poor for integrating electronics, optics, and mechanical functions into the system. Usually, these non-fluidic parts are added as external components after the microfluidics have been produced. In some cases, attempts are made to include these functions during the manufacturing process of the microfluidic channels. However, this results in a highly complex and expensive manufacturing process that is not suitable for large scale production. To embed the components within the larger microfluidic system, the components need to be connected with one or more microfluidic channels, and potentially electrical, optical, mechanical, or thermal connections. Currently, there is no way to do this in a consistent manner that is compatible with large-scale manufacturing. The present invention discloses a Microfluidic Component Package (MFCP) that can produce a consistent interface between a small microfluidic device and a larger microfluidic system, while also allowing access to electrical, optical, mechanical, and thermal connections.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCI have developed a nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM) instrument for the rapid and non-destructive imaging of wide areas and large volumes of biological tissue. Imaging can be performed either ex vivo or in vivo, and with sub-micron resolution at higher scanning speeds than previously possible.\n\nOptical microscopy and micro-spectroscopy of biological samples, for biological and biophysical research\n\nNon-invasive imaging of the skin, for medical and cosmetic industries\n\nIncreased field-of-view: The proposed invention allows for >5 times larger fields-of-vision than standard methods.\n\nFaster: Imagining scans are obtained ~15 times faster than standard methods.\n\nHigh resolution: Despite the increased FOV and scanning speed, the microscope still allows for >\u03bcm resolution.\n\nNon-destructive: Imaging is non-destructive and non-invasive and can be performed both in and ex vivo.\n\nNonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM), or multi-photon microscopy (MPM), is an imaging technique which utilizes nonlinear interactions between light and matter to characterize the material of interest. It is often preferred over standard optical microscopy as it allows for more straightforward 3D imaging, affords higher signal-to-noise ratios (better imaging contrast), is entirely label-free, and is less likely to induce damage in biological samples.\n\nTwo of the most common methods of NLOM for tissue imaging are two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and second harmonic generation (SHG). Here, a focused laser beam is raster scanned across the sample to create high resolution images; imaging contrast arises directly and naturally from SHG of collagen and TFEP of other tissue components, such as elastin, keratin, and melanin. As such, NLOM techniques may have important applications in clinical settings, including label-free, in vivo cancer detection and the characterization of skin damage and aging effects. For NLOM to be truly useful in clinical settings, however, it must be able to quickly provide high-resolution images of large tissue areas (on the order of tens of mm2). Typically, the field of vision (FOV) of a NLOM setup is limited to about 0.5 x 0.5 mm2 and additionally has a relatively long pixel dwell time (~20 \u03bcs per pixel). In these setups, several small area scans would have to be collected and stitched together, a process which is highly time consuming and altogether unfeasible for clinical use.\n\nTo make NLOM techniques more amenable to clinical applications, researchers at UCI have developed a novel microscope setup, which, in addition to retaining the requisite sub-micron resolution, is capable of rapid (<1 \u03bcs/pixel dwell time) imaging of large tissue areas (800 x 800 mm2). The system consists of a resonant scanning mirror, pulsed imaging laser, relay lens system, galvo mirror, beam expander, and microscope objective, all of which are optically coupled in series. The resonant scanning mirrors, which operate at \u22654 kHz rate, steer the beam in the x-direction quickly while the galvo mirror displaces it along the y-axis. The relay lens system and beam expander compensate for optical any aberrations (imaging artifacts), and the objective has a high numerical aperture such that it achieves sub-micron resolution. Here, large area images can be obtained in ~0.1 s, making the system highly compatible with clinical applications.",

The present method is accomplished by a highly integrated design that optimally packs, thermocycles, and images as many as 1 million reaction vessels.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a common and often indispensable technique for nucleic acid detection in medical and biological research labs for a variety of applications. This technique generates millions of copies of a target DNA sequence that can be purified and quantified after the reaction is completed. The amplification of a genetic sequence provides valuable information about biochemical processes in a single cell to the entire body. Several improvements of this technique include real-time or quantitative PCR (RT- or qPCR) and digital PCR (dPCR) that overcome difficulties associated with conventional PCR processes. qPCR allows for simultaneous, or real-time, amplification and quantification of DNA samples. In dPCR samples are partitioned into multiple individual, parallel amplification cycles allowing for high levels of amplification and end-point quantification of complex samples. While these methods save time, reduce effort, increase accuracy, and conserve valuable sample, they still suffer from a low dynamic range (i.e., between 5-7 orders of magnitude). Researchers at UC Irvine developed device and method that combines real-time imaging of qPCR and high-throughput processing of dPCR, thereby dramatically increasing the upper end of the dynamic range by 100 orders of magnitude, and enabling both real-time and end-point quantification.

    "ip_description": "No vaccines exist against the common sexually-transmitted disease, Chlamydia. The current invention is a novel vaccination formulation wherein fragments from two different microbial proteins, one each from a Chlamydia species and a Neisseria species are fused together. This novel fusion protein is proposed as a robust vaccine to provide protection against Chlamydia. In the US alone, over 1 million cases of Chlamydia are reported each year. Increasing prevalence of Multiple-Drug Resistant Chlamydia is rendering antibiotic treatment increasingly ineffective. Furthermore, there is no effective vaccine on the market. Current experimental vaccines against Chlamydia use a complete protein from the pathogen as the vaccine. The properties of this protein include low solubility, low stability, and the need for detergent solubilization during purification \u2013 consequently resulting in a relatively ineffective vaccine. The current invention circumvents these problems by using a mix-and-match approach of combining proteins - a specific sub-region from this same Chlamydia protein and the entire protein from a different Neisseria species. This fusion protein has the potential to be a very effective vaccine against Chlamydia. By design, only a fragment of the Chlamydia protein is included in the protein fusion so that expression and purification steps are easier, and less expensive than for the whole protein. Careful choice of the Chlamydia protein fragment, and fusion to the Neisseria protein, vastly increase likelihood of a robust immune response and an effective vaccine.",

Scientists at UCI have developed antibodies to the receptor for C1q, C1qRp, to be used as a target for prophylactic treatments in populations at high risk of infection.\n\nThe classical complement pathway is generally seen as a crucial contributor to the immune system. The first component of this pathway, C1q, is responsible for enhancing the ability for cells to clear pathogens from an organism. In particular, C1q has been known to mediate enhancement of phagocytosis. In order to target this system, the method by which C1q enhances phagocytosis should be investigated.\n\nResearchers at UCI have developed antibodies that target C1qRp, the receptor for C1q. These antibodies have been shown to inhibit C1q-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis, which provides strong evidence that C1qRp is heavily involved in this process. Utilization of these antibodies will allow further isolation and characterization of C1qRp, which could present the ability to regulate the phagocytic capacity of cells. Thus, C1qRp is a viable target for prophylactic treatments in populations at high risk of infection, including individuals with genetic immunodeficiency, patients with HIV or cancer, or patients undergoing chemotherapy or high risk surgeries.\n\nAdvantages\n\nAllows the ability to enhance a naturally occurring feature of the immune system; may have few side effects or introduce fewer foreign substances to the body than other preventative treatments\n\nState Of Development\n\nAntibodies (R139, R3, U40.3) have been developed and shown in vitro to allow the isolation and characterization of C1qRp",

    "ip_description": "The present invention discloses a small device to measure Intraocular Pressure. This invention communicating the measurements of Intraocular pressure with outside devices. Background: Pressure in various organs of the body (e.g., brain, eye, heart) is highly regulated and its value can provide an indication of patient health or disease progression. In diseases where the ability to regulate these pressures is lost, impairment of function or death may result; even at the microscopic level, cell damage may be induced in the presence of abnormal pressure. Monitoring the absolute value of and variation of internal pressures allows diagnosis and tracking of the progress of medical intervention. Measuring Intraocular Pressure (IOP) directly in the human eye is very difficult, and the currently available IOP monitoring methods use external measurement techniques to infer the IOP of the eye. Problem: Currently available Intraocular Pressure (IOP) monitoring methods use external measurement techniques to infer the IOP of the eye, this technique becomes cumbersome.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCI have recently developed a non-invasive tissue diagnostic procedure that is simpler and more easily implemented than standard methods. Elastography, which allows for the elastic properties of soft tissue to be imaged and characterized, is an important tool in tissue diagnostics. These measurements work by inducing a vibration in the tissue, leading to the propagation of a shear wave. The shear wave, which carries information about tissue density and composition, is then detected. For most applications, the tissue vibrations are generated by acoustic radiation force (ARF) from sound waves and detected through optical coherence elastography (OCE), which uses near-infrared light to image and characterize the tissue. So-called ARF-OCE measurements that marry these two techniques are preferred due to their high imaging resolution, quick speed, and ability to penetrate into and collect information from sub-surface tissue. Typically, measurements are set up such that the excited shear wave propagates along the direction parallel to the optical detecting beam. These ARF-OCE methods suffer from two main drawbacks, both arising from the shear wave propagation direction. First, as the shear waves attenuate rapidly within tissue, there is a very limited range from which they can be detected in the direction parallel to the optical beam. This makes ARF-OCE difficult to implement for live imaging of small and thin tissues, such as the cornea. Secondly, this requires significant post-processing by Doppler OCT methods, in part to correct for the bulk motion of the tissue during the measurement. Recently, researcher at UCI have developed a modification to the standard ARF-OCE technique that instead generates shear wave propagation in the direction perpendicular to the detecting beam. This makes the overall geometry more convenient to implement in cornea imaging and characterization. It also is less sensitive to bulk motion of the tissue, and therefore can utilize the much simpler Doppler-variance-based data processing techniques. Advantages include: Shear wave propagates in the direction parallel to the detection beam, technique is more compatible with imaging and characterizing optical tissue than conventional (parallel shear wave) methods, and requires less post-processing & is less sensitive to bulk sample motion. Researchers have successfully used this technique to measure shear wave propagation in a bilayer tissue 'phantom' (replica tissue) as a proof-of-concept. The next step, which researchers posit will be completed within the next year, is to use this method to detect shear waves in actual ocular tissue.",

    "ip_description": "The invention consists of a multi-channel, droplet-generating microfluidic device with a strategically placed feature. The feature vibrates in order to counteract particle-trapping micro-vortices formed within the device. Counteracting these vortices allows for single particle encapsulation in the droplets formed by the device and thereby makes this technology a good candidate for use in single cell diagnostics and drug delivery systems. Devices that rely on the movement and manipulation of small quantities of fluids are known as microfluidic devices. These devices contain micro-channels that allow fluids flow through. Often, these devices also contain focusing regions for the manipulation of those fluids. A subclass of microfluidic devices, which are configured to produce droplets of fluids, has the potential to be valuable to the advancement of targeted drug delivery systems and single cell diagnostics. Specifically, this subclass has the ability to encapsulate particles, such as single cells or therapeutic agents, in the generated fluid droplets. One drawback to using droplet generating microfluidic devices to encapsulate particles is that the particles of interest may become trapped in micro-vortices. These micro-vortices form in the flow-focusing regions of the device, preventing the particles from becoming encapsulated. Additionally, due to Poisson\u2019s stochastic distribution, when particle encapsulations occur, they may occur as multi-particle encapsulations in a single droplet. This results in heterogeneity in the final product. Researchers at UCI have invented a droplet generating microfluidic device that uses a strategically placed feature to create counter-vortices in the flow-focusing region of the device. The characteristics of the feature are tunable and easily controlled. Counteracting the micro-vortices results in fewer trapped particles and a higher number of particle encapsulations. The parameters of the feature can also be tuned to enhance the number of single particle encapsulations over existing methods (such as magnetic bead or cytometry-based approaches). These advantages make the technology a prime candidate for single cell diagnostics and applications where a homogeneous final product is vital (such as in drug delivery systems).",

    "ip_description": "The invention is in the field of MEMS gyroscopes capable of simultaneous measurement of angular position and angular rate. A sensor is fabricated with micron feature sizes capable of simultaneously measuring absolute angles of rotation and angular rotational rates. The measurements are made directly from the position and velocity of the device without the need for electronic integration or differentiation. The device measures angle directly, avoiding the integration of electronic errors and allowing for higher performance in attitude measurement.

Through the fabrication of the device using lithographic methods, the device can be made small and in large qualities, resulting in low costs and low power consumption. All micromachined gyroscopes are vibratory in nature, measuring either angular rates by detecting energy coupled between orthogonal vibration modes due to Coriolis force or angle of rotation through the precession of an oscillation pattern. In a rate gyroscope, a structural element is forced into oscillation in one principle structural mode, designated the \u201cdrive\u201d mode. The presence of rotation induced Coriolis force couples the sustained oscillation into an orthogonal structural mode, designated the \u201csense\u201d mode. The magnitude of vibration induced in the sense mode is proportional to the rotation rate of the device. However, these devices require integration of the electronic output signal to obtain orientation, magnifying drift and noise errors causing reduced performance. Prior work in the state of the art has produced a micromachined angle measuring gyroscope. However, the prior art control electronics of the gyroscope does not allow for the simultaneous detection of angular position and angular velocity. At present, no micromachined angle measuring devices exist on the market since designers are focused exclusively on the design of micromachined rate measuring gyroscopes. These devices require integration of the electronic output signal to obtain position, magnifying drift and noise errors which results in reduced performance. In the illustrated embodiment a sensor is fabricated with micron feature sizes capable of simultaneously measuring absolute angles of rotation and angular rotational rates. The measurements are made directly from the position and velocity of the device without the need for electronic integration or differentiation. The gyroscope of the invention measures angle directly, avoiding the integration of electronic errors and allowing for higher performance in attitude measurement. The capability to simultaneously measure angular rate allows flexibility for the end user who can use the device for rate and angle measurement without additional electronics. These performance improvements and flexibility in usage would allow for long term attitude sensing applications such as implantable prosthetics, micro-vehicle navigation, structural health monitoring, and long range smart munitions.

    "published_date": "05/22/2012",
    "ip_description": "The present invention relates generally to speech processing strategies, and more particularly to adapting speech coders to improve the performance of cochlear implants. Cochlear implant performance is improved by extracting pitch information and encoding such pitch information into the processor of a cochlear implant. One embodiment of the invention is to explicitly extract the pitch and deliver it to the cochlear implant by co-varying the stimulated site and rate. Another embodiment of the invention is to implicitly encode the pitch information via a code book that serves as the carrier of stimulation in the cochlear implant. When the development of speech processing strategies in cochlear implants is compared to that of speech coding algorithms in modern communication, it is apparent that, except for specific earlier versions which used a feature extraction strategy, all current cochlear implants are based on the \u201cchannel vocoder\u201d concept. This concept was first conceived and implemented by Horner Dudley at Bell Labs (Dudley 1939). The \u201cchannel vocoder\u201d concept, as illustrated in FIG. 1, involves an initial extraction of band-specific temporal envelopes followed by extraction of voice pitch (if the sound was voiced). The extracted band-specific temporal envelopes are then used to amplitude modulate either a periodic pulse train that corresponds to the voice pitch (if the sound was voiced) or a noise (if the sound was unvoiced). Unfortunately, speech synthesized using this channel vocoder concept may be intelligible but may also have a \u201cmachine-like\u201d sound quality due to inaccuracy in pitch extraction and/or other factors. Until recently, the temporal envelope has been thought to be the major cue contributing to speech intelligibility, while fine structure has been thought to contribute mostly to sound quality and speaker identification. However, it now appears that fine structure is crucial to speech recognition in noise, particularly when noise is another competing voice. As such, encoding temporal fine structure in cochlear implants remains a significant challenge. The problem is that while continuous-interleaved-stimulation (CIS) strategies may improve the temporal envelope representation, they all but totally discard the temporal fine structure. Additionally, recently-proposed strategies using higher filter density at low frequencies than at high frequencies to improve fundamental frequency (F0) encoding have the unfortunate drawback of reduced filter density at high frequencies which degrades speech intelligibility. Therefore, methods and apparatus for adapting speech coders to improve cochlear implant performance are needed. Disclosed and claimed herein are methods and apparatus for improving sound processing by a cochlear implant. In one embodiment, a method includes receiving sound containing a voiced component, extracting pitch information from said sound for the voiced component, and adding the pitch information into a continuous-interleaved-stimulation processor of the cochlear implant.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The invention relates to the field of micromachined gyroscopes and accelerometers, and in particular to designs for anti-phase devices to compensate for fabrication and environmental variations. A method of operating an anti-phase six degree-of-freedom tuning fork gyroscope system comprises the steps of driving a first three degree-of-freedom gyroscope subsystem, and driving a second three degree-of freedom gyroscope subsystem in an anti-phase mode with the first gyroscope subsystem at an anti-phase resonant frequency. Acceleration or an angular rate of motion is sensed by the first and second three degree-of-freedom gyroscope subsystems operating in a flat frequency response range where the anti-phase resonant frequency is designed. Response gain and phase are stable and environmental and fabrication perturbations are avoided by such operation. A anti-phase six degree-of-freedom tuning fork gyroscope system which operates as described is also characterized. In recent years, the development of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and the improvement of fabrication techniques have opened new avenues for the development of low-cost sensors. This is especially true for inertial sensors, more specifically micromachined gyroscopes which have shown enormous potential for a wide range of applications. When two masses are oscillating with a 180 degrees phase difference, they are considered to be moving in opposite directions. This type of motion is referred to as \u201canti-phase,\u201d since they are oscillating out of phase with exact opposite motion paths. Typically, this technique is employed in the drive direction of vibratory gyroscopic devices which have come to be known as tuning fork gyroscopes. The advantage of such devices is that the induced sense response due to the input angular rate will also be an anti-phase oscillatory motion among the two masses. This means that inputs such as environmental noise and acceleration loads, which cause the masses to respond in phase (called common mode inputs), can be cancelled by utilizing differential sensing techniques. One drawback to such a device is that the motion of both the drive and sense masses must be precisely in anti-phase so that the device can indeed reject common mode stimuli. In practice, due to inevitable imperfections in the mechanical structure, there are issues with maintaining precise anti-phase motion in both the drive and the sense directions. Methods for achieving this motion in the drive direction have been proposed including device designs and control architectures that force anti-phase motion, but this adds complexity to the system. Another problem that is often overlooked in tuning fork devices is maintaining the anti-phase response of the sense mode, specifically the potentially large phase variations that can occur when operating at or very near resonant frequencies. A method of avoiding this phase stability issue in both drive and sense is to operate the device off resonance where the phase remains relatively unchanged for small frequency fluctuations. However, the sensitivity of the device is sacrificed drastically when advantage of sense-mode resonance is not utilized. What is needed is a gyroscope design that alleviates problems commonly seen in conventional devices. The illustrated embodiment of the invention introduces a multi-degree of freedom design approach to gyroscope devices that are driven in anti-phase for the passive relaxation of sense mode phase matching requirements. A six degree-of-freedom micromachined gyroscope with anti-phase drive for the measurement of angular rate is disclosed. The gyroscope is comprised of two three degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) subsystems coupled in the drive-mode and driven into anti-phase oscillation to effectively or substantially reject common-mode stimuli. Each of the 3-DOF subsystems contains two proof masses that form a 1-DOF drive oscillator and 2-DOF sense oscillator, mechanically decoupled via a decoupling frame. The two 1-DOF drive oscillators are connected together with a flexure, thus making the overall drive a 2-DOF coupled system. Directly coupling the two drive subsystems provides a common anti-phase drive-mode resonant frequency, at which the two gyroscopic subsystems naturally oscillate in opposite directions. The 2-DOF sense-mode oscillators of each gyroscopic subsystem provide a flat range in their frequency response, where the response gain and phase are stable. The gain and phase stability of this range leads to robustness to imperfections and environmental influences, and provides precise matching of sense-mode amplitude and phase of the two gyroscopic subsystems. In the illustrated design, the flat frequency response ranges of each 2-DOF sense-mode oscillators are overlapped, and the anti-phase drive resonant frequency (at which the overall device is operated) is located within the overlapping flat ranges. The resulting six-degree of freedom dynamical system eliminates amplitude and phase stability problems of conventional tuning-fork micromachined gyroscopes to minimize bias and effectively reject common-mode stimuli.",

    "ip_description": "The invention relates to the field of micromachined gyroscopes, and in particular to inertial micromachined transducers for measurement of angular rotation rate of an object. A three-degrees of freedom (DOF) MEMS inertial micromachined gyroscope with nonresonant actuation with a drive direction, sense direction and a direction perpendicular to the drive and sense directions comprises a planar substrate, a 2-DOF sense-mode oscillator coupled to the substrate operated at a flattened wide-bandwidth frequency region, and a 1-DOF drive mode oscillator coupled operated at resonance in the flattened wide-bandwidth frequency region to achieve large drive-mode amplitudes. The illustrated embodiment of the invention show a robust micromachined gyroscope with a two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) sense mode oscillator, which gyroscope addresses two major MEMS gyroscope design challenges: (1) the requirement of precisely matching drive and sense resonance modes, and (2) inherent instability and drift due to mechanical coupling between the drive and sense modes. The device measures angular rate of an object with respect to the axis normal to the substrate plane (the z-axis). One of the major differences of the illustrated embodiment of the invention from prior art micromachined gyroscopes is that the sense-mode oscillator is a two-DOF dynamical system comprised of two interconnected proof-masses. The two-DOF sense-mode oscillator provides a frequency response with two resonant peaks and a flat region between the peaks, instead of a single resonance peak as in conventional gyroscopes. The device is nominally operated in the flat region of the sense-mode response curve, where the gain is less sensitive to parameter fluctuations. Furthermore, the sensitivity is improved by utilizing dynamical amplification of oscillations in the two-DOF sense-mode oscillator. To eliminate the limitations of the existing micromachined gyroscopes including high sensitivity to variations in system parameters and narrow bandwidth, complexity of the control electronics can be shifted to complexity in the dynamical system. Thus, increased bandwidth and reduced sensitivity to structural and thermal parameter fluctuations and damping changes are achieved, leading to improved robustness and long-term stability over the operating time of the device. Prototype gyroscopes were fabricated using a bulk-micromachining process, and were successfully operated in the flat region of the sense-mode. The performance and robustness of the device have been experimentally evaluated. With a 25V DC bias and 3V AC drive signal resulting in 5.8 \u03bcm drive-mode amplitude, the gyroscope exhibited a measured noise-floor of 0.640/s/pHz over 50 Hz bandwidth in atmospheric pressure. The sense-mode response in the flat operating region was also experimentally demonstrated to be inherently insensitive to pressure, temperature and DC bias variations.",

    "ip_description": "Corneal blindness accounts for 50% of blindness in developing countries and artificial corneas need in scenarios in which a donor cornea is unusable or unavailable. Artificial corneas suffer from a myriad of problems ranging from mechanically weak corneas at junction sites to the necessity of lifetime antibiotic administration for the patient. This technology is a one piece artificial cornea that is biocompatible, durable and naturally antimicrobial/antibacterial. Artificial corneas are necessary in cases in which donor corneas are not available or usable. Upon implantation, there needs to be a delicate balance between protecting the corneal device from overgrowth of host cells (to maintain corneal transparency) and promoting host-cell integration. Current strategies to achieve this balance involve using chemical coatings or \u201cporous\u201d patterns to achieve the appropriate level of cellular adhesion. Neither of these solutions are ideal because chemical coatings can decompose over time while \u201cporous\u201d patterns are difficult to manufacture consistently. This technology utilizes nanopatterns to create a mixed cellular adhesion environment that will both promote and deter cellular adhesion on an artificial cornea. The single-piece artificial cornea is made from already FDA approved materials that are known to be biocompatible. Unlike other artificial corneas, this implant has no material junctions, making the device mechanically stronger and not subjectable to adhesive failure. This artificial cornea will consist of an optic zone and a peripheral skirt. Precisely defined nanoscopic features can be etched onto the surface of the implant such that host cell adhesion will not be deterred at the optic zone while promoting adhesion and integration at the peripheral skirt. Another important aspect of this technology is that patients receiving this implant will not require lifetime administration of antibiotics as the nanopatterns provide antimicrobial and antibacterial properties to the artificial cornea.",

    "ip_description": "Many electronic devices rely on integrated circuits, whereby different electrical components are incorporated into a single chip and connected to one another through interposers. Researchers at UCI and Integra have developed a new interposer that allows for a high density of electrical connections, and whose fabrication is cheaper and easier than conventional methods. Modern electronics typically consist of several different types of electrical components that, for ease-of-use and production, are ideally condensed into a single chip by vertically stacking component layers. Device functionality necessitates that these various components quickly and effectively communicate with one another, a feat accomplished by interposers. Interposers are thin films of insulating material that are sandwiched between the components; electrical contact is established by metal-filled conducting channels (\u201cvias\u201d) that are bored through the interposer, connecting the sandwiching components. A high density of vias facilitates effective electrical communication. The most common interposer material is silicon, which, in addition to being expensive, requires extensive processing to create adequate film thinness and smoothness. Achieving desirable via depth also requires several iterations of boring through the silicon, which is a long and costly process. The next most widely used interposer material, glass, is less costly and more easily implemented than silicon. Its brittle and fragile nature, however, limit the density of vias that can be established. Recently, researchers at UCI and Integra Devices, LLC have developed a new interposer material and fabrication technique based on anodic aluminum oxide (AAO). Its production is less expensive and time-consuming than that of silicon, and it can withstand a high density of vias, unlike glass. Vias are bored through the AAO interposer in a single (rather than iterative) process. Additionally, the AAO interposer requires very little post-processing: film thickness is highly controllable through careful tuning of film growth conditions, and the resulting interposer can be adequately smoothed by simply polishing by hand. The AAO interposers have been fabricated and tested, and have been shown to produce a high density of successful copper vias. Advantages include: Interposer film thickness is easily controlled, high density of vias are easily bored through the entire film depth in a single process, less costly and time-consuming than previous silicon-based interposers, and offers increased stability and via density over glass-based interposers.",

    "ip_description": "Many applications, ranging from in vivo cell culture growth to drug delivery, rely on microcapsules to encapsulate and protect cells or molecules until their desired release. These microcapsules are typically generated in immiscible fluid, which must be depleted before they can be effectively used. Researchers at UCI have recently developed a paper-based microcapsule extraction technique that is quicker, cheaper, and less damaging than conventional methods.\n\nMicroencapsulation is a common method in a variety of fields for containing and protecting systems of interest until they are required to be released/utilized. In in vivo studies of cell growth, for example, entire cells are encapsulated in hydrophilic polymer beads (hydrogels) which protect them from immune response and damaging external forces. The generation of these microstructures leaves them suspended in an oil phase, which must be removed to bring them to application in aqueous phase. The current state-of-the-art method for this removal relies on repetitive steps of centrifugal purification. However, this technique must be conducted off-chip (externally performed), leads to low recovery yields, and reduces size uniformity of microcapsules. For cell-encasing microcapsules, this process provokes cell death.\n\nThe technology consists of a lab-on-a-chip platform generated using soft lithography and the layer-by-layer assembly scheme. The user\u2019s oil-based precursor solution, containing any solid matter of interest, is passed through a flow-focusing junction to generate the monodisperse microcapsules. The microcapsules then pass through an outlet chamber, which is lined with hydrophobic filter paper. The filter paper absorbs the oil phase without disturbance of its contents. The microcapsules are resuspended in a water-based salt solution (phosphate-buffered saline), undestroyed and ready for application or delivery. The present invention describes a rapid and one-step process of oil extraction. Hydrophobic to hydrophilic phase exchange is achieved in a single, on-chip step. This high-throughput method maintains cell viability and size uniformity of microcapsules, thereby increasing recovery yield as fewer microstructures are destroyed.",

    "ip_description": "The technology relates to cavity resonators and filters for improved processing of electromagnetic signals. Specifically, the invention is a cavity resonator or filter that is constructed on electromagnetic bandgap substrate that includes an external controlling assemble can change the work frequency of the cavity resonator or filter. This enables device access to frequencies with a very broad range. Today\u2019s technologies such as smart phones and tablets utilize multiple frequency bands for wireless communications. Smart phones use radio frequency (RF) band to cover services such as GSM, GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, 3G or 4G LTE. In order handle the different types of functions, a compact bandpass RF/microwave filter is needed to cover multiple working frequencies. This is an essential component when creating more integrated solutions for these handheld communication devices. There has been great interest in the field of wireless communications to find a platform that can enable long-range wireless network that can access frequencies from 2 to 11 GHz. Currently, there are filters that can cover a small range of frequencies including planar microstrip filters that work within frequencies of 1.178-3.6GHZ and 4.14-6.26GHz or capacitive-post loaded evanescent mode cavities cover 0.98-3.48GHz and 1.9-5GHz. For these reasons, electromagnetic bandgap filters has emerged as an alternative design due to its high Qu, ease of integration and low costs. University of CA researchers have created a tunable cavity filter that is able to work with a broad range of frequencies. This electromagnetic bandgap filter is much smaller than traditional filters and can be easily integrated in an industry-standard printed circuit board thereby facilitating high-volume manufacturing and lower cost fabrication. Overall, this technology will improve the wireless communications and specifically the mobile devices that we all use everyday. There are many types of EBG substrates that the filters can be built on such as Silicon, SIGaAs, SI InP, glass or LCP. This ensures high level of RF microelectronics with tunable filters In addition, the filters can also be used in combination with other external components such as inductors, capacitors, varactors, or PIN diodes on the various EBG substrates for tunable filters. Lastly, this technology can be used in collaborations with PCB vendors to develop and include an integrated RT module, which can include filters, transformers, matching network, switches, and passive components. Advantages include flexibility in selection of components of the control elements, built-in control elements containing a plurality of tuning components, the use of 3D evanescent mode filters, a tuning frequency range that does not rely on the via post size and height, easy integration with other components, high-volume manufacturing and low cost fabrication, retention of high Qu of cavity resonators and wide spurious free region, freedom from working frequency band limitation, and provision of an ultra wide frequency range.",

    "ip_description": "One of the key identifiers of cancer is an interruption in normal cellular life cycles, including pre-programmed cell death. Researchers at UCI have recently developed a method to monitor this cell death via graphene-based sensors which provide increased accuracy and allow for a higher degree of cancer treatment personalization over traditional techniques. Multicellular organisms, such as mammals, rely on pre-programmed cell death (apoptosis) for normal cell development and maintenance. Apoptosis is an irreversible process that, once started, cannot be undone and as such is highly regulated within cells. Several diseases, including cancer, can interrupt the natural onset of apoptosis, which necessitates a method for reliably detecting and monitoring its progression. Due to its irreversible nature, most apoptosis sensing techniques detect the first step in the cellular death process. This corresponds to a rush of charge across the outer membrane of the mitochondria, called mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). MOMP is monitored optically by light-emitting fluorescent molecules that are placed outside the mitochondrial membrane; the intensity of light emitted by these molecules is reduced as the electronic environment changes with the onset of MOMP. Standard fluorescent-based techniques require ~10,000 cells to generate accurate assessments. Recently, researchers at UCI have developed an inexpensive electronic apoptosis sensing technique. This method utilizes electrodes constructed from graphene, an atomically-thin carbon sheet. The graphene is functionalized with an antibody that binds selectively to a protein on the mitochondrial outer membrane, effectively anchoring the mitochondria to the sheet. By monitoring the electrical charge across the sheet, researchers were able to effectively detect the onset of apoptosis in the mitochondria through a drop in the graphene conductance. Most notably, this platform requires less cells (as little as 7,000 cell in the test area) to generate accurate results. Researchers posit that this number can be even further reduced as the sensor is scaled down to cellular dimensions. This technology has important implications in tumor biopsies -- with fewer cells needed to accurately profile the tumor, this platform offers a quicker and more accurate method for the crafting of individualized cancer treatments.",

    "ip_description": "Automotive-based wireless communications rely on broadcasting signals over public channels, which must be encrypted due to their vulnerability to hacking by outside sources. Recently, researchers at UCI have developed a technique which utilizes the random motion of the vehicle to provide more secure and less energetically costly encryption over standard protocols. Wireless communication has become ubiquitous in automobiles, as it is responsible for many aspects of intra-vehicular monitoring, and also allows for the implementation of common technologies such as Bluetooth, WiFi, and satellite GPS. These wirelessly transmitted signals, whether traveling within or to an automotive, are broadcast over a public channel that is susceptible to attack from an outside source. These attacks may allow a third party to hijack a vehicle from a remote source, or access drivers' personal information. Increasing the randomness with which the transmitted signal is encrypted provides increased security against these third party attacks. Current encryption in automotives is largely based on pseudo-random key generation, which places additional energy, memory, and performance demands on the vehicle. Researchers at UCI have developed a novel key generation technique which instead utilizes the physical randomness provided by a moving automotive. The channel experiences spatial and temporal variations in the environment as the vehicle moves; these physical variations are truly random and as such, the keys generated in this manner are nearly impossible to predict or extract. Additionally, rather than relying on a single, pre-stored key, a new key is generated for each communication session. This technique provides increased security over standard procedures, while simultaneously reducing energy and performance overhead.",

To study diseases and cellular mechanisms, biologists need to be able to efficiently synthesize, isolate and purify proteins. The invention herein is a synthetic nanoparticle (NP) that protects proteins from aggregation at temperatures, which normally cause aggregation. Furthermore, multiple stimuli can release the protein in high yield from the NPs. After a protein is synthesized, it folds into its most thermodynamically favorable state, or its native state. Thermal stress, heating a protein above its native state, can cause aggregation of proteins. Protein aggregation leads to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. To study these diseases, biologists need to efficiently synthesize, isolate and purify proteins. A major factor in the cost and efficiency of protein production is a loss of purified proteins resulting from protein aggregation. Researchers at UCI have developed a synthetic organic polymer nanoparticle (NP), which can prevent protein aggregation. When combining IgG proteins with this novel NP, NP-IgG complexes show thermal stability and prevent aggregation of IgG proteins. Furthermore, multiple stimuli (pH, salt concentration, and temperature) were able to release bound IgG in high yield. Preventing protein aggregation using the novel NP will allow biologists to efficiently studying proteins and could lead to treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.",

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical technique used to create high-resolution, 3D images of the internal structure of objects that scatter light. The technique has established usage in the medical field for applications such as retinal imaging and more recently, imaging of vasculature through attachments to catheters. Though the primary focus of OCT has been in biomedical applications, the technique has the broader potential to image any optically scattering object. UCI inventors have created an imaging system which uses OCT to collect high-resolution, 3D images of cut gemstones in order to precisely analyze characteristics such as overall quality, defects, and weight all of which are considerations in determining the gemstone\u2019s market value. The technique is non-damaging to the gemstones, and they may be left in their settings, decreasing the potential for damage to the settings. Additionally, the system provides an option to immerse the gemstone in a refractive index-matched nanoparticle-containing media, which uses its reflective properties to circumvent signal losses (these signal losses are due to internal reflections of the incident OCT light within the gemstones).",

Described here is a novel device capable of producing MNB solutions that can be used to preserve viability and function of such organs/tissue.

Micro and nanobubbles (MNBs) provide a novel technology that is capable of delivering oxygen to wounds or tissue being harvested for transplant. These solutions can be applied to a variety of contexts, particularly in modern combat injuries (typically characterized by explosive wounds that can result in soft tissue defects with high risk of contamination and burns) and in the case of tissue/organ transplants. Currently, there generators for micro and nanobubbles are bulky and hard to translate into medical devices. Researchers at UCI have developed a novel device that can generate MNBs.
