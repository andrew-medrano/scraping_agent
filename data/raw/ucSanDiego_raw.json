    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego have developed RadSenNet, a new approach of sequential fusing of information from radars and cameras. The key idea of sequential fusion is to fundamentally shift the center of focus in radar-camera fusion systems from cameras to radars. This shift enables their invention (RadSegNet) to achieve all-weather perception benefits of radar sensing. Keeping radars as the primary modality ensures reliability in all situations including occlusions, longrange and bad weather.\n\nPerception systems for autonomous driving have seen significant advancements in their performance over last few years. However, these systems struggle to show robustness in extreme weather conditions because sensors like lidars and cameras, which are the primary sensors in a sensor suite, see a decline in performance under these conditions. In order to solve this problem, camera-radar fusion systems provide a unique opportunity for all weather reliable high quality perception. Cameras provides rich semantic information while radars can work through occlusions and in all weather conditions. In this work we show that the state-of-the-art fusion methods perform poorly when camera input is de-graded, which essentially results in losing the all-weather reliability they set out to achieve.\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego have developed RadSenNet, a new approach of sequential fusing of information from radars and cameras. The key idea of sequential fusion is to fundamentally shift the center of focus in radar-camera fusion systems from cameras to radars. This shift enables their invention (RadSegNet) to achieve all-weather perception benefits of radar sensing. Keeping radars as the primary modality ensures reliability in all situations including occlusions, longrange and bad weather.  \n  \nRadSegNet architects the sequential fusion by decoupling the simultaneous feature extraction from both the cameras and radars, used in state-of-art architectures. Instead, features are sequentially extracted first from the camera and then propagated to radar point clouds, thus retaining reliable  \nradar inputs at all times along with a hint of semantic information from cameras. This is the first technology that performs all-weather reliable sensor fusion of radar point clouds and camera images, at long ranges, while keeping radars as the primary sensing modality.  \n  \nA fusion between the camera and radar modalities can be performed in multiple ways. Some approaches do late fusion, wherein individual detections from multiple modalities are combined, but, here, we can not learn any joint representation or perform joint feature extraction. Alternatively, there exist early fusion approaches that work in two ways. Some works project radar points to camera perspective view RGB image, but operating in perspective view makes it harder to distinguish between small objects close to the sensor and large objects at a longer range. Others perform an inverse mapping of the camera's RGB image to radar's Bird's eye view (BEV) but an inverse mapping of the camera to BEV plane is ill-defined due to the lack of depth information in-camera images.  \n  \nTo solve the problems in late and early fusion techniques, the state-of-the-art approaches perform middle fusion or feature-level fusion. These approaches use multi-view feature aggregation from radar and image data. For a particular object region proposal, features are fused from radar point clouds and camera images simultaneously. Unfortunately, it turns out that this simultaneous feature extraction approach for camera and radar fusion has a heavy reliance on cameras. The performance severely degrades in cases where the camera input is degraded, like in bad weather conditions. We propose a new fusion method, that treats Radars as the primary sensor which truly achieves all-weather reliability, essentially solving all the problems mentioned above.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego present a fully-passive, miniaturized, flexible form factor sensor interface titled ZenseTag that uses minimal electronics to read and communicate analog sensor data, directly at radio frequencies (RF). The technology exploits the fundamental principle of resonance, where a sensor's terminal impedance becomes most sensitive to the measured stimulus at its resonant frequency. This enables ZenseTag to read out the sensor variation using only energy harvested from wireless signals.\n\nUCSD inventors further demonstrate its implementation with a 15x10mm flexible PCB that connects sensors to a printed antenna and passive RFID ICs, enabling near real-time readout through a performant GUI-enabled software. They showcase ZenseTag's versatility by interfacing commercial force, soil moisture and photodiode sensors.\n\nSensors enable us to digitally capture stimuli like moisture, light, and force. Despite their low cost, reliability, and scalability, the lack of widespread adoption ofloT has hindered the realization of true ubiquitous sensing. A likely reason is that the current sensor platforms are bulky due to the batteries and complex electronics needed to interface sensors communication systems.\n\nThis patent-pending invention teaches how to interface any commercial sensor with RFID reader to enable passive sensing, while also addressing the problem of signal corruption by channel multipath. The inventors validated the hypothesis of true differential sensing using the twin\u2010tag single antenna architecture in a small form factor; also validating the ability of their sensing platform to interface readily with any commercial two\u2010terminal sensor that shows an impedance response at radio\u2010frequencies.  \n  \nThe researchers successfully tested their sensing platforms with commercially sourced capacitive soil moisture sensor, force sensitive resistor, and photodiode. They demonstrated that this method of passive wireless sensing can be deployed in the presence of dynamic environments and can be used to obtain sensor readings in near\u2010real time.\n\nImproved Analog readout for COTS sensors: We methodically profile the impedance of commercial 2-terminal COTS sensors at RF (902-928 MHz used by RFID systems), accounting for parasitic effects to enable Direct-to-RF Interfacing of COTS Sensors. Furthermore this interfacing technique can be extended to any other RF wireless technology.  \n  \nMore importantly, ZenseTag utilizes the novel concept of impedance-resonance effect exhibited by two-terminal commercial sensors modeled as R-L-C circuits at particular frequencies where they maximally couple the stimulus to the backscatter signal. We demonstrate for the first time, how generic sensors that were hitherto posed as a challenge to work with at RF can be made responsive at the appropriate frequencies using simple passive components.  \n  \n\u2022 Generality of Sensing: We demonstrated that ZenseTag works with three commercial sensors, enabling various applications. This technique can also be applied to any sensor with terminal impedance variation.  \n  \n\u2022 Robust analog sensing with a Miniaturized, Flexible, COTS compatible PCB: ZenseTag interfaces the frequency tuned sensor with two RFID tags using a Twin-Tag SingleAntenna Sensor Interface, such that one tag is modulated with the sensor stimuli, while other is isolated. This is done with just a 15mm x 10mm flexible PCB that connects these three components: sensor and the two RFID tags, to a single printed RFID antenna. The RFID reader then decodes the analog sensor data by comparing the relative channel measurements from the two tags.  \n  \n\u2022 Low-latency RFID reader software: We read the tags using a COTS RFID reader (Impinj Speedway) and an opensource library, SLLURP that can be implemented on any general purpose computing platform. Using a PyQTdesigned GUI, we show near real-time sensor readout, as highlighted in our demo videos for force, soil moisture and light intensity sensing.  \n  \n\u2022 Power Consumption: We highlight that the ZenseTag platform consumes no power beyond what the RFlD tags use, operating solely on RF harvesting from a reader without needing additional energy sources.\n\nUCSD researchers have presented ZenseTag, a compact, battery-free, wireless sensing platform that can interface commercially available sensors to inexpensive, flexible commercial RFID stickers. Through innovative approaches such as direct-RF interface, sensor resonance tuning and twin-tag-single-antenna interface, ZenseTag achieves superior reliability and accuracy in differential analog sensing of stimuli such as soil moisture, light intensity and contact forces.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego developed a patent-pending novel Synthesis of Virtual Array Manifold (SVAM) sensing approach for the mmWave single RF chain systems. More specifically, this new technology for sensing leads to faster and more robust beam alignment. UCSD believes this contribution will have significant impact on the traditional paradigm for sensing in mmWave systems.\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego have developed a novel sensing approach for millimeter wave systems with limited radio frequency (RF) chains, including the single RF chain system. This technology is inspired from the synthetic aperture radar systems, and presents a paradigm shift. The inventors have provided different design considerations for sensing under the new paradigm that enable rich sensing even with limited RF chains. The measurements collected using the sensing technology opens up myriad options for beam alignment, channel estimation, multi-user detection and transmission. This invention offers novel options for detection (powerbased inference) and estimation, for the beam alignment problem, that this sensing framework enables.\u00a0 Moreover, this sensing technology enables avenues to improve inference by adapting the spatial beamformer. The engineering team refer to this broad framework for sensing as Synthesis of Virtual Array Manifolds (SVAM).\n\nMillimeter wave and 5G (and beyond) technologies are promising and exciting because of the high data rates and many use cases that it enables. The technology is also challenging because of the channel characteristics and the hardware constraints.\n\nThe presented sensing methodology impacts the many use cases and addresses the challenges posed by communications in the millimeter wave spectrum.\n\nThese include a wide range of applications where signal from multiple antennas is processed e.g., in millimeter wave wireless systems such as UE and gNodeB for beam alignment, channel estimation, multi-user detection and transmission as well as millimeter wave radar systems.\n\nThe novel sensing technology provides a systematic mechanism for capturing highly informative measurements. The sensing exploits the millimeter wave channel statistics and the geometry of the antenna array to take measurements that carry information about the unknown angle of arrival and the small-scale fading coefficient. Such emphasis on sensing under the extreme hardware constraints such as a single RF chain system is novel. Moreover this new sensing based measurements can be easily utilized within a broad class of beam alignment algorithms. A detailed comparison with existing literature is made in the accompanying manuscript.\n\nIn their publication, the UC San Diego researchers propose a novel inference scheme that estimates a posterior density on the small-scale fading coefficient and the unknown dominant path angle. Based on the proposed inference procedure, an adaptive beamforming scheme is provided that aims to collect high SNR measure- ments. Finally, the performance of the proposed active sensing scheme is evaluated under different scenarios, and a significant improvement over various benchmarks is demonstrated.  \n  \nThe published empirical study, see _**Pote & Rao, 2024**_ (reference below), also reveals the impact of the different design parameters on the beam alignment performance.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego and Oregon Health Science Univeristy developed a microelectrode grid for continuous interoperative neuromonitoring. The microelectrode grid includes a flexible substrate with low impedance electrochemical interface materials on conducting metal pads. The metal pads are connectable to stimulation/acquisition electronics through metal lead interconnects forming stimulation and recording channels and eventually to bonding pads. A flap within the substrate is movable away from the remainder of the substrate while at least some of the metal pads on the remainder of the substrate can remain in contact with an organ when the flap is moved away from the remainder of the substrate.\n\nBackground.\n\nThe ECoG grids are conventionally used before resecting the brain tissues to delineate the functional and diseased boundaries. Together with the pre-surgical fMRI, the ECoG functional mapping is a powerful tool the neurosurgeons use to distinguish pathological tissues from healthy tissues and determine the resection boundary. However, the conventional ECoG grid does not provide cIONM because the electrode blocks the surgical field.\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego and Oregon Health Science Univeristy developed a microelectrode grid for continuous interoperative neuromonitoring.\u00a0 The team of researchers have revolutionized the ECoG neuromonitoring practice by allowing cIONM while functioning as conventional ECoG grid and recording in the regions surrounding, and if desired within, the resected tissue.  \n  \nThe invention is related to a novel electrophysiological grid, a new form of electrocorticography (ECoG) microelectrode grid, part of which can be displaced from the tissue while the other parts of the grid remain in intimate contact with tissue: This is accomplished with a foldable flap structure that allows part of the grid to be flipped back away from tissue and then placed back on tissue when needed. This approach enables the continuous intraoperative neuromonitoring (cIONM) of the brain state and its activity during the resective neurosurgery. The flap located on the grid can be opened and closed, allowing the surgical tools to access and resect the brain tissue through the inner window of the microelectrode. The surrounding microelectrode recording channels outside the circular flap region are capable of continuously monitoring the ECoG activities during the entire neurosurgery. The capability to do cIONM and provide live feedback to the neurosurgeon are crucial in preserving essential functions on the human brain and may improve patient outcome.",

Application of the algorithm to an input of lung CT image data provides accurate quantification of air trapping measurements in a broad cohort of patients with a wide range of pulmonary air trapping. The inventive approach reduces inference runtime, improves lobar overlap, and reduces voxel \"folding.\"\n\nImage registration is the process of identifying a spatial transformation that maps two (pair-wise registration) or more (group-wise registration) images to a common coordinate frame so that corresponding anatomical structures are optimally aligned. In other words, a voxel-wise \"correspondence\" needs to be established between the images. Automated co-registration is an essential feature of nearly all medical imaging applications, however, co-registration can be computationally expensive and particularly challenging for imaging of deformable organs, an extreme example of which is the lungs. The registration of inspirative and expirative lung CT images has important medical applications in the diagnosis and characterization of small airway disease and emphysema. Using accurate pulmonary registration, the local lung ventilation can be reliably quantified.\n\nDiseases affecting the small airways, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),bronchiolitis obliterans related to stem cell transplantation or chronic lung allograft dysfunction, and cystic fibrosis, can manifest as pulmonary air trapping, which can go undetected on routine inspiratory chest CT. For each of these diseases, chronic inflammation and obstruction of the small airways limit the rate and volume of gas expulsion during expiratory phase, which is typically diagnosed via pulmonary function testing (PFT) through measurement of FEVl and FEVl/FVC.\n\nAlthough air trapping may sometimes be observed as mosaic attenuation on expiratory phase CT, evidence has shown that diffuse air trapping can be difficult to detect visually. In contrast, quantitative measurements on a dedicated inspiratory/expiratory lung CT protocol can facilitate air trapping assessment, which has been shown to prognosticate both disease progression and mortality.\n\nThe inventive CNN-based deformable lung registration algorithm disclosed herein accurately quantifies air trapping measurements in a broad cohort of patients with a wide range of pulmonary air trapping, reduces inference runtime, improves lobar overlap, and reduces voxel \"folding.\" Fast, fully-automated CNN-based lung deformable registration algorithms can facilitate translation of these measurements into clinical practice, potentially improving the diagnosis and severity assessment of small airway diseases.",

    "ip_description": "The strategy employed by the invention is inspired by splicing factors, a category of RNA-binding protein that influence alternative splicing outcomes. These splicing factors are trans-acting, and act to enhance or silence exon inclusion by binding near or on the target exon and promoting or repressing the activity of splicing machinery. Scientifically, a highly programmable, minimally disruptive system to increase exon inclusion could allow for higher-throughput identification of functional roles of specific exons than have been previously shown.\n\nAlternative splicing is a co- and post-transcriptional processing step in which certain regions of transcribed pre-mRNA are included or skipped from the final mRNA product depending on the regulatory environment at the time of processing. Alternative splicing is a major source of expanded protein diversity over the raw number of genes in the genome, with virtually all human protein coding genes expressing multiple alternatively spliced isoforms. Mis-regulation of this process has been implicated in many diseases.\u00a0\u00a0 Targeted modulation of alternative splicing presents an opportunity for therapeutics, by correcting mis-splicing of specific RNA targets, and for scientific inquiry, by functionally probing individual splicing events. Approaches have been taken to induce the skipping of alternative exons. Targeted inclusion, however, is less common since the blunt approaches of inhibiting splicing mechanisms by targeted destruction or steric inhibition of splicing signals at the target is not a viable strategy.\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego have developed a scalable approach to identify known and novel proteins that enhance inclusion of alternatively spliced exons when placed in proximity to the target exon. Engineering is informed by a large-scale assay of naturally occurring/expressed human RNA-binding proteins to determine the strongest splicing factors that when tethered close to a target exon causes inclusion. The resulting list of natural candidates is utilized for the optimization of the synthetic, targeted systems for tunable strength and minimal size.\u00a0\u00a0 This invention consists of the list of RNA binding proteins identified through the large-scale assay, engineered effector protein domains optimized using these results, and the use of these with RNA-targeting modalities to induce the inclusion of targeted exons.\n\nThis invention can be used for many applications depending on the specifics of the target exons, including but not limited to modulation of gene expression and correction of aberrant splicing. Therapeutically, genetically encoded exon inclusion is of relevance to many diseases, including cancer and spinal muscular atrophy, where the concept is currently applied therapeutically.",

This newly disclosed improved technology reduces the number of steps and the number of metal layers used to increase the biocompatibility and device yield, as compared to an earlier disclosure for NEAs that were fabricated using a different process.\n\nBackground. In biological and clinical research, patch-clamp is the gold-standard and most widely used and efficient technique to probe the dynamic potential fluctuations and ion-gate current exchanges in excitable cells.\u00a0 However, patch-clamp is quite invasive and doesn\u2019t meet the needs to scale to large densities, long term, and intracellular electrophysiological intervention. And while microelectrode arrays (MEAs) enable long-term recordings from networks of neurons, they measure extracellular potentails and therefore lack the sensitivity to subthreshold potential oscillations that are important features for drug screening.\n\nIntracellular access with high spatiotemporal resolution can enhance the understanding of how neurons or cardiomyocytes regulate and orchestrate network activity and how this activity can be affected with pharmacology or other interventional modalities. Nanoscale devices often employ electroporation to transiently permeate the cell membrane and record intracellular potentials, which tend to decrease rapidly with time.\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego have invented an innovative scalable, vertical, ultrasharp nanowire arrays that are individually addressable to enable long-term, native recordings of intracellular potentials. One reports electrophysiological recordings that are indicative of intracellular access from 3D tissue-like networks of neurons and cardiomyocytes across recording days and that do not decrease to extracellular amplitudes for the duration of the recording of several minutes.\n\nThe applications of this technology are mostly in drug screening for neurodegernative and neuropsychiatric diseases, heart and muscle disease. The deviecs have broad applications in any type of penetrating devices including but not limited to biological tissue, skin, etc. Additional applications include biosensing, field-emission devices, scaffolding platforms, etc.\n\nThese new high density vertical NEAs offer minimal invasiveness, high yield, high robustness, high aspect ratio, lower impendence, high sensitivity, biocompatibility, high density, and individual addressability. This invention is a novel fabrication process for the development of of high yield nanowire electrode arrays (NEAs) with ultra-sharp tips to measure intracellular potentials from excitable cells. The nanowire arrays may find other applications in field-emission devices, light and particle detectors, etc.  \n  \n\u00a0This technology offers multiple intracellular measurements per a single cell or intracellular measurements from a large network of excitable cells. The invention provides for improved yield, high robustness, lower impedence, high density, increased sensitivity, high aspect ratio, individual addressability, minimum invasion and biocompatibility, thus enabling longitudinal measurements of cell potential\u2019s and ionic currents important for drug screening.\n\nThe cited paper below details the findings that are validated with cross-sectional microscopy, pharmacology, and electrical interventions. The experiments and simulations demonstrate that the individual electrical addressability of nanowires is necessary for high-fidelity intracellular electrophysiological recordings. This study advances the understanding of and control over high-quality multichannel intracellular recordings and paves the way toward predictive, high-throughput, and low-cost electrophysiological drug screening platforms.",

For many technical applications, precision is the key to its success, and it is necessary to have the means to carry out an efficient, site-specific, modification of the nucleic acid substrate.

Given the received message block, the decoding algorithm is designed to recover the truly transmitted symbols.  Engineers from UC San Diego have invented a decoding system that can be shown to achieve near-optimal decoding performance for general linear codes of dimension less than or equal to 128. In particular, for Reed\u2013Muller codes, this new algorithm is the first to be shown with simulation evidence to achieve the optimal block error rate for communications over binary symmetric channels. This invention employs multiple Monte Carlo Markov chain subdecoders in parallel, which is a novel idea compared to the existing art. Researchers from UC San Diego have invented a parallel block Gibbs Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) decoding algorithm for decoding linear codes. They showed through numerical experiments that, for short Reed\u2013Muller codes, the error probability of the proposed decoder is close to the optimal value achieved by the maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. The near optimality of the parallel MCMC decoder is, however, not code-specific. In fact, the engineers have also observed similar results for short blocklength low density parity check (LDPC) codes. Moreover, there are several variations of the proposed decoder that can achieve even faster convergence than the previous results. The inventors further note that the parallel MCMC algorithm has applications beyond the framework of channel decoding. The proposed idea suggests a way to build practically feasible solvers for other problems in statistical signal processing where posterior sampling offers an alternative to optimal inference. For instance, the UCSD engineers have developed a fast-converging parallel MCMC detector for signal detection in MIMO systems.

This technology achieves the above by utilizing RF switches that toggle in sync with a high sampling-rate ADCs, allowing this technology to capture multiple antenna signals interleaved across time, in essence, virtualizing the concept of a physically laid RF chain. As a consequence of the virtualization of these RF chains to the digital domain, this patent-pending invention entails a highly power-efficient, scalable, and flexible multi-user beamforming architecture, which can adapt to the number of users, the channel conditions and provide robust multi-user operation by utilizing scalability in deploying additional antennas for the architecture.\n\nFrequency-division multiple access (FDMA) is a channel access method used in some multiple-access protocols.

Together they will enable researchers to conduct experiments that would not have been possible due to weight restrictions of existing recording instruments. At present the weight of recording instruments used in small animal research is addressed by using a simple counterweight system.

The dynamic counterbalance system not only reduces the inertia of instrumented subjects but also reduces the forces experienced by the animals. This design will likely reduce the stress on the animals used in research and will increase the total weight of instruments that can be used safely in these types of research paradigms.

Surprisingly, the resulting Arg-Arg-AuNPs are stable over time as the peptide protects the particles from degradation. The assemblies can even be dried without any loss of particles. The assembly of AuNPs-citrate changes their optical properties and the color of the suspension turns from red to blue. Importantly, the assemblies can be dissociated with thiolated polyethylene glycol (HS-PEGs) molecules which leads to the recovery of the initial optical properties of the AuNPs, i.e. the red color of the suspension. Surprisingly, we have observed that such dissociation of AuNPs assemblies is not sensitive to the composition of the medium. It can thus be performed in biological fluids such as pure plasma, saliva, urine, bile, cell lysates or even sea water.\n\nThe detection of protease biomarker is performed by the conjugation of a peptide substrate to a HS-PEGs molecule. The resulting HS-PEG-peptide conjugate is either too bulky or too charged to dissociated the AuNPs assemblies. However, in the presence of the target protease, this latter cleaves the HS-PEG-peptide conjugate and there is a release of HS-PEGs fragment that can dissociate the assemblies and there is an unambiguous color change. The dissociation is complete after 30 minutes and the color change can be observed after only 5 minutes. This can be performed in any biological fluid and can be adapted to any protease as far as it is possible to find a peptide substrate.  \n  \nThis is particularly interesting because most of the nanoparticles-based sensing platforms suffer from the capacity to operate in biological fluids due to background signal caused by endogenous molecules. Finally, we have demonstrated how the assemblies dissociation with HS-PEGs can be exploited for biomarker sensing. We have shown that it is possible to conjugate, i.e. link, a peptide substrate to HS-PEGs molecules, making the resulting conjugate (HS-PEG-peptide) specific to a target protease. The presence of the protease is thus detected via the proteolytic cleavage that releases HS-PEGs fragments, inducing the dissociation of the assemblies.

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego have developed an invention that allows the continuous monitoring of atmospheric He, Ne, and H2 at unprecedented precision. This enables important new applications including in the understanding of the global carbon cycle, verifying reported natural gas emissions, and predicting earthquakes.\n\nThe invention is a cryogenic gas purification and flow-stabilizing system that is interfaced with a mass spectrometer for the high-precision analysis of these gases. Air from a sample or a reference gas alternatingly flows at a precisely stabilized flow rate through the purification system which concentrates the species of interest in the gas stream to the mass spectrometer. To allow continuous operation, the purification system consists of two switchable cryo-traps that each can be regenerated independently by a heating cycle such that one trap is used for purification while the other is regenerating.  \n  \nIn contrast to previous designs, the cryogenic trap can be regenerated automatically and with two identical traps operating in parallel, continuous measurements of the gases of interest can be achieved. Previous designs used a chemical purification system that had to be manually replaced which was labor intensive and required breaking vacuum leading to substantial down time, risks of leaks and contamination.\n\nHigh-precision measurements of atmospheric helium levels in situ and in sample flasks, enabled by the cryo-enrichment method presented here, have great potential to improve our understanding of the anthropogenic carbon cycle, to which helium is intimately connected through co-emission of\u00a0He and\u00a0CO2. The validation experiments and semi-continuous measurements of\u00a0He/M\" role=\"presentation\"> during local pollution events at Scripps Pier shown here demonstrate that the new method further improves precision and overcomes previous ease-of-use limitations of the \u201cgetter-helium\u201d method employed by Birner et\u00a0al. (2022a, 2021), thereby paving the way for establishing\u00a0He as an important part of the trace-gas toolkit in carbon cycle studies.\n\nThe cryo-trap system for He, Ne, and H2 measurements potentially field-deployable. This unprecedented capability is of particular interest for the prediction of earthquakes because previous studies have demonstrated the existence of He anomalies in natural gases and ground water associated with faulting. However, so far no continuous monitoring system exists that is capable of detecting these He changes and use them as a tool to forecast earthquakes.  \n  \nAnother technical advantage of the cryo purification system is that removes not only N2, O2, and CO2 from the air like the chemical purification system but also argon, which allows a stronger preconcentration of the gases of interest and thus the system can achieve higher precision with smaller samples than previously possible. This enables the integration of the system into a flask measuring network which will provide previously unavailable information about spatial gradients of these gases that can be used to verify reported natural gas emissions.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego have invented a new form of materials, polymer-integrated crystals (PIX), which combine the structural order of protein crystals with the dynamic, stimuli-responsive properties of synthetic polymers. The inventors have shown that the crystallinity, flexibility, and chemical tunability of PIX can be exploited to encapsulate guest proteins with high loading efficiencies. And, the electrostatic host-guest interactions enable reversible, pH-controlled uptake/release of guest proteins as well as the mutual stabilization of the host and the guest, thus creating a uniquely synergistic platform toward the development of functional biomaterials and the controlled delivery of biological macromolecules.\n\nBackground.  \nCurrent methods to entrap/release cargo (such as proteins) generally involve the use of either amorphous polymer systems or rigid, crystalline constructs like metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Polymer systems can display dynamic properties by expanding and contracting. However, due to its intrinsically amorphous network, polymeric materials may suffer from unintentional passive leaching of the cargo, difficulty in controlled release, and maintaining structural integrity. On the other end of the spectrum, MOFs are examples of rigid materials with defined pore sizes. However, the required molecular interconnectivity thwarts MOFs from being dynamic (i.e., from expanding and contracting on demand or at all). The material\u2019s pore size dictates which biomolecules can be entrapped and limits the type of proteins available. Generally, this method requires passive diffusion of proteins into the material. Another approach involves de novo encapsulation where the protein is included in the MOF precursor mixture. Upon incubation, the MOF forms and the protein are trapped on the inside. However, this limits the types of MOFs available to use, due to the protein requiring compatible conditions \u2013 extreme conditions will denature the protein cargo.\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego have invented a new form of materials, polymer-integrated crystals (PIX), which combine the structural order of protein crystals with the dynamic, stimuli-responsive properties of synthetic polymers.

And, the electrostatic host-guest interactions enable reversible, pH-controlled uptake/release of guest proteins as well as the mutual stabilization of the host and the guest, thus creating a uniquely synergistic platform toward the development of functional biomaterials and the controlled delivery of biological macromolecules\n\nThis approach utilizes PIX, which is a material that seamlessly combines the structural order and periodicity of crystals with the adaptive and tunable mechanical properties of polymeric networks, as a method to capture and release cargo. These materials have several unique properties:  \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01) The crystal\u2019s pore size is not a limitation of what size cargo it can capture because PIX can expand and contract.  \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a02) Furthermore, this allows active/externally controllable/stimuli-responsive capture and release of molecules.  \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a03) The polymeric network in a PIX can be changed/modified with specific functional groups, allowing more selective binding to molecules/proteins of interest.  \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a04) The polymer component can be changed/modified to change the encapsulation/release efficiencies and kinetics.  \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a05) In the first-generation PIX, the protein crystals are composed of human heavy chain ferritin. This is a non-immunogenic protein, which itself can be used for targeting of certain tissues or cancer cells and be used to store cargo in its interior.  \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a06) Ferritin can be easily modified genetically/chemically to alter its interactions with the polymer matrix, thus providing an additional means to change the PIX encapsulation/release efficiencies and kinetics.  \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a07) In addition, PIX can in principle be made using other protein crystals (besides those ferritin), which in turn would allow a) other protein-based functions to be exploited, b) the PIX encapsulation/release properties to be further modulated, and c) further increase the scope of guest/cargo molecules to be encapsulated.",

Pointillism combines this spatial diversity with novel multi-radar fusion algorithms to tackle the problem of specular reflections, sparsity and noise in radar point clouds. Building upon the hardware and algorithms, Pointillism also introduces a novel data-driven approach that enables the detection of multiple dynamic objects in the scene, with their accurate location, orientation and 3D dimensions.

    "published_date": "07/15/2022",
    "ip_description": "High-frequency photoacoustic tomography (> 20 MHz) is becoming increasingly important in biomedical applications. However, it requires data acquisition (DAQ) to have commensurately high sampling rate, which imposes challenges to hardwires and increases the cost of building a PA imaging system. For example, the sampling rate should be higher than 80 MHz to cover 100% bandwidth of a 26-MHz transducer (Nuquist limit). A commercial PA imaging system such as Vevo LAZR X (Fujifilm VISUALSONICS Inc. ON, Canada) with 80-MHz sampling rate can cost more than 990,000$ in the United States.  Many PA groups use clinical ultrasound DAQs, which are low cost but also have a low sampling rate, e.g., the iu22 system\u2019s sampling rate is 32 MHz.\n\nTo solve this issue, researchers from UC San Diego developed a method that can be used for more high-frequency PA applications when the sampling rate of an ultrasound DAQ is insufficient. The researchers developed a method using interleavesampled photoacoustic (PA) imaging for high-frequency imaging with a low sampling rate. This interleaved sampling method relies on adjusting the laser delay, which can be applied to any PA DAQ systems. This approach will allow more ultrasound DAQs, especially clinical DAQs, to be used for high-frequency PA imaging.  \n\nThis technology provides a more cost-effective tool for researchers. Results from both phantom and in vivo experiments with a 30-MHz transducer show that interleaved sampling at 41.67 MHz provides much better imaging quality than the original 41.67-MHz single sampling rate.\n\nThis method harnesses two acquisitions at a low sampling rate to effectively double the sampling rate which consequently reduces the frame rate by a factor of two. It modulates the delay of the light pulses and can thus be applied to any PA DAQ system. We perform both phantom and in vivo studies with a 30-MHz transducer. The results demonstrate that interleaved sampling at 41.67 MHz can capture high frequency information above 30 MHz but a conventional 41.67-MHz sampling rate cannot. The axial and lateral resolution are as high as 63 \u00b5m and 91 \u00b5m via interleaved sampling which are much higher than those of conventional 41.67-MHz sampling (130 \u00b5m and 136 \u00b5m).\n\nApplications include biomedical imaging and data acquisition.",

Mapping spatial distribution and examining metabolic dynamics of different lipids in cells and tissues in situ are critical for understanding aging and diseases.

    "ip_description": "Unlike traditionally-mapped Raman imaging, stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging achieved the capability of imaging metabolic dynamics and a greatly improved signal-noise-ratio. However, its spatial resolution is still limited by the numerical aperture or scattering cross-section.\n\nTo achieve super-resolved SRS imaging, researchers at UC San Diego developed a new deconvolution algorithm \u2013 Adam optimization-based Pointillism Deconvolution (A-PoD) \u2013 for SRS imaging, and demonstrated a spatial resolution of 52 nm on polystyrene beads. By changing the genetic algorithm to A-PoD, the image deconvolution process was shortened by more than 3 orders of magnitude, from a few hours to a few seconds. By applying A-PoD to spatially correlated multi-photon fluorescence (MPF) imaging and deuterium oxide (D2O)-probed SRS (DO-SRS) imaging data from diverse samples, they compared nanoscopic distributions of proteins and lipids in cells and subcellular organelles. The researchers successfully differentiated newly synthesized lipids in lipid droplets using A-PoD coupled with DO-SRS. The A-PoD-enhanced DO-SRS imaging method was also applied to reveal the metabolic change in brain samples from Drosophila on different diets. This new approach allows researchers to quantitatively measure the nanoscopic co-localization of biomolecules and metabolic dynamics in organelles. This A-PoD algorithm may have a wide range of applications, from nano-scale measurements of biomolecules to processing astronomical images.\n\nTo significantly enhance the data processing speed and precision of SUPPOSe, they developed a deconvolution method, named A-PoD (Adam-based Pointillism Deconvolution), that uses Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) solver instead of a genetic algorithm for optimization process. The gradient descent algorithm, Adam, removes the randomness in the genetic algorithm and enables them to enhance the spatial precision and shorten the data processing time. The researchers applied A-PoD to SRS imaging, and generated a series of super-resolved images of mammalian cells and tissues, as well as Drosophila brain tissues. These images displayed nanoscopic distributions of protein and lipid in biological samples. They further measured the shapes and sizes of individual lipid droplets (LDs) in Drosophila brain samples and examined the effects of high glucose diet on brain lipid metabolism and the size distribution of LDs. Our A-PoD algorithm achieves super-resolution images with higher spatial precision than existing deconvolution methods and at a markedly enhanced speed for image processing.",

    "ip_description": "A major bottleneck in nanocarrier and macromolecule development for therapeutic delivery is our limited understanding of the processes involved in their uptake into target cells. This includes their active interactions with membrane transporters that co-ordinate cellular uptake and processing. Current strategies to elucidate the mechanism of uptake, such as painstaking manipulation of individual effectors with pharmacological inhibitors or specific genetic knockdowns, are limited in scope and biased towards previously studied pathways or the intuition of the investigators. Furthermore, each of these approaches present significant off-target effects, clouding the outcomes.\n\nMethods for intracellular transport of nucleic acids are much sought after in the context of both in vitro delivery reagents and in vivo therapeutics. Recently, we found that micellar assemblies of hundreds of amphiphiles consisting of single-stranded DNA which has been covalently linked to a hydrophobic polymer, referred to as DNA-polymer amphiphile nanoparticles or DPANPs, can readily access the cytosol of cells where they modulate mRNA expression of target genomes without transfection or other helper reagents, making them potential therapeutic nucleic acid carriers. However, despite their effective uptake properties and efficacy in the cytosol, it was unknown how these polyanionic structures can enter cells. Indeed, generally, bottlenecks in understanding and achieving delivery and uptake remain a forefront issue in translatability of macromolecular and nanomaterials-based therapeutics generally, including with respect to nucleic acid therapies.\n\nThe nature of pooled screening requires amplifying a single ~200nt region per cell, leading to screens that require amplification from tens-to hundreds of micrograms of genomic DNA. Inhibitory effects of high DNA concentration per PCR have led to a variety of solutions, ranging from simply pooling hundreds of PCR reactions to utilizing restriction enzyme sites present in the lentiviral backbone constant regions flanking the sgRNA to perform DNA gel electrophoresis and size selection to remove undesired gDNA. However, these approaches can be both expensive and have significant handling challenges when scaled to large screens.\n\nTo address this challenge, researchers from UC San Diego developed a pulldown-based approach utilizing biotinylated RNA oligonucleotides complementary to the backbone constant regions flanking the sgRNA site. The researchers developed a simple, low-cost approach for targeted amplification of CRISPR/Cas9 and other pooled screens using biotin-coupled RNA oligonucleotides that shows near-complete recovery of desired sgRNA target regions while removing unwanted genomic DNA background, allowing low-amplification library preparation at scale and with decreased technical variability. The development of this approach enabled the researchers to perform a genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screen to discover modulators of DPANP uptake in HEK293T cells. Confirming the value of this unbiased approach to the study of material transport, they identified a solute carrier protein transporter (SLC18B1) as a novel effector of DPANP uptake. Thus, the use of pooled screening approaches can provide novel insights into as yet uncharacterized mechanisms of transport of therapeutically relevant materials and molecules, creating unique opportunities for future therapeutic development.",

    "ip_description": "UC San Diego researchers have identified a binding interaction between N-6 Methyladenosine RNA Binding Protein 2 (YTHDF2) protein and Serine Protease 23 (PRSS23) transcript where YTHDF2 binds to m6A modified sites on the 3\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) of Prss23. YTHDF2 selectively binds m6A modified sites on RNA and localizes target transcripts to mRNA decay sites for degradation by the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. We have shown in particular that abolishing this interaction triggers apoptosis in Myc-dependent breast cancer cells. Specifically, the lethality of YTHDF2 knockout was identified by RBP CRISPR/Cas9 screening in isogenic Myc-inducible human mammary epithelial cells and the binding interaction with Prss23 was identified by overlapping YTHDF2 eCLIP-seq, m6A-seq, and RNA-seq datasets in several human Myc-dependent breast cancer cell lines.\n\nTherapeutic for Myc-dependent cancer.\n\nThe role of RBPs in MYC-driven breast cancer was investigated by using an RBP-specific CRISPR-Cas9 screen. The screen yielded 57 cancer-supportive RBPs, that mostly had roles in mRNA stability and translation, of which at least 40 had not previously been implicated in the MYC pathway. As MYC overexpression in HMECs is used as an experimental model system, Einstein et\u00a0al. importantly extended the validity of their findings by\u00a0cross-referencing with The Cancer Genome Atlas where, remarkably, 67% of their candidates were found to be highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). YTHDF2 was among a small group of RBPs for which, in addition, decreased expression correlated with patient survival, highlighting that targeting this protein could provide new therapeutic avenues.\n\nUC researchers have confirmed that shRNA-mediated depletion of YTHDF2 causes apoptosis in Myc-dependent cancer cells and we have achieved rescue of the apoptotic phenotype by depleting both YTHDF2 and PRSS23, showing that ablation of newly synthesized PRSS23 protein is sufficient for restoring normal levels of translation initiation by western blot and cell proliferation by time-laspe imaging.",

Elucidating membrane proteins\u2019 diverse structures and biophysical mechanisms is increasingly necessary due to their growing prevalence as a therapeutic target and sheer ubiquity in cells. Most biophysical characterization strategies of transmembrane proteins rely on the tedious overexpression and isolation of recombinant proteins and their reconstitution in model phospholipid bilayers.  \n  \nUnfortunately, membrane protein reconstitution depends on the use of denaturing and unnatural detergents that can interfere with protein structure and function. We have developed a detergent\u2010free method to reconstitute transmembrane proteins in model phospholipid vesicles and GUVs. Additionally, transmembrane proteins are difficult to express in cells due to the extreme insolubility of their transmembrane domain. By incorporating a synthetic transmembrane peptide into liposomes and simply expressing soluble portions of transmembrane proteins in cells, we can use this semisynthetic ligation strategy to more easily construct functional transmembrane proteins and reconstitute them into liposomes for biophysical and biochemical studies.  \n  \nInteins can be found contiguously or non contiguously within some proteins. Non\u2010contiguous inteins are called \u201csplit inteins\u201d. Inteins can be thought of as a type of protein intron which splices itself out of proteins. When non\u2010contiguous inteins find and bind to each other, they are then able to excise themselves resulting in the ligation of their respective exteins. Split intein pairs (C\u2010intein and N\u2010intein) can be attached to proteins of interest in synthetic and cellular systems to ligate protein sequences together.\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego have developed a novel method for the semisynthesis of transmembrane proteins in lipid membranes. This method will improve biochemical, biophysical, and pharmacological research on TM proteins as it will expedite the production of reconstituted proteins anchored by synthetic or native TM domains in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs).\n\nBy utilizing split intein ligations, they were able to semisynthesize single pass transmembrane proteins on liposomes and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). By covalently linking a glycosylated mammalian protein to a TM domain anchored in the phospholipid membrane while retaining its extracellular binding functions, they have created a reconstitution system for cell biologists to model extracellular interactions.\n\nSplit inteins are natural or engineered protein trans\u2010splicing domains. By leveraging the biorthogonality and chemoselectivity of split inteins, overexpressed soluble domains are ligated to synthetic transmembrane peptides to build semisynthetic membrane proteins directly on phospholipid vesicles. This one\u2010pot method bypasses the painstaking expression of recombinantly expressed integral membrane proteins and the multistep process of detergent\u2010based protein reconstitution, making it easier to study these important biomolecules in an isolated system.  \nIn this invention, a synthetic transmembrane (TM) peptide, of a natural or unnatural sequence, fused to a C\u2010intein construct is synthesized via solid phase peptide synthesis. A soluble protein or soluble domain of a transmembrane protein is expressed in cells as a recombinant protein\u2010N\u2010intein fusion. The TM peptide is incorporated into liposomes by making a phospholipid (DOPC) + TM peptide film and hydrating it in water or buffer. Multilamellar vesicles with incorporated TM peptide are made via simple hydration while GUVs with incorporated TM peptide are made via electroformation. The soluble protein\u2010intein fusion is added to the peptide\u2010loaded vesicles and the ligation reaction proceeds on the phospholipid membrane: split intein association results in an N to S acyl shift. A transthioesterification results in the formation of the branched intermediate. Succinimide formation releases both inteins and a final S to N acyl shift results in the ligated extein product (in this invention, a transmembrane peptide fused with soluble proteins or protein domains) with a native peptide bond. Subsequent SDS\u2010PAGE, microscopy, and mass spectra of the product verifies that the reaction has taken place.\n\nExpression and reconstitution of functional membrane proteins. High throughput drug screening of transmembrane (TM) proteins in model membranes. This method will improve biochemical, biophysical, and pharmacological research on TM proteins as it will expedite the production of reconstituted proteins anchored by synthetic or native TM domains in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs).",

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego have generated a technology that can sequester RNA binding proteins (RBP) and inhibit their activity in cells. The technology is a single-strand of RNA containing high or low affinity binding site(s) for an RBP of interest. The purpose of the binding site is to recruit an RBP in vivo and sequester it from its normal RNA targets thereby preventing its interaction with endogenous RNA targets.  \n  \nThe RNA also contains a 5\u2019 SCNMV Exo Element and a 3\u2019 MALAT1 pseudoknot to protect both ends of the transcript from degradation by nucleases. This property allows the RNA to be completely stable and can be allowed to accumulate to high concentration when expressed from a DNA expression vector. Alternatively, this RNA can be transcribed ex vivo and be delivered to cells by means of transfection reagent.\n\n### Applications\n\nResearch tool. Control\u200b RBP activity.\n\nTherapeutic for diseases.\u200b Technology can be delivered to and expressed in cells using viral adeno-associated vectors (AAV) or be delivered to cells as a synthetic strand of RNA.\n\n### Advantages\n\nThe only comparable technology that can achieve similar specificity for RBPs is circular RNAs.

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego have developed ULoc, a scalable, low-power, and cm-accurate UWB localization and tracking system in the form of a VR headset tracking, that provides real-time accurate 3D indoor localization.\nA myriad of IoT applications, ranging from tracking assets in hospitals, logistics, and construction industries to indoor tracking in large indoor spaces, demand centimeter-accurate localization that is robust to blockages from hands, furniture, or other occlusions in the environment. With this need, in the recent past, Ultra Wide Band (UWB) based localization and tracking has become popular. Its popularity is driven by its proposed high bandwidth and protocol specifically designed for localization of specialized \"tags\". This high bandwidth of UWB provides a fine resolution of the time-of-travel of the signal that can be translated to the location of the tag with centimeter-grade accuracy in a controlled environment. Unfortunately, we find that high latency and high-power consumption of these time-of-travel methods are the major culprits which prevent such a system from deploying multiple tags in the environment.\nSince UWB has been developed as localization specific protocol, there has been a need for infrastructure based, low-power and real-time indoor localization while providing cm-Accurate 3D UWB tag locations. The UCSD researchers have solved these limitations by novel hardware, firmware and algorithm designs.\nResearchers from UC San Diego have developed ULoc, a scalable, low-power, and cm-accurate UWB localization and tracking system in the form of a VR headset tracking, that provides real-time accurate 3D indoor localization. In ULoc, the researchers built a custom multi-antenna UWB anchor that enables azimuth and polar angle of arrival (henceforth shortened to '3D-AoA') measurements, with just the reception of a single packet from the tag. By combining multiple UWB anchors, ULoc can localize the tag in 3D space. The single-packet location estimation reduces the latency of the entire system by at least 3\u00d7, as compared with state of art multi-packet UWB localization protocols, making UWB based localization scalable. ULoc's design also reduces the power consumption per location estimate at the tag by 9\u00d7, as compared to state-of-art time-of-travel algorithms. We further develop a novel 3D-AoA based 3D localization that shows a stationary localization accuracy of 3.6 cm which is 1.8\u00d7 better than the state-of-the-art two-way ranging (TWR) systems. We further developed a temporal tracking system that achieves a tracking accuracy of 10 cm in mobile conditions which is 4.3\u00d7 better than the state-of-the-art TWR systems.",

    "ip_description": "Power amplifier performance for emerging 5G mm-wave systems poses significant challenges for output power, efficiency and linearity. Efficiency in backoff is a key concern, given the peak-to-average power ratio of order 6-9dB for 5G signals. As a result, considerable attention has been given to composite amplifiers featuring backoff efficiency enhancement, particularly Doherty amplifiers.\n\nAdaptive bias circuits have been previously developed for use with power amplifiers at low microwave frequencies (for example, 1-2GHz as applied in 2G, 3G and 4G cellular networks).\u00a0Direct application of these techniques is not straightforward at higher frequencies, such as 28GHz as used for 5G wireless communications, because the transistors have less gain at the high frequencies.\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego have designed a family of adaptive bias circuits that are straightforward to incorporate in the amplifier, and do not load down the input and decrease the amplifier gain. The adaptive bias circuits\u00a0boost gate bias voltage when the input power gets to be high. This power applifier technology provides state-of-the-art back-off efficiency for silicon Ka-band Doherty PAs using single inputs and without digital predistortion, while providing high gain and output power.\n\nThe adaptive bias circuits are of major interest for mm-wave transmitters employing antenna arrays and using modulated output signals that require high linearity.\u00a0In such systems, it is generally not cost effective to provide digital predistortion capability for each power amplifier \u2013 thus the power amplifier must be linear on its own.\u00a0The linearity improvement provided with the adaptive bias circuits described here is a significant benefit.\u00a0It allows operation without the large backoff power levels needed with conventional amplifiers while still maintaining required system linearity, and thus can provide higher power and efficiency for the system.\u00a0Systems that can directly benefit are 5G wireless communication systems, satellite communication systems, several military communication systems and advanced radar systems that use complex modulations.\n\nThe gain flatness near the maximum output power is improved (thus overcoming the \u201csoft saturation\u201d effect that shows up in many CMOS PAs).\u00a0The phase of the output can also be kept more constant at high power by using these techniques with representative FETs and amplifier configurations.\u00a0An additional important benefit for mm-wave CMOS power amplifiers is that the adjustment in gate bias reduces that maximum drain to gate voltage experienced by the controlled transistor and as a result decreases the degradation process of time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) that is an important limiter to the performance of mm-wave CMOS PAs. Adjustment of the reference dc voltage of the adaptive bias circuit can alter the gain and phase profiles that become degraded when the output load deviates from 50 ohms.\u00a0\u00a0Multiple adaptive bias circuits can be used for the different transistors of compound amplifiers.\u00a0For example, in a Doherty amplifier, there are transistors (often several of them) in the main path and in the auxiliary path.\u00a0The overall linearity of the Doherty amplifier can be adjusted with the use of multiple adaptive bias circuits controlling the transistor biases.  \n\nCircuit features include: 1) advanced output combiner design that achieves lower losses than conventional impedance inverter implementation; 2) adaptive biasing for linearization and backoff efficiency enhancement; 3) use of pMOS rather than nMOS to provide the potential for superior reliability; 4) compact input power splitter.  \n\nThis PA provides state-of-the-art back-off efficiency for silicon Ka-band Doherty PAs using single inputs and without digital predistortion, while providing high gain and output power.\n\nIn the cited paper below (Alluri et al. 2021), a Ka band Doherty amplifier is reported which achieves a combination of high power (23dBm Psat), high efficiency in backoff (29% at 6dB backoff, 24% at 8 dB backoff), high gain (16dB, stemming from a 2 stage design) and high linearity (enhanced by adaptive bias circuit linearizers) at 26 GHz in 45nm CMOS-SOI technology.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego have harnessed the rich information content of the local neural potentials recorded from brain surface to infer the cortex-wide brain activity. By using electrocorticography signals recorded from a small region on the brain surface, the inventors are able to computationally construct brain potentials across whole brain. This invention may allow large area mapping of neural dysfunctions and neurological disorders without requiring extremely invasive neural surgeries. Virtual implants will use data from clinical ECoG recordings on brain surface that are routinely performed in patients before brain surgeries and compute the brain potentials across the whole cortex. Neural circuit dysfunctions are the cause of most neurological diseases, including epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, dystonia, depression and schizophrenia. For example, when applied to epilepsy, virtual implants will precisely determine the exact coordinates of the neuronal population generating seizures, unlike conventional local recordings resulting in low success rate (50%) for epilepsy surgeries. That will greatly impact the outcome and success rate of brain surgeries. Furthermore, brain\u2010computer interfaces (BCI) have shown great promise for tetraplegia (paralysis), but penetrating microelectrodes cause extensive tissue damage limiting decoding ability and the lifetime of prosthetics less than a year. Virtual implants will enable less invasive long\u2010term BCI by enabling decoding of spike activity from surface ECoG arrays. Virtual Implants will lead us to new findings on neural dynamics that is unattainable otherwise and facilitate development of targeted treatments for neurological disorders affecting one billion people worldwide. Inventors have demonstrated the possibility of inferring cortex\u2010wide activity from locally recorded ECoG signals. The research team implanted transparent graphene microelectrode arrays over the mouse somatosensory cortex and performed simultaneous ECoG recordings and wide\u2010field calcium imaging of the dorsal cortex in awake, head\u2010fixed mice. By developing a recurrent neural network model using locally recorded ECoG signals as inputs, we successfully demonstrated virtual imaging of the averaged spontaneous activity from multiple cortical areas and the cortex\u2010wide activity with pixel\u2010level spatial resolution. Please see the citation below for the published paper, in which the researchers designed a neural network model to show that both the mean activity of different cortical regions and the pixel-level cortex-wide neural activity can be decoded using locally recorded surface potentials. These findings demonstrated that the locally recorded neural potentials indeed contain rich information for large-scale neural activity and the surface potential responses in different frequency bands and different recording channels provide distinct information about the large-scale neural activity.",

All known transistor technologies are intrinsically non-linear. This non-linearity leads to signal distortion and power loss. Non-linearity is embodied in a decrease of the transistor current gain cut-off frequency, fT, and maximum oscillation frequency, fmax, with an increase in the drain current.  \nIn contrast, the patented technology here is one of a new Fin MOS-HEMT device permits flexible engineering of the device threshold voltage in order to attain linearity over a wider VGS range (voltage between transistor gate and source (VGS) in excess of the threshold voltage (Vt) where Vt is defined as the minimum). \n\nEngineers from UC San Diego have patented a device architecture with potential for intrinsically tunable ultra-wide band linearity.

    "ip_description": "Contact force is a natural way for humans to interact with the physical world around us. However, most of our interactions with the digital world are largely based on a simple binary sense of touch (contact or no contact). Similarly, when interacting with robots to perform complex tasks, such as surgery, we need to acquire the rich force information and contact location, to aid in the task. To address these issues, researchers at UC San Diego have developed WiForce, which is a \u2018wireless\u2019 sensor that can be attached to an object or robot, like a sticker. WiForce\u2019s sensor transduces force magnitude and location into phase changes of an incident RF signal, which is reflected back to enable measurement of force and contact location. WiForce\u2019s sensor is designed to support wide-band frequencies all the way up to 3 GHz. The inventors evaluated the force sensing wirelessly in different environments, including in-body like, and achieve force accuracy of 0.3 N and contact location accuracy of 0.6 mm.  \n  The invention creates a new sensing modality to sense contact force and it's location of application, and communicate these wirelessly with ultra low power requirements  \n  The uniqueness in this work lies in the extreme low power requirements for the sensing modalities, which allows the sensor to be powered via RF energy harvestors, and thus allows the sensor to be 'batteryless', a very big requirement for the force sensing applications to surgical robots  \n  The invention essentially works by transducing contact force information into wireless signal phase changes, which are read by a wireless reader. To achieve this, the reader first transmits a wideband RF signal which the sensor backscatters with phase changes, and the reader receives back the phase changed signal. The phase change is then read at multiple frequencies using the wideband capabilities of the reader for a very robust phase change detection.\n\nSurgical Robots. Many robots are remotely teleoperated, typically due to the need to operate in environments that are either hazardous or physically difficult for humans to access. Force sensing in these scenarios is critical, since teleoperation through a remote interface or tool causes the operator to lose their sense of touch, as they are no longer in direct contact with the physical environment. This lack of touch presents a particular challenge in the surgical setting, where robots can offer a number of potential benefits due to increased dexterity and precision compared to manual tools. In addition, the sensing challenge is further exacerbated by the small size of surgical tools, as well as the need for force information not just at the tool tip, but ideally along the length of the tool as well. This exacerbates the need for force sensing from not only requiring the location and magnitude of force, but the sensors should also be easy to attach, easy to read \u2013 no wires, low-form factor and batteryless.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego introduce RNA-CLAMP, a technology which enables site-specific and enzymatic cross-linking (clamping) of two selected stem loops within an RNA of interest. Intramolecular clamping of the RNA can disrupt normal RNA function, whereas subsequent photo-cleavage of the crosslinker restores activity. We applied the RNA-CLAMP technique to the single guide RNA of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system. By clamping two stem loops of the single-guide RNA (sgRNA) with a photo-cleavable cross-linker, gene editing was completely silenced. Visible light irradiation cleaved the crosslinker and restored gene editing with high spatiotemporal resolution. Furthermore, by designing two photo-cleavable linkers which are responsive to different wavelength of lights, we achieved multiplexed photo-activation of gene editing in mammalian cells. Notably, although the Cas9-sgRNA RNP is not capable of DNA cleavage activity upon clamping, it maintained the capability to bind to the target DNA. The RNA-CLAMP enabled photo-activated CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing platform offers clean background, free choice of activation wavelength and multiplexing capability.\n\nRNA is one of the most important biomacromolecules in the living systems, manipulating a highly complex collection of functions which are critical to the regulation of numerous cellular pathways and processes. Being the cornerstone of biology\u2019s central dogma, numerous approached has been developed to study and manipulate the functions of RNAs. However, compared to the study of proteins and DNAs/chromosomes, our understanding of RNA\u2019s cellular function is significantly lacking. This is partially because of the transient nature of RNA molecule.The half-life of RNA is significantly shorter than DNA and protein. Besides, the detection of RNA suffers from low copy number as low as one copy per cell. Many creative methodologies have been developed in the past few decades to address this challenging question: how to label and manipulate cellular RNAs. Apart from non-covalent approaches, covalent RNA-modifying approaches have been challenging because of the difficulties in selectively modifying a single RNA of interest among the other RNAs in cellular conditions. Comparing to non-covalent interactions, covalent strategies provide an additional level of robustness in harsh cellular conditions.\n\nDue to the covalent linkage, the conjugated functional groups will not be disassociated from the RNA of interest in most conditions. Besides, the low-molecular weight of small-molecule (< 2 kDa) minimize the perturbation of normal RNA functions. While many covalent RNA-modifying approaches have been developed, few methods allow for the selective labeling of a single post-transcriptional RNA among the complex cellular RNA pool.\n\nGene Editing\n\n*   This technology permits precise and rapid control of gene editing and will serve as a versatile tool in the future development of stimuli responsive gene editing technologies.\n*   Beyond gene editing, RNA-CLAMP provides a site-specific tool for manipulating the internal structure of functional RNAs\n\nAdvantages\n\n*   Optical control of gene editing in mammalian cells with high spatiotemporal resolution and multiplexing capability. The optical control of CRISPR-Cas9 offers non-invasive manipulation of gene editing with excellent spatiotemporal resolution.\n*   Minimized cellular toxicity. By controlling the irradiation time period and light intensity, cellular toxicity can be minimized.\n*   Multiplexed activation of editing. Moreover, different wavelength of lights might be used to trigger gene editing at multiple genomic loci, enabling multiplexed activation of gene editing.",

    "ip_description": "Cardiac MRI is the clinical reference standard for visual and quantitative assessment of heart function. Specifically, cine balanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) can yield cardiac images with high myocardium\u2013blood pool contrast for evaluation of left ventricular (LV) function. However, MRI suffers from long acquisition times, often requiring averaging across multiple heartbeats, and necessitates a trade-off among spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and scan time. Clinically, radiologists are forced to balance acquisition time with resolution to fit clinical needs, and certain applications such as real-time imaging may require small acquisition matrices. Image scaling is typically performed by using conventional upscaling methods, such as Fourier domain zero padding and bicubic interpolation. These methods, however, do not readily recover spatial detail, such as the myocardium\u2013blood pool interface or delineation of papillary muscles.\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego have shown that convolutional neural network (CNNs) can recover high-frequency spatial detail from low-resolution MRI scans. Each of the CNNs they evaluated (SRNet and Unet) outperformed traditional zero padding and bicubic image upscaling strategies. This patent-pending technology shows the feasibility of super-resolution methods to improve the speed of MRI acquisition. In particular, for cardiac MRI, it is often challenging to acquire high-quality images in patients with arrhythmia. A real-time strategy that combines multiple techniques including CNN super-resolution might make this more feasible.\n\nAccelerating MRI acquisition, improving spatial detail in CT.\n\nDeep learning image super resolution can consistently outperform conventional image upscaling methods and can infer high-frequency spatial detail from low-resolution inputs.\n\nWhen trained with Fourier downsampled data, deep learning consistently outperformed Fourier domain zero padding and bicubic interpolation at upsampling factors of two to 64.  \n\nTrained purely in image space, both single-frame and multiframe super-resolution convolutional neural networks (CNNs) showed filling of outer k-space, indicating CNN inference of high-frequency spatial detail.\n\nSuper-resolution of small-matrix acquisitions from 10 patients yielded ventricular volumes comparable to measurements from full-resolution images with improved image detail.\n\nImages demonstrate proof-of-concept assessment of super-resolution methods. Low-resolution input, full-resolution reference, and k-UNet super-resolved images are shown for five experiments: A, short-axis cine steady-state free precession (SSFP) in a 27-year-old healthy male volunteer at 3.0 T, B, four-chamber cine SSFP in a 26-year-old healthy male volunteer at 3.0 T, C, short-axis cine SSFP in a 36-year-old patient with transposition of the great arteries after Mustard switch, D, four-chamber cine SSFP in the same patient as in, C, and, E, photographs of a human face. The k-UNet network appears to improve myocardium\u2013blood pool delineation, especially along the septal wall. Although trained only with short-axis images, the k-UNet network appears to generalize to long-axis images and digital photographs, sharpening details. This network also appears to further enhance detail of low-resolution images and full-resolution reference acquisitions.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego have invented a platform that can map indoor environments and collect location labeled Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI). Dubbed \u2018MapFind\u2019 this technology enables easy deployments of indoor positioning systems by automatically constructing maps of the environment and by enabling quick testing of localization algorithms. The inventors demonstrated the efficacy of this platform by collecting 150,000 data points in a 1000 square feet space, and leveraged this labeled data to train a deep learning based WiFi localization model, \u2018DeepLoc\u2019, that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Wi-Fi positioning by a factor of 2.\n\nMapFind may open up opportunities for other researchers to create large labeled datasets for indoor positioning and allow for novel machine learning based approaches to localization. Furthermore, the inventors envision that the datasets thus collected will slowly evolve into a standardized repository that will enable standardized evaluation of new localization algorithms.\n\nExisting art misses the link between the context based maps and the WiFi localization. Our invention bridges this gap. The current state of the art indoor localization algorithms are limited to testing across few 100s of data points and thus disabling them from the vast knowledge of Deep Learning models. While our invention enables the collection of millions of data points automatically, thus enabling us to develop Deep Learning based indoor WiFi localization models.\n\nThe system operates in two stages: mapping and localization. During the mapping phase, MapFind robot, equipped with a Wi-Fi device to collect wireless channel information, performs an autonomous walk through the space to map the environment. Simultaneously, the Wi-Fi device on MapFind collects the CSI for Wi-Fi packets heard from all the access points in the environment. At the end of its walk, the platform generates a map of the environment, and a log of the CSI-data collected at different locations. The CSI-data is labeled with the ground truth values of the platform locations.\n\nDeepLoc uses the CSI-log generated by MapFind to train a deep learning model. This model, once trained, can be used by users to locate themselves using their Wi-Fi enabled devices (like smartphones). The users can also access the maps of the building by making calls to a centralized server.\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego have for the first time, established the accuracy requirements for the location attributes of access points (AP) to achieve decimeter level user localization accuracy. Surprisingly, these requirements for antenna geometries and deployment orientation are very stringent, which is hard to achieve with manual effort. To ease the deployment of real-world WiFi localization, the researchers developed LocAP, which is an autonomous system to physically map the environment and accurately LOCate the attributes of existing wireless infrastructure in the physical space down to the required stringent accuracy of 3 mm antenna separation and 3 degree deployment orientation median errors, whereas state-of-the-art algorithm reports 150 mm and 25 degrees respectively.\n\nUsing the mapping and reverse localization information, this invention can provide accurate indoor localization and navigation for large indoor environments. These accurate access points (AP) location attributes aids many of the networking issues like user location based smart hand-off, network load balancing utilizing both AP locations and client locations and other networking services based on AP and client locations. Further, with the emergence of 5G and 11ad/ax wireless protocols, where directional beams become more and more important, these angle of arrival estimates that are provided by LocAP, can be further used to perform smart-beamforming at both the client and the AP side.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego invented a method to measure relative differences in 4He mole fraction (4He/M) between two large samples of air using a custom mass spectrometer inlet system. Novel elements of this invention include continuous-flow removal of reactive gases via titanium gettering immediately upstream of the mass spectrometer inlet and the use of an actively controlled open split for balancing pressures upstream of a shared capillary directed towards the mass spectrometer. Gas handling techniques, the inlet system and the continuous-flow getter oven are described in detail in a pending patent application.\n\nSample and standard gas are delivered from compressible volumes comprising metal bellows. Pressure in each bellows can be adjusted by compressing the bellows using a motor system. The pressures are typically adjusted to yield equal beam strengths for sample and standard. This is important because the ratio of the beam currents of two or more isotopes typically varies with the beam strength, even for a constant isotopic mixture. Over the course of an analysis, the bellows empty gradually while the motor position is fixed. Thus, the gas pressure changes, leading to apparent changes in the isotopic ratio, and these changes are not necessarily equal for sample and reference, leading to apparent changes in the difference in isotopic ratio between sample and reference over time. These changes need to be corrected for based on extensive prior calibrations, which adds complexity and reduces the integrity of the results.\n\nThis invention resolves the problem of signal\u2010pressure dependence by actively stabilizing the pressure in the bellows by progressively compressing the bellows during the analysis to offset the impact of gas loss.\n\nThis is a clear improvement over the existing bellow system, which eliminates issues of signal pressure dependence that current generation dual inlet systems struggle with. This invention provides an improved inlet system that will improve performance. Crucially, the inherent nonlinearity of mass spectrometers imposes bias and error, and this invention bypasses this issue by keeping the gas pressure in the mass spectrometer constant over time. This provides a substantial improvement in measurement precision.\n\nThis invention also extends the capabilities of existing mass spectrometers allowing precise measurements of relative changes in the mole fraction of gases without additional work.\n\nSuitable for other noble gases ( He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe and Rn ) applications.\n\nOne application allows for the precise measurement of Helium in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThis invention a new method for high-precision measurements of changes in the 4He mole fraction of atmospheric air, which can be directly related to changes in He/N2 ratio. The method relies on monitoring of the 4He+ ion beam in a mass spectrometer during sample\u2013standard switching. The ion beam is stabilized by flowing sample and standard air through a single capillary into the MS from an actively pressure controlled open split such that variability of the 4He+ ion beam directly reflects differences in the helium mole fraction of the gas mixtures. Measurements of the helium mole fraction can easily be converted to \u03b4(He/N2) if O2/N2, Ar/N2 and CO2 concentrations of the sample are determined as well.",

    "published_date": "12/02/2020",
    "ip_description": "Bioorthogonal ligations encompass coupling chemistries that have considerable utility in living systems. Among the numerous bioorthogonal chemistries described to date, cycloaddition reactions between tetrazines and strained dienophiles are widely used in proteome, lipid, and glycan labeling due to their extremely rapid kinetics. In addition, a variety of functional groups can be released after the cycloaddition reaction, and drug delivery triggered by in vivo tetrazine ligation is in human phase I clinical trials.  \n\nWhile applications of tetrazine ligations are growing in academia and industry, it has so far not been possible to control this chemistry to achieve the high degrees of spatial and temporal precision necessary for modifying mammalian cells with single-cell resolution.\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego have now demonstrated visible light-activated formation of tetrazines from photocaged dihydrotetrazines, which enables live-cell spatiotemporal control of rapid biorthogonal cycloaddition reactions between tetrazines and dienophiles such as trans-cyclooctenes (TCOs). Photocaged dihydrotetrazines are stable in conditions that normally degrade tetrazines, enabling efficient early-stage incorporation of bioorthogonal handles into biomolecules such as peptides. Photocaged dihydrotetrazines allow the use of non-toxic visible light to trigger tetrazine ligations on live mammalian cells. By tagging reactive phospholipids with fluorophores, the researchers demonstrate modification of HeLa cell membranes with single-cell spatial resolution.\n\nIn the cited publication, the inventors demonstrated a methodology for the photoactivation of tetrazines that enables biomolecular labeling, spatiotemporal modification of live-cell membranes with single-cell precision, and photopharmacology (and precision drug delivery) when combined with \u201cclick to release\u201d strategies.\n\nTetrazine instability is a well-recognized obstacle to their use, and the inventors have found that photocaged tetrazine precursors are highly stable, even in the presence of strong bases which rapidly degrade tetrazines. Given the stability of photocaged dihydrotetrazines, this invention is expected to find broad application as a general tetrazine protecting group. Photocaged dihydrotetrazines would be especially useful in conditions known to degrade tetrazines, such as those encountered during the installation of 18F radionuclides for PET imaging or for live-cell pulse-chase experiments where tetrazine reactivity would be required to be maintained for an arbitrary amount of time before reaction. Indeed, preliminary results indicate that photocaged dihydrotetrazines, unlike tetrazines, are very stable under the conditions typically used for fluorination. Since this new method directly activates tetrazine precursors, high spatiotemporal precision is achievable. By modifying phospholipids on cell surfaces, the inventors showed that single-cell activation is feasible. The technique could enable monitoring of lipid trafficking and dynamics in live cells by controlling where and when caged tetrazines on lipids are activated and following their transport by post-labeling with dienophile modified fluorophores.  \nLight activated release of the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin was carried out by combining photoactivation of tetrazine formation with \u201cclick to release\u201d strategies. The photocaged tetrazine precursor and light alone showed negligible toxicity, demonstrating the biocompatibility of the technique. Such optically controlled drug release may have practical application in image guided surgery and photodynamic therapy.  \n\nThis invention might be extended to other amine caging functionalities capable of masking dihydrotetrazines, allowing rapid biorthogonal ligation in response to additional stimuli such as enzymatic activity, pH, or the presence of metal complexes.",

However, mmWave links are notorious for low reliability since they suffer from frequent outages due to blockage and user mobility. Traditional mmWave systems are hardly reliable for two reasons. First, they create a highly directional link that acts as a single point of failure and cannot be sustained for high user mobility. Second, they follow a `reactive` approach, which reacts after the link has already suffered an outage.\n\nIn response to this limitation, researchers from UC San Diego have designed mmReliable, a reliable mmWave system that implements smart analog beamforming and user tracking to handle environmental vulnerabilities. It creates custom beam patterns with multiple lobes and optimizes their angle, phase, and amplitude to maximize the signal strength at the receiver. Such phase-coherent multi-beam patterns allow the signal to travel along multiple paths and add up constructively at the receiver to improve throughput. Of course, multi-beam links are resilient to occasional blockages of few beams in multi-beam compared to a single-beam system. With user mobility, mmReliable proactively tracks the motion in the background by leveraging continuous channel estimates without affecting the data rates. We implement mmReliable on a 28 GHz testbed with 400 MHz bandwidth and a 64 element phased-array supporting 5G NR waveforms.\n\nV2X and VR applications\n\nRigorous indoor and outdoor experiments demonstrate that mmReliable achieves close to 100% reliability providing 1.5 times better throughput than traditional single-beam systems.",

Phase-error correction is essential for both quantification of blood flow as well as for visualization.\n\nRadiologists from UC San Diego developed a novel and reliable strategy for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn to identify and estimate a 3D magnetic phase\u2010error map from 4D Flow MRI data. With this strategy, the CNN does not require any input from a human operator or any algorithm to identify static soft tissue. This correction can then be smoothed, to fully correct magnetic phase\u2010error while avoid spurious inaccuracies in the CNN inference. The researchers show that this improves measurement of blood flow with increased consistency and conservation of mass, comparable to what can be achieved with manual phase\u2010error correction.\n\nObviates human, manual correction of magnetic phase\u2010error, which is prone to error.\n\nThe invention automatically corrects background magnetic phase\u2010error (also known as eddy\u2010current related phase\u2010error) in MRI images, which is critical for measurement of blood flow by 4D Flow MRI. This resolves a long\u2010standing issue where human, manual soft tissue selection is currently required to perform this correction. We first illustrate this in abdominopelvic 4D Flow MRI exams, anticipating this will be the hardest to solve, but expect that it will work just as effectively in neurovascular and cardiothoracic and other applications of 4D Flow MRI.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego describe methodologies to fuse RNA modification enzymes to ribosome\u2010associated subunits and proteins such as ribosome subunits at the entry site and ribosome release factors. By doing so our invention enables RNA modifications that can be detected by sequencing methods as a surrogate measure for ribosome initiation, scanning, elongation and release. As a proof\u2010of concept, the inventors fused RPS3 (a protein part of the ribosome subunit) to the APOBEC1 enzyme that deaminates cytidine to uracil (C to U). The research team could quantify translation efficiency by RNA\u2010seq to measure translation in full length transcripts (by long\u2010read sequencing such as nanopore) or in single cells (using single cell RNA\u2010seq in the 10X platform).\n\nAntibody-based methodologies such as CLIP and RIP are staples used to identify RNA-binding sites and targets of RBPs. This new STAMP approach offers several advantages. First, CLIP is generally constrained by input requirements, frequently needing thousands to millions of cells. Here we demonstrate that STAMP can be used reliably at single-cell resolution to identify RNA targets, binding sites and even extract motifs from a few cells to a single cell. STAMP enables the combined identification of RBP binding sites and global measurement of gene expression, a long-standing goal for the gene expression, genomics and RNA communities. Second, CLIP requires fragmentation to separate bound and unbound RNA, but that precludes the discovery of isoform-dependent binding sites on mRNAs that may differ by an exon or translated regions.\n\nEnables translation efficiency for genes to be measured genome\u2010wide with potential for drug screens , characterization in single cells from complex cellular models and evaluation of drugs for safety.\n\n*   STAMP identifies RBP binding sites without immunoprecipitation.\n*   Long-read STAMP reveals isoform-specific binding profiles.\n*   Ribosome-subunit STAMP edits are enriched in highly translated coding sequences and are responsive to mTOR inhibition.\n*   Deconvolution of RBP-specific and cell type\u2013specific RNA binding.\n*   The ability of STAMP to recover RBP\u2013RNA targets in single cells suggests that targets of multiple RBPs can be simultaneously discovered from a single multiplexed experiment.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego have developed the first sparse hyperdimensional (HD) computing method that enables sparsity on the trained HD model. They name the proposed method \"SparseHD\". SparseHD improves the efficiency of hyperdimensional computing through reducing the number of elements in trained classes (which are in the form of hypervectors). This element reduction (i.e., sparsification) is done in two different ways.\n\nIn the first approach, which they call dimension-wise sparsification, SparseHD finds if elements of a specific index of all class/model hypervectors have an equal or close-to-equal value (e.g., dimension 2 of all class hypervectors lies in a limited range). This dimension is then removed from all class hypervectors because during the similarity checking (of an incoming query hypervector with class hypervectors) it adds the same score to all comparisons, so is ineffectual in finding out the maximum similarity score.  \n\nIn the second approach, which they call class-wise sparsification, SparseHD finds the ineffectual dimensions 'within a class'. Essentially it removes the dimensions with values close to zero, because when such dimension is multiplied to the corresponding dimension of an incoming query hypervector, the score will also be close to zero. So such dimensions can be removed without significant impact on the score of a class.  \n\nThe inventors also propose to use an automated technique which iteratively retrains HD models to compensate the potential quality loss that might be incurred by above-mentioned model sparsification. Basically retraining calibrates the values of remaining dimensions to enhance the accuracy.\n\nThey also propose an FPGA implementation of sparse HD computation that supports both the dimension-wise and class-wise sparse models. Their FPGA accelerator is hand-crafted in a pipelined structure to effectively utilize the FPGA resources to maximize performance. Specifically, they implement a Compress-Sparse-Column (CSC) architecture to enable class-wise sparsification as it is more complicated than dimension-wise sparsification that removes a specific dimension of all classes.\n\nThis design enables low-power and efficient machine learning for IoT and embedded devices.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego have developed a Cas directed pseudouridylation technology, largely built upon the existing RCas9 system, which uses a single-guide RNA to provide a simple and rapidly programmable system for modification of specific RNA molecules in live cells. Due to its overall design simplicity as well as its highly encodable nature, this platform promises high utility and versatility when compared to other similar RNA modifying methods.\nMore specifically, the researchers have generated a technology to perform programmable RNA pseudouridylation at single-nucleotide resolution using RNA-targeting CRISPR/Cas: engineered single guide RNA (esgRNA) combinations. This approach provides a means to reversibly alter genetic information in a temporal manner, unlike traditional CRISPR/Cas9 driven genomic engineering which relies on permanently altering DNA sequence.  \nThis invention stems from taking a nuclease-dead version of DNA/RNA-targeting Cas (e.g. Sp/Sau/Cje dCas9  or dCas13a/b/d) and generating recombinant proteins with effector enzymes capable of performing ribonucleotide base modification to alter how sequence of the RNA molecule is recognized by cellular machinery. Specifically, constructs have been made that express RNA-targeting Cas (for example dCas9 or dCas13 fused to the pseudouridylation domain of human DKC1, PUS1, PUS3 or PUS7) using either a short peptide linker or an \u2018XTEN\u2019 linker peptide for spatial separation.  With RNA-targeting Cas as a surrogate RNA-binding motif, researchers may now use esgRNAs to direct pseudouridylation to RNA sites that they wish to modify.  Current systems used to directly pseudouridylate RNA rely on recruitment of endogenous pseudouridylation machinery by exogenously expressed guide RNAs, and have not yet been demonstrated to be effective in mammalian systems.  Because Cas proteins bind with picomolar affinity to guide RNA scaffolds/direct repeat hairpins, and because our system uses dual guide architecture to increase both target affinity and specificity, the UCSD technology can potentially direct RNA pseudouridylation with higher efficiency and specificity, leading to fewer off-target editing events.  \n\nApplications\n\n1) Research tool. Characterize the effects of directed cellular RNA pseudouridylation on RNA processing and cellular dynamics. \n 2) Therapeutic for diseases.  Viral (AAV) or other delivery approaches to treat: premature termination codon/nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) RNA diseases such as Hurler\u2019s syndrome, Cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This also could include diseases associated with deficiencies in RNA pseudouridylation.",

Although ASO therapies have been shown great promise in eliminating pathogenic transcripts or modulating RBP binding, they are synthetic in construction and thus cannot be encoded within DNA. This complicates potential gene therapy strategies, which would rely on regular administration of ASOs throughout the lifetime of the patient. Furthermore, they are incapable of modulating the genetic sequence of RNA.

As the amount of the data keeps increasing, many applications send the data to powerful systems, e.g., data centers, to run the learning algorithms. On the one hand, sending the original data is not desirable due to privacy and security concerns.  On the other hand, many machine learning models may require unencrypted (plaintext) data, e.g., original images, to train models and perform inference. When offloading these computation tasks, sensitive information may be exposed to the untrustworthy cloud system which is susceptible to internal and external attacks. In many IoT systems, the learning procedure should be performed with the data that is held by a large number of user devices at the edge of the Internet. These users may be unwilling to share the original data with the cloud and other users if security concerns cannot be addressed.\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego have addressed the current limitations by developing a new framework, referred to as SecureHD, which can provide a secure learning solution based on the application of high-dimensional (HD) computing. This invention can provide systems, circuits and computer program products providing a framework for secured collaborative training using hyper-dimensional vector based data encoding/decoding and related methods.\n\nIn one example, the original data can be encoded as secure, high-dimensional vectors, which can be used to train a model. Thus, applications can send their data to the cloud in a secured form, while the cloud can perform the offloaded tasks without additional decryption steps. In particular, SecureHD can be used to implement classification methods suitable to handle a large amount of data that the cloud typically processes. In addition, SecureHD can recover the encoded data in a lossless manner. As described herein, the SecureHD framework can perform the encoding and decoding tasks 145.6 times and 6.8 times faster, respectively, than an encryption/decryption library running on in a conventional system. In addition, embodiments according the present invention can provide accuracy of about 95% on average for diverse practical classification tasks including cloud scale datasets.\n\nThis technology (SecureHD framework):\n\n*   Performs the encoding and decoding tasks with high efficiency, e.g., 145.6\u00d7 and 6.8\u00d7 faster than the state-of-the-art encryption/decryption library.\n*   Achieves accuracy of 95% on average for diverse practical learning tasks.\n*   Provides lossless data recovery with 4\u00d7 reduction in the data size compared to the existing encryption solution.",

During the ablation procedure, a cardiac electrophysiologist will thermally ablate, or burn off, defective heart tissue with radiofrequency or cryoablation technology.

Since the left atrial tissue is approximately 2mm thin, the heat can transfer through it to the esophagus in contact and cause thermal damage / lesions on the esophagus.  In worst-case rare scenarios, an atrio-esophageal fistula, or hole between the esophagus and the heart, can occur which has a ~75% mortality rate.

    "ip_description": "It has been shown that intensive BP lowering results in higher blood creatinine, which is typically indicative of decreased kidney function, thereby causing physicians concern that the patient is suffering from kidney damage. However, an increase in blood creatinine levels may also be due to changes in blood flow, a hemodynamic effect that is benign to the patient.  Sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a relatively new class of drugs for treating type 2 diabetes, which have been shown to result in lower risk for progression to dialysis in long-term follow-up. However, when patients first begin a therapeutic regimen of SGLT2 inhibitors, they typically experience an acute change in blood flow to the kidney, which results in a rise in serum creatinine. This causes concerns to practitioners that the drug may be harming the kidneys, rather than being beneficial long term. While some patients may indeed experience intrinsic kidney damage due to marked reductions in blood flow, resulting in cessation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy and the benefit associated therewith, there is currently no way to differentiate between these two patterns of creatinine change. Thus, a need exists for diagnostic test to differentiate intrinsic kidney damage from hemodynamic changes in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetes mellitus.\nResearchers at UC San Diego have an invention that is based on a discovery of a number of biomarkers that can differentiate between hemodynamic changes in serum creatinine from intrinsic kidney damage in patients taking SLGT2 inhibitors for diabetes mellitus. The present invention provides methods for monitoring kidney health using a panel of biomarkers in a subject undergoing treatment for diabetes mellitus where the therapeutic regimen results in increased levels of blood creatinine.\nThe present invention provides a panel of 8 biomarkers for use in diagnosing and/or monitoring kidney health. Moreover, the present invention provides methods for predicting an adverse health condition in a subject undergoing a therapeutic regimen for diabetes mellitus.\nThe discovery of 8 biomarkers to assess kidney health that can distinguish hemodynamic from intrinsic kidney changes especially in regards to monitor diabetic patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors for the first time.\nThe method includes measuring the levels of biomarkers in a biological sample from the subject and comparing the measured levels against reference levels obtained from a control subject.\u00a0 In various embodiments, an increase in the measured levels as compared to the control levels is indicative of intrinsic kidney damage and progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the subject and the treatment for diabetes mellitus should be discontinued and/or the subject should be administered an alternative therapeutic regimen.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Various examples of delivering continuous auditory stimulation of various kinds (sometimes referred to by the term \u201centrainment\u201d) have been proposed to modulate brainwaves for therapeutic effect. Current methods of delivering continuous auditory stimulation typically present noises (in the form of clicks, tones, pulses) embedded in music. By modulating the user\u2019s existing audial environment to embed continuous auditory sound stimulation, this technology creates a more tolerable and user-friendly experience that enables prolonged therapeutic stimulation for such neurodegenerative disorders as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE).\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed a method comprised of receiving ambient acoustic information in proximity of a user, modulating a portion of the received ambient acoustic information and delivering an acoustic signal to the user. The acoustic signal comprises the modulated portion of the received ambient acoustic information. The use of such methods, while promising, has been fairly limited by the nature of stimuli used (e.g. recorded or generated sounds that interfere with a user\u2019s life). The present method represents a breakthrough that solves this problem by allowing for continuous brain stimulation over long periods without distracting or disrupting the user.\n\nThe invention has a large number of applications.\u00a0 For example, a more clinical version of the method could be used in hospitals through set of specially designed headphones with built in processing or an external processing unit. This device would function to amplitude modulate the often intense sounds in the hospital environment to either prevent hospital delirium from developing (a pervasive problem with hospitalized elderly) or to help calm anxious patients without isolating them from others.\n\nThis invention is unique in two ways. First, it uses ambient sound as carrier signal for the stimulus. This has never been done and is radically different from existing methods. Second, the method integrates a number of other unique or otherwise innovative methods including injection of sound stimuli when ambient noise is low and use of naturalistic stimuli to drive more naturalistic brain rhythms. While the first point, above, is itself very novel, taken together, these features comprise a comprehensive and potentially transformative new method.\n\nThe current state of development has a fully functioning software version in operation. The current iteration performs all of the functions described above but is limited to use on personal computers, tablets or smart phones. Future iterations will be device-specific with next target devices being hearing aids and \u201dhearables\u201d connected to hi-fidelity Bluetooth earbuds.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego patented ScatterMIMO, which uses smart surfaces to increase the scattering in the environment, to provide MIMO spatial multiplexing gain. Specifically, smart surface pairs up with a wireless transmitter device (say an active AP) and re-radiates the same amount of power as any active access point (AP), thereby creating virtual passive APs. ScatterMIMO avoids the synchronization, interference, and power requirements of conventional distributed MIMO systems by leveraging virtual passive APs, allowing its smart surface to provide spatial multiplexing gain, which can be deployed at a very low cost. We show that with optimal placement, these virtual APs can provide signals to their clients with power comparable to real active APs, and can increase the coverage of an AP. Furthermore, the technology design includes algorithms to optimize ScatterMIMO's smart surface for each client with minimal measurement overhead and to overcome random per-packet phase offsets during the measurement. Initial evaluations show that with commercial off-the-shelf MIMO WiFi (11ac) AP and unmodified clients, ScatterMIMO provides a median throughput improvement of 2 X over the active AP alone. In the last decade, the bandwidth expansion and MIMO spatial multiplexing have promised to increase data throughput by orders of magnitude. However, we are yet to enjoy such improvement in real-world environments, as they lack rich scattering and preclude effective MIMO spatial multiplexing.",

Current methods used are either drug therapy or various physical barriers but their success is limited. \nResearchers from UC San Diego have patented an improved method of protecting cardiac tissue or another tissue found in the thoracic cavity of an individual with an in-situ postsurgical anti-adhesion barrier.

The hydrogel that is formed is capable of adhering to the tissue for about two or more weeks and it greatly reduces cellular adhesion and protein adsorption onto the tissue.  When a two polymers are mixed, they react to form an oxime cross-linked biocompatible hydrogel on the tissue that creates a protective layer over the tissue to prevent post-surgical tissue adhesions.\n\nThese materials are PEG hydrogels crosslinked with oxime bonds, providing a tunable system to control gelling time.\n\nVarious gels have been made and tested both for tunable properties and compatability with fibroblasts, coating ability to heart surfaces and evaluation of adhesion prevention in a rat surgery model.",

It also provides a robust vehicle to deliver a wide range of clinically important therapeutic products, such as genetically engineered-enhanced cytokines, plasmids, gene therapy constructs, oncolytic viruses, small therapeutic RNAs, and peptides.While some cell therapies have experienced success, many current cell therapies fall short in that enough cells do not reach the target tissue and/or the cells are incapable of producing clinically relevant thresholds of desired products sufficient to impact the disease state. Consequently, there is a major fundamental need to genetically engineer therapeutic cells to be more effective and robust using integrating viruses and powerful gene editing technologies like CRISPR, which can target ten to hundreds of genes simultaneously. However, this is highly problematic because the process of genetic engineering introduces dangerous unwanted mutations into the genome that can lead to cancer and other life-threatening diseases, especially if such cells permanently engraft into the body or fuse with host cells, which is common with stem cells. Therefore, the FDA does not readily permit the introduction of new genetic material or the extensive alteration of endogenous genes in cell-based therapies with the exception of CAR-T cells. For this reason, there is a major underlying need in the cell therapy sector to genetically enhance therapeutic cells to express gene products encoding biologics and then render them safe prior to clinical use.This new delivery platform offers an added convenience as a cellular vehicle to deliver therapeutically important biomolecules that potentially be used to treat a broad spectrum of diseases in a safe manner.",

The underlying computation of HD involves a substantial number of element-wise operations (e.g., addition and multiplications) on ultra-wise hypervectors, in the granularities of as small as a single bit, which can be effectively parallelized and pipelined.\u00a0In addition, though different HD applications might vary in terms of number of input features and output classes (labels), they generally follow the same computation flow.

A separate 200-person validation cohort confirms the connection between B. vulgatus proteases and UC severity. Moreover, the multi-omics analysis of the 200 patient cohort extends our observations to Crohn\u2019s disease. _Bacteroides vulgatus_ disrupted intestinal epithelial permeability _in vitro,_ but protease inhibition was sufficient to restore the epithelial barrier. When fecal material from UC patients are transplanted into germ-free mice, these mice ended up with increased colitis. However, oral administration of protease inhibitors attenuated disease severity. This means that targeting microbial proteases can ameliorate the intestinal barrier dysfunction and restore mucosal integrity. The inventors have provided methods that target microbial proteases (MP) to ameliorate the intestinal barrier dysfunction and restore mucosal integrity. MP are useful to treat and prevent diseases and disorders caused by pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal system of a subject.

The typical execution of an ALE experiment involves cultivating a population of microorganisms in defined conditions (i.e., in a laboratory) for a period of time that enables the selection of improved phenotypes.

    "ip_description": "Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease with limited treatment options and a high mortality rate. Pancreatic cancer is the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in the United States; despite some recent advances in systemic therapy, survival remains dismal in large part due to its profound drug resistance and its propensity for early metastasis. Typically, diagnosis of pancreatic cancer occurs only with advanced stages of the disease since there are currently no early markers for detection. Individuals with pancreatic cancer have a poor prognosis due to the late diagnosis, the extent of metastasis, and ineffective treatments. Survival rates are dismal and pancreatic cancer is not typically responsive to radiation and chemotherapy. An alternative approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer as well as the design of a new class of therapeutics that can be used to treat this devastating disease is an immediate unmet medical need.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego identified unique combinations of drugs that together lead to very effective killing of pancreatic cancer cells and elicit rapid and nearly complete tumor regression in preclinical models.\n\nEarly attempts to starve cancer cells to death as a therapeutic strategy had focused on the use of various autophagy inhibitors. However, we found that treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with autophagy inhibitors result in rapid development of acquired drug resistance due to activation of an alternative nutrient procurement pathway. We identified the mechanism responsible for activation of this novel survival pathway and have shown that its inhibition using clinically approved compounds, that can be subjected to further refinement, in combination with inhibition of autophagy results in rapid and near complete regression of human pancreatic cancer grown in mice\n\nSeveral potent inhibitors of autophagy have been developed but none of them is very efficacious _in vivo_ due to rapid development of drug resistance. Inhibitors of the alternative nutrient procurement pathway we identified overcome this resistance mechanism. While drugs that inhibit the alternative nutrient procurement or block its induction in autophagy-inhibited cells have already been used individually in cancer no one has attempted to combine them with autophagy inhibitors and nobody has tested whether such combinations elicit efficacious tumor regression _in vivo_.\n\nThe invention has been reduced to practice in preclinical models and cell cultures of human pancreatic cancer.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC San Diego designed new allelic-drive systems that permit the efficient Super-Mendelian transmission (>>50%) of a desired allelic variant of a gene of interest to progeny. These allelic-drive systems build on CRISPR-based active genetic systems that we have previously developed in flies , mosquitoes and, most recently, in mice in which gene-drive cassettes are copied efficiently from one chromosome to another in the germline. Here we adapt these active genetic methods to preferentially transmit allelic variants (allelic-drive) resulting from only a single or a few nucleotide substitutions. We demonstrate allelic drive in two configurations: one, copy-cutting, in which a non-preferred allele is selectively targeted for Cas9/guide RNA (gRNA) cleavage, and a more general approach, copy-grafting, that permits selective inheritance of a desired allele located at some distance from the gRNA cut site **.**\n\nWe also characterize a phenomenon we refer to as lethal-mosaicism, that dominantly eliminates NHEJ-induced mutations and favors inheritance of functional cleavage-resistant alleles. The basis for lethal mosaicism is that mutant alleles produced by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) in an essential gene become dominantly lethal during the drive process. In contrast, a protected non-cleavable functional allele of the gene, remains immune to such lethal mosaicism. Thus, lethal mosaicism results in selective elimination of un-desired alleles generated by NHEJ.\n\nExpand the gene-drive tool kit to include biased Super-Mendelian inheritance of beneficial allelic variants (e.g., pesticide sensitivity, or alleles conferring resistance to pathogens in vector species) along with a gene-drive element, as well as deleterious mutations for population suppression strategies.\u00a0\u00a0Generate more efficient gene-drive systems that eliminate drive-resistant mutant alleles during the drive process.\n\nLethal mosaicism offers the only current solution to the major \u201cdrive resistance\u201d concern. Next-generation drive systems thus may include a recoded functional portion of a gene inserted in-frame into the endogenous copy of that gene, resulting in a functional chimeric gene immune to Cas9-mediated cleavage. Progeny inheriting such a gene-drive including a protected copy of the gene would then be immune to lethal mosaicism, while those inheriting NHEJ-induced non-functional mutations would all die. This strategy represents a major advance in the field of gene-drive, since transmission of drive-resistant NHEJ alleles represent a prominent obstacle in all prior experiments and models.\n\nThe invention is at the proof-of-concept stage.",

There are 20 members of the Rho family in mammals, of which four (Rac1, Rac2, Rac3, RhoG) belong to the Rac subfamily. Each Rac GTPase functions as a molecular switch by cycling between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form. In addition to their normal cellular functions, Rac GTPases contribute to cancer development as downstream effectors of growth factor receptor signaling and oncogenic mutations in the Ras pathway. Rac GTPases represent attractive targets for therapy in hematologic cancer, however direct targeting of small GTPases has proved difficult and largely ineffective. A thorough understanding of the diverse mechanisms controlling Rac activation in cancer will therefore be essential towards identifying new therapeutic avenues and improving outcomes in patients\n\nOne insight into the regulation/activation of the Rac GTPases involves examining Ras proteins and their signal transduction pathways since mutations that produce abnormally active Ras proteins are found in 30% of all human cancers.\u00a0Moreover, after activation, RAS signaling is mediated through interaction with RAS-binding domains or through the domain RAS association (RA), transmitted to downstream effectors.\u00a0Notably, many downstream effectors are oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that are mutated or silenced in cancers independently of RAS.\u00a0Ras proteins are involved in Ras association domain-containing protein 2 (RASSF2)\u00a0and it has recently been shown that in Acute myeloid leukemia cells with low expression of RASSF2 are more resistant to pharmacological inhibition of Dedicator of cytokinesis protein 2 (DOCK2), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Acute myeloid leukemia cells with high expression of RASSF2 are sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of DOCK2.\n\nTargeting Rac GTPases through inhibition of DOCK2 may be an effective therapy in acute myeloid leukemia, and our invention describes a biomarker that is predictive of when this therapy would be most effective.",

    "ip_description": "Endoscopes are used in many fields of medicine to investigate, diagnose, and treat patients. One common procedure that utilizes an endoscope (known as a bronchoscope), is the procedure of intubation that is conducted over 16 million times in the United States annually. To intubate a patient successfully, a physician needs to insert an endotracheal tube (ETT) into the patient\u2019s mouth and secure it in the airway. A delay in securing the ETT into position of greater than 4 minutes can result in permanent brain injury or death of the patient. Malfunction of an indwelling ETT itself or changes in the airway anatomy may lead to emergent need for ETT exchange. The bronchoscope is the gold standard device for confirming the proper placement of an ETT in the trachea and the ultimate method for regaining control. A detachable endoscope design offers additional key advantages potentially allowing the insertion tube portion to be an economical, disposable, single patient use device, eliminating the concern over superbug cross contamination and reducing cost of processing and maintenance.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have come up with an alternative prototype which consists of an elongated insertion tube sensing device. The device includes an insertion tube with a detachable control handle. Channels, electrical connections, and a drive train in the control handle can be quickly and simply detached, preferably by the press of a button. When connected to the handle, operation of sensors and mechanical movements of a distal end of the insertion tube can be controlled via one or more threads in the control handle.\n\nThe main application of the invention is elongate insertion tube sensing devices for use that includes medical devices, such as endoscopes, including but not limited to bronchoscopes.\n\nThis design allows for separation of the handle from the insertion tube of the endoscope in order to allow for safe exchange of endotracheal tubes for patients in critically ill conditions then reattachment and direct visualization of the airway for confirmation of proper tube placement. Endoscopic visualization of the airway is the gold standard for confirmation of proper placement during these critical conditions. Other detachable endoscopes currently on the market to fail to serve both functions of endotracheal tube exchanger as well as endoscopic visualization tool.\n\nWorking prototype and experimentation stage.",

The invention provides for methods, compositions and kits that utilize total Oxidized phospholipids to determine whether a subject has liver disease. Measurement of Total OxPL could be a valuable biomarker of the development of NASH. Our current data suggests it distinguishes patients with NAFL (fatty liver only) from patients with NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis). There is currently no way to measure Total OxPL in plasma or serum of animal models or humans. The researchers have developed in an assay that directly measures OxPL on apoB\u2010100 containing lipoproteins and that for the most part this measures OxPL on Lipoprotein (a) particles, which contain apoB\u2010100 and are enriched in OxPL. This assay does not measure OxPL on non\u2010apoB particles. The assay is functional and has been used to show elevated levels of Total OxPL in NASH in both mice models and human patients. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States. It can be broadly sub-classified into nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), which is thought to have minimal risk of progression to cirrhosis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is thought to have an increased risk of progression to cirrhosis. The current diagnostic gold standard for differentiating whether a patient with NAFLD has NAFL versus NASH is liver biopsy. However, liver biopsy is an invasive procedure, which is limited by sampling variability, cost, and may be complicated by morbidity and even death, although rare. Accurate, non-invasive, biomarkers for the detection of liver disease and liver disease progression e.g., progression to NASH, are currently also not available.",

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition in which excess fat is stored in the liver, though not caused by heavy alcohol use. NAFLD is one of the most common causes of liver disease in the United States.

Mechanisms of NAFLD progression are poorly understood.\u00a0Experts estimate that about 20% of people with NAFLD have NASH. Between 30% and 40% of adults in the United States have NAFLD.

    "ip_description": "Biologists from UC San Diego have identified functionally-redundant Raf-like MAPKK kinases (M3Ks) that activate OST1/SnRK2 kinases. These M3Ks are essential for the re-activation of SnRK2 kinases after deactivation by the PP2C phosphatases through a specific M3K-targeted phosphorylation site in the SnRK2 kinase activation-loop (OST1-Ser-171) which is essential for SnRK2 kinase function and ABA signal transduction. CRISPR/Cas9 deletion, T-DNA insertion and amiRNA knock-down plants independently reveal that these M3Ks play an important role in ABA responses. The identified M3Ks provide an opportune mechanism for tuning the ABA and abiotic stress response of plants.\n\nReactivation of dephosphorylated SnRK2 requires these M3Ks, and ABA-induced OST1/SnRK2.6 activation and S-type anion channel activation requires the presence of M3Ks. M3K knock-out plants show not only reduced sensitivity to ABA but also strongly impaired osmotic stress-induced SnRK2 activation. These results demonstrate that these Raf-like M3Ks are required for ABA- and osmotic stress-activation of SnRK2 kinases, ensuring robust ABA and osmotic stress signal transduction. Our advance additionally provides an important mechanism for modulating the osmotic stress sensing machinery.\nM3Ks provide a new genetic engineering target to improve plant abiotic stress resistance when global fresh water supply is limiting and the effects of abiotic stress or climate-linked stress on plants are limiting to crop yields and robust tree growth.\u00a0Interestingly, the \u00a0findings further demonstrate that these M3Ks are required for the rapid osmotic stress activation of SnRK2 protein kinases through an ABA-independent pathway. Genome editing can be accomplished using unrestricted Thalen technology\n\nThis invention can be used to enhance:\n\n*   drought tolerance of crop plants\n*   salinity of tolerance of crop plants\n*   early monitoring of drought, salinity and cold stress by crop plants and trees\n*   early mounting of stress resistance in crop plants and trees.\n\nBased on the ubiquitous important role of SnRK2 protein kinases in plant drought and abiotic stress resistance, M3K-mediated modulation of SnRK2s could be an effective approach for increasing plant stress resistance, which could be broadly applicable to agricultural crops. Prior to this advance, no methodology has been established to selectively activate SnRK2 kinases in plants without applications of ABA or osmotic stress.",

The building blocks of the model are spiking neurons, spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic rules, known experimentally, which are shown to play a fundamental role in both keeping the network stable and capable of continous learning. \nThe network utilized both reward modulated and nonreward modulated STDP and implemented multiple mechanisms for homeostatic regulation of synaptic efficacy, including heterosynaptic plasticity, gain control, output balancing, activity normalization of rewarded STDP and hard limits on synaptic strength. The team found that addition of a hidden layer of neurons employing nonrewarded STDP created neurons that were responsive to the combinations of inputs and thus performed basic classification of the input patterns. When combined with a following layer of neurons implementing rewarded STDP, the network was able to learn discrimination between rewarding patterns and the patterns designated as punishing. The model predicts a minimal set of properties for the spiking neuronal network with STDP that was sufficient to solve a complex foraging tasks involving pattern classification. \n\nBehind the model is a neural network which, compared to usual methods used in machine learning, uses only biologically known mechanisms on cellular level (neurons).

This tool successfully enriched red blood cell (RBC)-specific effector proteins secreted by GAS. Among the identified proteins were known blood toxins, such as Streptolysin O and CAMP factor, as well as several proteins of unknown function. One of these unknown proteins (S protein) was characterized using an in\u2010frame deletion mutant (\u0394ess-GAS) and tested on the impact of S protein on GAS physiology. In vivo, the absence of S protein results in a striking attenuation of virulence in mice. In addition, the researchers showed that the \u0394ess-GAS mutant protected mice later infected with wild-type GAS while those mice which did not receive \u0394ess- mutant GAS before the challenge with wild-type GAS resulted in a 90% mortality rate. Preliminary data suggests that infection with the \u0394ess-mutant GAS stimulated an IFN\u2010mediated immune response that resulted in the development of adaptive immunity.\n\nThe innovation of this work is twofold: 1) S protein shows promise for the development of a vaccine against GAS as it can potentially prevent not only strep throat and impetigo but also more serious invasive disease and postinfectious complications like rheumatic fever, 2) S protein is an ideal target for anti-virulence therapeutics as inactivation of S protein function would make GAS vulnerable to host immunity.\n\nThe absence of S protein attenuates virulence to a greater extent than other key and long-studied GAS virulence factors at equal inoculum (e.g. Streptolysins and M protein), with mice demonstrating 100% survival when challenged with an S protein-null strain of GAS. Therefore, S protein as a target for therapeutic development against GAS is of high significance. Moreover, the identified immune pathways associated with immune memory are strongly associated with positive outcomes against GAS infection. These host factors could be a starting point for future investigation into host-centered GAS therapies.\n\nThe inventors have shown that S protein can protect mice against successive systemic infection with a wild type strain. They have also experimented with dosage amounts for the protection. Functional experiments further show that deletion of S protein significantly alters the GAS \u201csurfome\u201d (display of surface exposed proteins), including M protein, the best studied and most abundant GAS virulence factor.",

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), FLS become aggressive and invasive, contributing to many aspects of RA pathology. FLS produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that break down the ECM, directly invade and digest the articular cartilage, promote bone erosion, and promote inflammation through secretion of interleukin 6 (IL-6), chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators. FLS are highly sensitive to the inflammatory environment present in rheumatoid joints. Growth factors, especially platelet-derived growvth factor (PDGF), stimulate FLS invasiveness. Inflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and interleukin-I (IL-1), enhance FLS aggressiveness, pro-inflammatory features and MMP production. Targeting of molecules that control FLS invasiveness and inflammatory output is being considered an option for development of new therapies for RA.\n\nMany signaling pathways controlling FLS behavior rely upon phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues, which results from the balanced action of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and phosphatases (PTPs).

Hepatocellular death plays an essential role in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).The activity of the energy sensor AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is repressed in NASH and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Liver-specific AMPK knockout exaggerates liver damage in several models of diet-induced NASH.

This represents a new biological site for the therapeutic intervention for NASH. The current state of development is at the experimental data stage.  Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by hepatic steatosis with inflammation and liver damage, has become the leading cause of transplant and liver associated death.\u00a0Moreover, numerous studies suggest that hepatocellular death is the key event triggering progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis for NASH and perhaps other liver diseases.\u00a0\u00a0In normal liver, hepatocyte apoptosis plays a key role in liver homeostasis, maintaining equilibrium between the loss and replacement of hepatocytes. However, pathological conditions such as viral infection, alcoholic or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and physical injury, lead to extensive hepatocyte apoptosis and liver damage. While inflammation contributes to the pericellular fibrosis at an early stage, sustained liver damage leads to scarring, bridging fibrosis and subsequent development of cirrhosis. Moreover, hepatocellular death is the major contributor to the pathogenesis of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which hepatocellular death is controlled may lead to new treatments for liver diseases.",

    "ip_description": "Human Ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 7 (UBA7) is a protein is involved in protein modification, specifically involving the pathway for protein ubiquitination.\u00a0The modification of proteins with ubiquitin is an important cellular mechanism for targeting abnormal or short-lived proteins for degradation. Ubiquitination involves at least three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes, or E1s, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, or E2s, and ubiquitin-protein ligases, or E3s. UBA7 \u00a0encodes a member of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme family.\u00a0Moreover, ubiquitination and ubiquitin-like post-translational modifications (PTMs) regulate activity and stability of oncoproteins and tumor suppressors.\n\nBiomarkers are very important as companion diagnostic tools to guide clinical practice in treating human cancers, especially for targeted therapies. In the era of precision medicine, it is important for development companion diagnostic tools that can guide clinical practice for treating human cancers using targeted therapies.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have observed the tumor suppressive effect of UBA7 in preclinical mouse models. By analyzing cancer transcriptome and related clinical information, they observed UBA7 and its regulated genes have prognostic value in human cancers. Therefore, UBA7 or a combination of UBA7 and its regulated genes (CXCL9, CXCL 10, CCL5 and PML) can serve as biomarkers to guide clinical practice in some of currently used cancer therapies as well as UBA7/USP18 targeted therapies in the future.\n\nUse as companion diagnostic tools by measuring UBA7 expression or a combination of UBA7 with any of a group of listed genes (CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL 10, CXCL 11, PML) to guide clinical practice in treating human cancers.\n\nCurrent stage: working prototype stage.\u00a0The researchers have analyzed UBA7 expression in melanoma patients based on RNA sequencing and observed that UBA7 expression is predictive of therapeutic response and patient survival in these patients.\u00a0Expression of UBA7 is associated with a panel of genes, which are predictive of therapeutic response to cancer immunotherapies. Therefore, UBA7 or a combination UBA7 with any of a group of its related genes are novel biomarkers for cancer immunotherapies.",

It was tested on ~100 real datasets (the largest dataset contains 2M reads) and, from this point of view, presents an improvement upon the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art. In particularly, IgEvolution detects important mutations in antigen\u2010specific antibodies, identifies antibody sites with high mutability, and reveals antibody sites under high selective pressure. This part of the tool is novel and was not done before. The tool can be used for computational design of antibody drugs, analysis of vaccine efficacy, and humanization of nonhuman antibodies. Clonal analysis has the potential to reveal errors in the constructed repertoires and contribute to constructing more accurate repertoires, we advocate a\u00a0_tree-guided construction of antibody repertoires_\u00a0that combines error correction and clonal reconstruction as interconnected (rather than independent) tasks. We developed the IgEvolution algorithm for simultaneous repertoire and clonal tree reconstruction and applied it for analyzing multiple immunosequencing datasets representing antigen-specific immune responses. The inventors demonstrate that analysis of clonal trees reveals highly mutable positions that correlate with antigen-binding sites and light-chain contacts in crystallized antibody-antigen complexes. They also demonstrate that this analysis leads to a new approach for refining positions of complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in antibodies. Constructing antibody repertoires is an important error-correcting step in analyzing immunosequencing datasets that is important for reconstructing evolutionary (clonal) development of antibodies. However, the state-of-the-art repertoire construction tools typically miss low-abundance antibodies that often represent internal nodes in clonal trees and are crucially important for clonal tree reconstruction. Thus, although repertoire construction is a prerequisite for follow up clonal tree reconstruction, the existing repertoire reconstruction algorithms are not well suited for this task because they typically miss low-abundance antibodies that often represent internal nodes in clonal trees and are crucially important for clonal tree reconstruction.",

    "ip_description": "Currently, renewable fatty acids are obtained solely from plant oils. Medium chain fatty acids (C8-C14) are typically sourced from coconut and palm oil, whereas longer chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are typically sourced from tallow, soy, corn or sunflower oil. Fatty acids are widely used for food, personal care products, industrial applications (e.g., lubricants, adhesives, detergents and plastics), as well as increasingly as biofuels. The demand for renewable fatty acids is rising and expanding.\nGiven the current understanding of biological pathways it becomes possible to utilize other organisms, especially microorganisms, for the production of renewable chemicals such as fatty acids.\nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed a method for the production of renewable fatty acids from a photosynthetic prokaryotic microorganism, Anabaena PCC7120. Specifically, the engineered Anabaena strains described below can generate medium chain saturated fatty acids with narrow chain length specificity whereby the fatty acids are secreted into the culture medium thus allowing for separation of fatty acid product from cell mass. \nThis invention can be used to produce high levels of renewable fatty acids using carbon dioxide and sunlight as an energy source. The fatty acids can be subsequently used as chemical feedstocks or can also be converted to biodiesel with superior fuel properties. \nExpression of plant thioesterase genes in cyanobacteria allows for the production of fatty acids in a prokaryotic photosynthetic organism as opposed to heterotrophic bacteria or plants. Whereas high level production of medium chain fatty acids in E.coli requires inactivation of the fatty acid beta oxidation pathway, similar measures are not required in cyanobacteria. The chain length specificity of the produced fatty acids is tightly controlled allowing for the generation of highly pure fatty acid feedstocks. Moreover, the high levels of secretable fatty acids were obtained following modification of the plant thioesterase genes, specifically removal of the N-terminal membrane signaling sequences significantly improved yield of fatty acids\nThe researchers have demonstrated production and secretion of fatty acids in two species of cyanobacteria. Both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids can be produced, moreover, fatty acids of C8-C18 chain length can be produced. Further development will be geared toward yield improvement of the fatty acid titer and productivity.",

Signs and symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine.\u00a0 The treatment of schistosomiasis serves three purposes: reversing acute or early chronic disease, preventing complications associated with chronic infection, and preventing neuroschistosomiasis. The goal of treatment is to remove the worms that produce the eggs which, in turn, are responsible for disease morbidity and mortality. There is no effective vaccine against schistosomiasis.\n\nThe main treatment for schistosomiasis today as recommended by the WHO involves the use of a generic drug, praziquantel (PZQ), which has been successful because of its high efficacy, low toxicity, and its ease as a single, oral administration. Still, PZQ is not effective against the immature stages of schistosomes and has some pharmacological limitations. Other drugs that are used less frequently are:\u00a0 oxamniquine (only effective against intestinal schistosomiasis), artesunate and mefloquine, but by far PZQ is the most used drug and the most effective one.\u00a0 However, resistance to existing drugs is always a concern for the future.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC San Diego have developed methods for treating eosinophilic inflammatory diseases and fibrosis. This involves the use of a local or system administration of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) to subjects having fibrosis resulting from an inflammatory eosinophilic disease or disorder. The resulting treatment demonstrates that TZDs can inhibit and reduce fibrotic formation.\n\nEsophageal inflammatory disorders are gaining increased recognition in both adults and children. One example is eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), which is an emerging and fast-growing disorder characterized by high levels of eosinophils in the esophagus, as well as esophageal cellular changes such as basal zone hyperplasia and esophageal remodeling that includes fibrosis and smooth muscle dysfunction. These complications can lead to trouble swallowing, strictures,and food impactions. EoE is thought to be provoked, in at least a subset of patients, by food allergies or airborne allergen exposure. EoE diagnosis is often associated with other hypersensitivity disorders, including asthma, rhinitis, and other food and aeroallergen inhalant sensitivities. Diagnosis requires the finding of 15 or more eosinophils per high power field (eos/hpf) within esophageal mucosal biopsies.\n\nAlthough EoE is becoming more frequently diagnosed throughout developing countries, many aspects of the disease remain unclear including its etiology, natural history and optimal therapy. Symptoms of EoE often mimic those of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and include vomiting, dysphagia, pain and food impaction. In the absence of long-term treatment, up to 70-80% of adults with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) may go on to develop esophageal strictures. This disease now is likely to occur in 1 in 1000 people in the population and will have a dramatic effect on the patients\u2019 quality of life. While there are therapies that control inflammation, not all patients respond to these therapies and continue to progress to fibrotic changes. There are currently no medical treatments to directly target esophageal fibrosis.\n\nAdd-on therapy to treat the fibrotic and remodeling consequences of EoE\n\nThis represents a new use for this class of drugs.\n\nWe have demonstrated in preclinical studies that thiazolidinediones decrease the expression of a subset of pro-fibrotic and myofibroblast genes in EoE, but not in normal, esophageal fibroblasts. We have further demonstrated that EoE but not normal esophageal biopsies express PPAR-\u03b3, the receptor for thiazolidinediones.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Heart failure (HF) is a disease of epidemic portions in the United States affecting over 6 million patients with heart failure in the US, with 400,000 new cases per year. It is the most common cause of non-elective admission to the hospital in subjects 65 yrs and older. The introduction of new drugs over the last 30 years that target pathways critical to progression of HF, along with implantable cardiac defibrillators and resynchronization devices have shown some successes, however, both the morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure remains at unacceptable levels, with as many as 30-40% of affected individuals dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Recently, preclinical and clinical trials have tested gene transfer to increase left ventricular (LV) function, especially in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.\n\nAdenylyl cyclase (AC) is a transmembrane protein in cardiac myocytes and other cells, the effector molecule for beta-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2AR) and other G protein-coupled receptors, which regulates the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to 30,50-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and thereby initiates a variety of intracellular signaling cascades that influence heart function and additional physiological events. There are 9 membrane bound isoforms (AC1 to AC9); however, increased cardiac expression of AC type 6 (AC6), a dominant AC isoform expressed in mammalian cardiac myocytes, has protean beneficial effects on the failing left ventricle. These beneficial effects, consistent in several species and models appear in large part do not depend upon increased cAMP generation. A phase 2 randomized clinical trial in patients with symptomatic heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fractions showed that intracoronary AC6 gene transfer appears to be safe and potentially effective, and not associated with increased cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, AC6 gene transfer may be suitable for treatment of heart failure.  \nResearchers at VA San Diego and UC San Diego have generated an AC6 mutant (AC6mut) molecule  which retains the cellular distribution pattern and favorable signaling effects associated with normal AC6, but which does not generate cAMP upon \u03b2AR stimulation\u2014yet has similar favorable effects on LV function as does normal AC6. These data demonstrate that AC6 does not require increased cAMP generation.  \nIn another set of studies, scientists eliminated the two transmembrane domains of normal AC6, yielding a protein with an intact catalytic domain, designated C1C2, that is disengaged from membrane-associated \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation, but with an enhanced propensity for intracellular interactions with other proteins, which, ultimately, enhance Ca2+ handling and thus systolic and diastolic heart function.  Transgenic mice with cardiac-directed C1C2 are resistant to the delirious effects of LV pressure overload, as can be seen in clinical hypertension \n\nThis transgene, C1C2, is sufficiently small to be packaged in an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, unlike normal AC6 of AC6mut, increasing the flexibility of delivery. A one-time vascular delivery of a gene transfer product is a novel approach to the treatment of clinical heart failure, and its mechanism of action (increases cardiac myocyte Ca2+ handling) would likely be additive to current therapies.  \n\nTransgenic mice with cardiac-directed expression of C1C2 exhibit resistance to sustained adrenergic stimulation compared with transgene (TG) negative (control) siblings. Transgenic mice with cardiac-directed C1C2, a fusion protein of the intracellular Cl and C2 segments of adenylyl cyclase type 6, had normal left ventricular (LV) function, but diminished cAMP generation. Cardiac myocytes from C1C2 mice showed increased Ca2+ release. Furthermore, a virus vector encoding C1C2 will soon be studied.",

In addition, these vectors can be used to deliver a variety of transgenes to treat various joint diseases, whereby apoptosis regulating genes that can kill synovial cells resulting in a functional and anatomical improvement in a treated joint.  \n\nThe transgene is injected into the patient\u2019s diseased joint or tumor in conjunction with the administration of the proper vectors. The therapy will avoid repeated surgeries, which can lead to disability and pathologic fractures. \n\nCurrent vectors are relatively inefficient and high concentrations are needed to infect synovial cells. The newly engineered vector increases efficiency dramatically. In addition, synovial cells are relatively resistant to apoptosis. We discovered that this can be overcome with specific transgenes that bypass this resistance, most notably PUMA and other members of the BH3-only Bcl2 family members. For PVNS, patients could avoid repeated surgeries and could instead be treated with intra-articular therapy.\n\nIn vitro proof of concept using cultured synovial cells has been completed and confirms the ability of the construct to efficiently kill the synovial cells.

    "ip_description": "Many diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) arise from the accumulation of proteins such as \u03b1-synuclein (aSyn) in Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) or A\u00df in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). The ability to regulate the expression at the gene transcription level would be beneficial for reducing the accumulation of these proteins or regulating expression levels of other genes in the CNS. aSyn also accumulates in other neurodegenerative diseases including dementia with Lewy Body (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Gaucher\u2019s disease. This means that regulation of aSyn expression may be crucial to the therapeutic control of numerous neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed a novel peptide (ApoB11) and method for the delivery of anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASO) to the CNS by intra-venous delivery. The ApoB11 peptide is derived from the apolipoprotein B protein with the addition of a glycine linker and arginine tail. This peptide allows the delivery of ASOs to the brain following the less-invasive intra-venous or even intra-peritoneal injection versus the current intra-thecal injection route for CNS ASO delivery used now.\n\nThe ApoB11 peptide could be used to deliver any form or design of nucleotides including, but not limited to: cDNA, mRNA, siRNA, shRNA, miRNA, gRNA or synthetic nucleotide sequences. Delivery of oligonucleotides to the CNS could be beneficial for neurodegenerative diseases, neuro-modulatory treatments, cancers of the CNS, gene targeted editing of the CNS or anti-microbial gene delivery of the CNS.\n\nThe peptide utilized in this invention is an endogenous peptide that would be less likely to elicit an immune response than a foreign, virus-based peptide. Additionally, we have ample evidence showing that delivery with this peptide is possible to a wide variety of cells in the CNS.\n\nThe project is complete and has been shown to work in an animal model of disease.",

Named RSBL, this algorithm stands for Recursive Sparse Bayesian Learning.\n\nThe algorithm is based on two key innovations:\n\n> 1.Users explicitly model the corrupting effect artifact sources by augmenting the standard distributed generative model of the M/EEG with an empirical dictionary of non-brain source scalp projections such as those induced by eye, muscle, and single channel spatially uncorrelated spike-like activity.\n\n> 2.Leverage an anatomical brain atlas to encourage the sparsity of the functional images obtained, resulting in a reduced number of relevant brain activations per image, thereby facilitating their interpretation. The sparsity constraint is automatically regulated in a data-driven manner.\n\nWhen the algorithm is used to obtain a time series of brain images (brain mapping/imaging use), the aforementioned innovations have the desired property of inducing the segregation of the cortical electrical activity into a few maximally independent components with known anatomical support, while artifactual activity is also segregated into their respective components (source and artifact separation use). \u00a0Thus, clean data can be obtained by zeroing out the contribution of artifactual sources (data cleaning use).\n\nMATLAB code and examples maybe downloaded for educational use only from the PEB repository: downloaded from the PEB2 repository: https://github.com/aojeda/PEB",

    "ip_description": "Additive Manufacturing (AM) is the process of making 3D objects from a computer model data by joining materials layer by layer under computer control using a 3D printer.   Poplar systems, even for home use, can be purchased that use various polymer plastics. In more robust application areas, metal alloys are required and their manufacturing is much more costly and time intensive. Metal parts created by additive manufacturing are often difficult to dimensionally characterize due to the complex surface structures created by welding phenomena present in state-of- the art printing machines. The most holistic techniques involve measuring the surface of each sintered layer of powder, however, this is complicated to perform in a non-contact, non-destructive, and in-situ manner. Techniques such as Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography can be used to perform this task, but are limited to large pointwise measurement, limiting the speed and resolution of measuring the surface topography of each layer.  Due to the cost associated with additive manufacturing with alloys, reliable inspection methodologies are necessary to ensure that the part being fabricated is free of defects and meets all user specifications. \n\nResearchers at UC San Diego developed a method of layer-by-layer instantaneous area interrogation using a structured light system. The low-cost design allows measurement of high resolution out-of-plane measurements on each build layer, and the quantification of small pores of sizes 0.050 mm and smaller. The measurement system proposed is purposefully selected to be small enough to allow for in-situ implementation inside a variety of different AM machines. Measurement results of the system have been shown on test specimens dimensionally verified with profilometer measurements, presenting the validity of the system.\n\nApplications\nThe disclosed technology can enhance the quality assurance and efficiency of any lab or commercial scale additive manufacturing platform. \nAdvantages\nThe disclosed system is low-cost and small in form factor with the ability to be integrated into existing AM products. \nState Of Development\nA working prototype has been developed and is available for demonstration.",

The approach leverages a quantitative metric for small-worldness and devises a customized rewiring algorithm. The algorithm restructures the inter-layer connections in the in-put CNN to find a topology that balances regularity and randomness, which is the key characteristic of SWNs. Small-world properties in CNNs translates to an architecture where all layers are interlinked via sparse connections. Such networks have similar quality of prediction and number of trainable parameters as their baseline feed-forward architectures, but due to the added sparse links and the optimal SWN connectivity, they warrant better data flow.   As a result, the architecture modification has three main benefits:  \nit removes non-critical connections and reduces computational implications;  \nit increases the degrees of freedom during training, allowing faster convergence; and  \nit provides customized data paths in the model for better cross-layer information propagation.\n\nApplications\nThe disclosed technology can enhance the efficiency of any DNN, as used in image recognition, autonomous vehicles and robotics, etc. \nAdvantages\nDuring benchmarking experiments on various network architectures, SWNets\u2019 performance on popular image classification benchmarks including CI-FAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet achieve an average of 2.1-fold improvement in training iterations required to achieve comparable classification accuracy as the baseline models.

Metabolic syndrome is 2 to 3 times more prevalent than type 2 diabetes and is usually the precursor state for this disease, indicating that this type 2 diabetes epidemic will not abate in the near future. Insulin resistance is a key etiologic feature of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and obesity is far and away the most common cause of insulin resistance in humans. There is a well-known parallel global epidemic of obesity, and the great majority of type 2 diabetic patients are obese. Therefore, it seems logical to conclude that the obesity epidemic is the underlying driver of the type 2 diabetes epidemic. Unfortunately, at the present time there are a limited number of therapeutics available as way of preventing or treating obesity.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have an invention for a method of preventing or treating obesity in a subject via administering an effective amount of an intracellular inhibitor/antagonist to the subject.\u00a0The inventors previously identified a signature of genes that are associated with food intake.

They then used a fasting/re\u2010feeding paradigm in mice to induce hyperphagia and found pre\u2010treatment with a specific inhibitor resulted in significant reduction in food intake. Importantly, obese mice treated with this specific inhibitor for 7 days ate significantly less and lost ~10% of their body weight.\n\nApplication of the inhibitors to weight loss or prevention of obesity.\n\nThis is a novel invention for treating obesity.",

This technology efficiently depalmitoylates proteins at the plasma membrane and internal membranes and is poised to allow the development of novel potential nontoxic drugs for efficient targeting of thioesterase deficiency diseases, such as infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. \n\nThe neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), commonly grouped together as Batten disease, are the most common neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases of the pediatric population. No cure for NCL has yet been realized. Current treatment regimens offer only symptomatic relief and do not target the underlying cause of the disease. Although the underlying pathophysiology that drives disease progression is unknown, several small molecules have been identified with diverse mechanisms of action that provide promise for the treatment of this devastating disease. On this point, several researchers have reported the use of potential drugs for NCL patient lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, along with neurons derived from animal models of NCL disease. Unfortunately, most of these studies were inconclusive or clinical trials or follow-up results were not available. High concentrations employed and toxicity of the small molecules are clear disadvantages to the use of some of the corresponding derivatives as potential drugs. To circumvent these effects, development of nontoxic alkyl cysteines would be useful for the non-enzymatic and chemo-selective depalmitoylation of S-palmitoyl proteins, which hold good promise as an effective treatment for neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. \n\nApplications\n\nThis compound has potential therapeutic applications for a number of diseases in which palmitoylation is dysregulated such as cancer, Alzheimer's, Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis.This technology is poised to become a powerful tool that will aid studies of protein depalmitoylation in vivo.",

    "ip_description": "NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are principal regulators of synaptic signaling in the brain. Modulation of NMDARs\u2019 function and trafficking is important for the regulation of synaptic transmission and several forms of synaptic plasticity. Postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) acts as a scaffolding protein and stabilizes the surface and synaptic expression of NMDARs. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are ionotropic glutamate receptors that are expressed throughout the nervous system and play crucial roles in neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory.\n\nPSD-95 (Post Synaptic Density protein) or SAP90, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK), is the major scaffolding protein in the excitatory postsynaptic density (PSD) and a potent regulator of synaptic strength. It is almost exclusively located in the post synaptic density of neurons and is involved in anchoring synaptic proteins. Its direct and indirect binding partners include neuroligin, NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, and potassium channels. Postsynaptic loss does not precede obvious A\u03b2 (beta-amyloid or amyloid beta) and Tau deposition, but instead appears to occur as A\u03b2 and Tau pathologies advance. This indicates that PSD-95 is an excellent intrinsic biomarker for post synaptic mechanisms and its expression is reduced in brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) as well as in mouse models of AD.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have shown that increased PSD-95, a major synaptic scaffolding molecule, blocks the effects of A\u03b2 on synapses.\u00a0These results indicate that increased PSD-95 protects synapses from A\u03b2 toxicity by interfering with ion-flux independent NMDAR CTD signaling. Using a chemical inhibitor to block its depalmitoylation increases PSD- 95 at synapses and rescues deficits caused by A\u03b2; possibly opening a new therapeutic avenue against AD.\n\nThe inventors have developed a method for treating a neurodegenerative disease by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a polypeptide or an effective amount of an inhibitor of a palmitoylation pathway to increase the amount of PSD-95 in the synapse.",

    "ip_description": "Red light exposure can have phototherapeutic effects on skin cells and other biological cells and tissues affected by UV damage. However, existing methods and devices using red light in DNA phototherapy have not identified the proper duration, intensity, or delivery mechanisms for optimal DNA repair. If the radiant intensity of the red light is too low, then exposure is inadequate and the repair biomarkers are not activated. Conversely, prolonged exposure to excessive electromagnetic radiation only furthers DNA damage. Moreover, in the context of skin treatment, excessive radiant intensity can burn tissue or have carcinogenic side effects. Thus, there is a need for a device and methods of use that provide safe, effective, and targeted red light DNA phototherapy.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed a red therapy device that can be used to repair DNA damage resulting from UV and oxidative damage, as well as general DNA damage where no specific source can be identified. By implementing red light therapy the apparatus can repair DNA in human and non-human animal subjects. The technology will use red light of about of 630 nm in wavelength to trigger the repair and synthesis of DNA. Specifically the technology administers red light therapy through an array of LED lamps in radiant intensities between 180 \u03bcW/cm2 and 50 mW/cm2 with dosage times between 5 minutes and 60 minutes; dosage powers translate to an equivalent energy dosage of 0.05 J/cm2 to 100 J/cm2.\n\n### Applications\n\nCosmetic skin treatment:Treatment of skin tissue for healing, protective, and regenerative effects could be self-administered and used as an \u201cat home\u201d device for sunburn recovery, sunburn protection, reversing or preventing tissue/skin aging, stimulating tissue/skin repair, stimulating tissue/skin regeneration.\n\nIn cell and DNA amplification: Another application would be in the industrial amplification of cell lines and stem cell lines, with resulting genomes expected to have less damage, thereby increasing the genome quality, reproducibility, and viable yield.\n\nCancer: Preliminary evidence would suggest that this therapy could be used to improve the effectiveness of some cancer treatments because of the ability to repair damaged DNA, this would at least in part, restore some natural genetic checkpoints and the related cell-death responses which some cancer treatments leverage to achieve their therapeutic effects.\n\n### Advantages\n\nWavelength: The specific wavelength of 630 nm \u00b1 5 nm on which we are operating is unique within the realm of light therapy.\n\nDosage and dosage on wavelength:The specific dosages of 0.18 mW/cm2, and 30 mW/cm2, up to 50 mW/cm2 on the 630 \u00b1 5 nm wavelength have not been mentioned in previous art.

There is also the option to use programmable temperature control to heat or cool the treatment site to establish conditions for optimal DNA repair and synthesis.\n\n### State Of Development\n\nThe invention is currently in the working prototype stage.

The chemical composition and bulk crystal structures can be recovered from this regeneration process. With the successful revival of their composition and structure, the Li storage capacity, cycling stability and rate capability of the degraded cathode particles can be recovered to the original levels of the pristine materials.Lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs) are currently the dominant power sources for portable electronics and electric vehicles, both of which have rapidly growing markets.

Great effort has been made to recycle LIB cathode materials. State\u2010of\u2010the-art approaches include pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and direct recycling. The pyrometallurgical approach requires high temperature smelting as well as multi-step purification and separation processes; the hydrometallurgical approach requires acid leaching and subsequent complicated precipitation steps to produce precursors for the re-synthesis of new cathode materials. Both approaches have to totally destroy the LIB cathode particles which represent a significant amount of value from their primary manufacturing process. The direct recycling approach combines physical separation to harvest the cathode materials with high-pressure relithiation to regenerate cathode materials, where the high pressure process greatly increases the cost of regeneration.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease with limited treatment options and a high mortality rate. Pancreatic cancer is the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in the United States; despite some recent advances in systemic therapy, survival remains dismal in large part due to its profound drug resistance and its propensity for early metastasis. Typically, diagnosis of pancreatic cancer occurs only with advanced stages of the disease since there are currently no early markers for detection. Individuals with pancreatic cancer have a poor prognosis due to the late diagnosis, the extent of metastasis, and ineffective treatments. Survival rates are dismal, with a one-year survival rate of 25% and a 5-year survival rate of 6%. Currently, approximately 20% of pancreatic cancer patients are able to undergo the Whipple procedure; this surgical procedure involves removal of the affected portion of the pancreas, leading to an increased survival rate. However, the remaining 80% of pancreatic cancer patients cannot undergo this treatment because their tumors or the extent of metastasis are too severe. In addition, pancreatic cancer is not typically responsive to radiation and chemotherapy. An alternative approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer is a complete pancreatectomy followed by continual supplementation with digestive enzymes and insulin. Thus, more effective drugs are needed to increase the survival rate of pancreatic cancer patients. Targeting ROR\u03b3 may lead to the design of a new class of therapeutics that can be used to treat this devastating disease.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have identified a novel function for the nuclear hormone receptor ROR\u03b3 in pancreatic cancer for the first time, and show that this molecule is essential for pancreatic cancer initiation and progression. The investigations conclude that ROR\u03b3 represents a new molecule that can be targeted to treat pancreatic cancer via an inhibitor to ROR\u03b3.\n\nThe primary application is the administration of the Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan 5 receptor gamma (ROR\u03b3) inhibitor to a human subject. This invention could lead to the development of effective drugs against pancreatic cancer and diagnostic and prognostic kits for these diseases.\n\nThese studies identify ROR\u03b3 as a central regulator of pancreatic cancer initiation and progression and suggest that targeting of ROR\u03b3 could be a new approach to cancer therapy.\n\nThis invention is in the experimental data stage. Researchers have shown that loss of ROR\u03b3 impairs tumor propagation in mouse models of pancreatic cancer as well as blocking growth in human cancer cells.",

    "ip_description": "Anthrax disease, caused by Bacillus anthracis, is a highly lethal infection with patient fatality rate between 45-85% during fulminant, toxemia-related late-stages of infection. Systemic release of anthrax edema toxin during late-stage infection induces vascular collapse through endothelial barrier disruption, culminating in fatal hypovolemic shock, a hallmark of systemic anthrax infection. Existing therapeutic strategies to mitigate the effects of anthrax infections only target early-stage infection vis-\u00e0-vis bacterial clearance (antibiotics) and toxin-host cell interactions (anti-toxin antibodies), but are ineffective in preventing toxemic-shock which is induced even after pathogen clearance. In fact, patients with fulminant infection require aggressive, continuous fluid drainage and assisted breathing, and no effective therapeutic interventions exist currently for this critical stage of infection. Pathogen induced cell-cell barrier disruption (anthrax, cholera, traveler\u2019s diarrhea, gastroenteritis, pertussis, pneumonia) account for significant socio-economic impacts each year. Stand-alone antitoxin therapies such as those mentioned here can fulfill the unmet medical need for measures that significantly improve the survival rate of patients with severe infections, and lower the risk for development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nHigh fatality rate of anthrax infections, despite intense antibiotic and supportive therapies, are primarily due to the continuing activities of anthrax exotoxins (ET and LT) released in the patient's circulatory system. Edema toxin or ET, a highly active adenylate cyclase that induces uncontrolled, pathological elevation in cellular levels of the second messenger cAMP is a major virulence protein of Bacillus anthracis and mediates significant lethality during fulminant stages of infection. ET induces rapid disruption of the endothelial barrier, resulting in irreversible tissue damage and lethality due massive fluid loss resulting in cardiovascular collapse and hypovolemic shock. It is therefore imperative that new therapeutic measures be developed that effectively blocks the intracellular function of ET (i.e. cellular proteins/pathways co-opted to induce barrier instability), to reduce fatalities associated with anthrax toxemia.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have an invention and method that provides a treatment wherein the condition is caused by anthrax, cholera, traveler\u2019s diarrhea, gastroenteritis, pertussis, or pneumonia.\n\nThe application would include the administration of an inhibitor(s) which would treat the cell-cell barrier disruption-associated condition.\n\n_In vivo_ experiments have been conducted in mice.",

    "ip_description": "Currently, alleles at multiple loci in the mouse genome must be combined by Mendelian genetics in crosses of animals to one another to produce a desired compound mutant genotype. For example, to combine homozygous mutations at two loci, animals that are heterozygous for each gene must be produced by breeding, and these are subsequently crossed to one another. Since the frequency of homozygosity for each allele is 1:4 the frequency of homozygosity for both genes is 1:16. Since the average litter of mice is approximately 10 pups, and the generation time from conception to reproductive age is about 3 months, this requires a substantial number of animals and time. With the addition of each new locus (three, four, etc), the cost measured in animals, time, and money increases exponentially. These factors increase substantially more if two or more loci are genetically linked, which requires rare recombination events to combine engineered alleles on the same chromosome.\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive system stands to revolutionize rodent breeding. If each desired allele is encoded as a gene drive element that contains an sgRNA designed to target the same genomic location in the wild type homologous chromosome, each locus will be \u201cdriven\u201d to homozygosity in the presence of Cas9. Therefore, in order to combine three alleles, for example, a mouse with one gene drive element (A) would be crossed to a mouse that encodes Cas9. Offspring of this cross would then be crossed to mice carrying gene drive element B, and these offspring would be crossed to mice carrying gene drive element C. In the presence of Cas9 at each generation, these gene drive elements at three distinct loci will be converted to homozygosity such that 50% of offspring, those that inherit Cas9, will be triple homozygous after three generations, even if they are genetically linked loci.\nA CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene drive leverages the native cellular mechanism of homology directed repair to copy a desired allele from one chromosome to another. This process can convert a heterozygous genotype to homozygosity in a single generation. While CRISPR-Cas9 gene drives have been implemented in two species of insects, flies and mosquitos, it has not been reported in any non-insect animal species. \nResearchers at UC San Diego have a developed a method to use CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive in rodents, notably mice and rats that are research and commercial models of human physiology and disease.  \nA CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene drive is a method that leverages the native cellular mechanism of homology directed repair to copy a desired allele from one chromosome to another. This process can convert a heterozygous genotype to homozygosity in a single generation. \nOnce the efficiency is optimized in mouse models using our reporter animal, the method can be implemented in a wide variety of applications to model disease, test drug efficacy and metabolism, and potentially to control wild rodent populations.\nThe invention is at the experimental data stage, although proof of concept has been completed.",

When sliding-window coded modulation (SWCM) is used however, the performance metrics depend on those of interfering devices in neighboring cells, and hence scheduling has to be performed simultaneously over multiple cells.A method for performing scheduling by a first base station over a wireless communication network, and an apparatus therefor are provided. The method includes receiving first channel status information (CSI) measured by a user equipment (UE) positioned in coverage of the first base station and second CSI, determining a first transmission rate for any one of the at least one UE positioned in the coverage of the first base station and a second transmission rate for any one of the at least one UE positioned in the coverage of the second base station, determining a third transmission rate for a first UE among the at least one UE positioned in the coverage of the first base station and a fourth transmission rate for a second UE among the at least one UE positioned in the coverage of the second base station, and performing scheduling.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UC San Diego in collaboration with engineers from Samsung Electronics have patented a method for communicating with users positioned in a cell edge where performance is degraded due to interference from an adjacent cell in a cellular communication environment, and provides a method and an apparatus capable of applying a sliding-window superposition coding (SWSC) information theory scheme to a wireless cellular environment.  This invention relates to a pre- 5th-Generation (5G) or 5G communication system to be provided for supporting higher data rates beyond 4th-Generation (4G) communication system such as Long Term Evolution (LTE). A performance of the existing sliding-window superposition coding (SWSC) is degraded when a wireless channel state is changed due to a large scale fading and a small scale fading. In addition, the performance of the existing SWSC is degraded when channel state information at a receiver is different from that of the real channel. \n\nAdaptive SWCM can be used for interference management in downlink and/or uplink scenarios for cellular networks.\n\nMore specifically, this technology provides a sliding-window coded modulation in cellular networks, which consists of successive cancellation with soft information and sliding-window iterative decoding on the receiver side; and multiple layers for both sender, adaptive bit mapping, and power allocation parameters on the sender side. It also proposes cellular operations for SWCM such as frame structure, resource allocation for the 3GPP LTE standard, signaling between base stations and user equipment, and the cooperation of the base stations.",

The modulation rate of LEDs is however poised to grow in importance due to the need to couple information processing with illumination.

Studies suggest that PBDEs pose potential health risks such as hormone disruptors, adverse neurobehavioral toxins and reproductive or developmental effects.  For this reason it is important to have the capability to sense the presence of PBDEs even in low concentrations.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have Invented a highly sensitive nanostructured thin-film detector capable of identifying low concentrations (nano-molar) of Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in aqueous solution.

    "ip_description": "Hyperbolic metasurfaces (HMS) merge the exotic properties of hyperbolic metamaterials with the potential for lower losses and better device coupling offered by planar metasurfaces. Despite use of single-crystalline silver (Ag), HMS remain inherently lossy, limiting potential applications. Recent work has suggested that Ag could be combined with indium gallium arsenide phosphide (InGaAsP) multiple quantum wells (MQW) to enable transparent propagation of signals through waveguides and multilayers. Described here is the first experimental demonstration of a luminescent HMS (LuHMS) based on nanostructured (NS) Ag/InGaAsP MQW.  Researchers at UC San Diego have an invention, whereby the wavelength range in which the composite material exhibits hyperbolic dispersion, absorption and emission of radiation overlap, thereby earning the name LuHMS. The LuHMS works in conjunction with an external light source, heretofore called the \"pump.\" Upon excitation by the pump, the LuHMS absorbs photons, creating electron-hole pairs. The amount of electron-hole pairs generated for a fixed pump intensity depends strongly on the polarization state of the normally incident pump beam, with maximum carriers generated for pump polarization parallel to the optical axis. Similarly, for fixed pump polarization, the amount of carriers generated increases with the intensity of the pump beam. The electron-hole pairs recombine to form photons of lesser energy than the pump photons, which are emitted from the LuHMS. The polarization of the collected photons is predominantly parallel to the optical axis, despite the fact that the polarization of collected photons from the bare InGaAsP MQW is more polarized in the orthogonal direction. When driven by an external optical pump at 1064nm, the HMS emit broadband radiation in the 1200nm-1600nm spectral range. Extreme anisotropy of total emission with respect to the pump polarization is observed, with peak PL differing by more than an order of magnitude for orthogonal pump polarization states. Additionally, we measure degree-of-linear-polarization of the emission as high as 0.9.  Compared to existing hyperbolic metamaterials (HMM), the LuHMS is the only HMM wherein the constituent dielectric is a light emitting material. Other HMMs have incorporated light emitting molecules or quantum dots in addition to their constituent metallic and dielectric components. The LuHMS consists of only 1 metallic and 1 dielectric component, the latter also being the light emitting component. Additionally, the optical (unique) axis of the LuHMS lies in the plane of the electric field vector of a normally incident pump beam. By contrast, the optical axis of all other HMMs that have incorporated light emitting molecules or quantum dots is parallel to the direction of propagation of a normally incident pump beam. The invention can be used as an integrated polarization sensor, a polarized light emitting diode or as an absorption modulator. The unique architecture of the LuHMS enables extreme polarization anisotropy of a normally incident pump beam, which is not possible in other HMMs that incorporate light emitters. Patent pending with device and circuit-level applications of the active HMS demonstrated.",

    "ip_description": "The number one cause of train derailments globally are unidentified track defects which accumulate over time under the heavy loads and weathering to which rail is exposed. For the last 100 years rail inspection has sought to identify these structural defects before they can pose a serious threat to regular rail traffic. Unfortunately, rail inspection has required specialized low-speed testing cars which can only operate at less than 25% the normal speed of a train. These inspection cars must coordinate their work around planned outages of the rail line, impacting normal rail traffic. Due to this inconvenience, rail defects are typically repaired in real-time, as identified, vs. being prioritized as to potential seriousness and repaired in order of likelihood to cause a future accident.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed a passive-acoustic rail inspection system which can assess rail health at train speeds, enabling ordinary locomotives and/or passenger/cargo cars to gather information on rail integrity as they operate their normal routes. The passive-acoustic system captures reflected acoustic noise that is native in the wheel/rail interface and interprets changes in the received acoustic profile to categorize developing defects which could further develop into potential hazards. Through real-time rail-health acquisition, a comprehensive assessment of all active rail-lines is now possible, enabling the broad prioritization of rail-repairs in order of their severity and likelihood of causing a near term accident.\n\nThis technology is applicable to all passenger and heavy cargo rail lines subject to regular defect inspection.\n\nThis technology enables real-time train-speed inspection of rail health and the development of a comprehensive rail maintenance program driven by a greatest-risk/ first-fixed paradigm.   This is a dramatic shift away from the present first-found/ first-fixed approach, which can clearly leave maintenance resources pre-occupied with lesser threat repairs.\nA working prototype of the invention has been created and tested at the National Rail Research Center in Colorado. A local prototype is also available for demonstration.",

Neural signal acquisition ICs have conventionally been designed composed of two distinct functional blocks per recording channel: a low-noise amplifier front-end (AFE), and an analog-digital converter (ADC).  Hybrid architectures utilizing oversampling ADCs with digital feedback have seen recent adoption due to their increased power and area efficiency. However, input dynamic range (DR) is still relatively limited due to aggressive supply voltage scaling and/or capacitive sampling noise. \n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have an invention that represents the first neural recording ADC chip with 92dB dynamic range and 0.99\u00b5Vrms of noise at 0.8\u00b5W power consumption per channel over 500Hz signal bandwidth, owing to:  \n\na predictive digital autoranging (PDA) scheme in a hybrid analog-digital second-order oversampling ADC architecture; and  \n\nno specific sampling process through capacitors, avoiding kT/C noise altogether. \n\nBy digitally predicting the analog input at 12-bit resolution from a single-bit quantization of the continuously integrated residue at an effective 32 oversampling ratio (OSR), the PDA handles a \u00b1130mV electrode differential offset (EDO) and recovers from >200mVpp transient artifacts within <1ms.

    "ip_description": "Piezoelectric sensors have long existed to monitor applied pressures between two objects. In large applications with malleable substrates or where low cost is key, individual piezoelectric sensors are not practical. A variety of applications exist where monitoring the pressure being applied to a soft surface would providing meaningful insights into the system or subject under observation. For instance, in a long-term care setting where patients need to be monitored for pressure ulcers, a bedding material that could sense the pressure points between a person\u2019s body and the mattress could alert care givers that an adjustment in body position is warranted. Likewise, in a sports training application, a pressure sensitive boxing ring canvas could track a boxer\u2019s footwork, or punching power and hand speed if applied to the inside of a punching bag.   Pressure sensitive soft toys could also benefit from feedback that might differ when a child scratches behind their stuffed animal\u2019s ears vs. rubbing its belly.  To achieve discrete sensing in these applications, a low cost bulk sensing system is needed.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed a bulk process to render any ordinary fabric conductive by applying a nanotube enriched paint along the back surface of the fabric to be sensed. Next, using conductive thread, low cost leads are attached along the perimeter of the fabric, in effect realizing a pixel grid across the entire fabric surface. The fabric is then biased with a low voltage and as incident pressures are applied, the conductivity of the nanotube enriched paint changes in a localized fashion. The change in the read out voltages from the perimeter electrodes is measured and rendered visually as a pressure position and intensity reading. Prototypes developed to date have very low latency and great sensitivity, enabling many low cost applications for this technology.\n\nThis invention has the potential for broad use in large scale and/or distributed pressure sensing applications. For healthcare, pressure sensing bed linens and wheelchair seats are readily made which can monitor for blood-flow occlusion which could lead to pressure ulcers (bed sores). In retail products, the technology could find ready application to sporting goods with pressure (force) based feedback and toy applications.\n\nThis invention removes the need to apply discrete piezoelectric sensors by enabling the entire surface to act as a pressure sensor with discrete localization of applied pressures. This invention also works on pliable/soft surfaces with limited support, an application unsuited for piezoelectric sensors.\nWorking prototype \nPatent pending and available for licensing.",

    "ip_description": "Teleoperation brings the advantage of remote control and manipulation to distant locations or harsh or constrained environments. The system allows operators to send commands from a remote console, traditionally called a master device, to a robot, traditionally called a slave device, and offers synchronization of movements. This allows the remote user to operate as if on-site, making teleoperational systems an ideal and often only solution to a wide range of applications such as underwater exploration, space robotics, mobile robots, and telesurgery.\n\nThe main technical challenge in realizing remote telesurgery (and similarly, all remote teleoperation) is the latency from the communication distance between the master and slave. This delay causes overshoot and oscillations in the commanded positions, and are observable and statistically significant in as little as 50msec of round trip communication delay.\n\nPredictive displays are virtual reality renderings, generally designed for space operations, that show a prediction of the events to follow in a short amount of time. It can be used to overcome the negative effects of delay by giving the operator immediate feedback from a predicted environment. Furthermore, it does not suffer stability issues that arise with delayed haptic feedback. Early predictive displays included manipulation of the Engineering Test Satellite 7 from ground control where the round trip delay can be up to 7sec and Augmented Reality (AR) rendering where the prediction is overlaid on raw image data. These strategies can be applied to telesurgery, but require overcoming the unique challenges in calculating and tracking the 3D environment for a full environment prediction, which includes non-rigid material such as tissue. Furthermore, prior work in the surgical robotics community highlights the need for active tracking rather than only relying on kinematic calibrations to localize the slave due to the millimeter scale of a surgical operation and the often utilized cable driven actuation.\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego present a complete system, and show through a user study that the result is an efficient AR rendering architecture for streaming stereoscopic displays. They call this a Stereoscopic AR Predictive Display (SARPD). We show that over 30fps for the stereoscopic AR rendering, including lens matching, and 24Hz for the slave-tool tracking from the EKF can be achieved while running simultaneously on a commodity GPU and using the robot operating system (ROS). A user study is carried out to demonstrate its ability to improve the speed of procedures without affecting error rates. Beyond telesurgery, this solution can be deployed to any teleoperated robot with visual feedback once calibrated. Furthermore, it does not require stereo cameras or displays since the real-time slave-tool tracking is done on a single monocular camera data stream.\n\nThere are many potential applications for augmented reality in robotic surgery, both in 'traditional' robotic surgery (non-remote telesurgery), and in remote telesurgery (tele robotics). This technology specifically applies to the potential for remote tele robotic surgery which could open up a wide field of remote telerobotic surgery in the military and civilian arenas.\n\nBoth prior works and the conducted user study on this system highlight the advantages when utilizing a predictive display for teleoperating under delay. The current findings show SARPD is decreases the time to complete tasks when operating under delay. Reduction of time for operations is critical for patient safety. Furthermore, the AR rendering allows for additional overlays to provide the surgeon additional information during an operation such as highlighting a region and critical patient information.\n\nThe architecture for SARPD is complete, and the AR rendering procedure has been optimized by utilizing an OpenGL rendering procedure on GPU. Additional overlay renderings can be easily implemented into the current framework. In addition to using different 3D models to render the prediction, the tool tracking portion of the system can be interchanged with other methods to support different teleoperated robotic systems. While the user study that was conducted shows the importance of SARPD, further studies need to be done for both ex vivo and in vivo.",

This can be accomplished with or without cells or primary tissue fragments encapsulated within the matrix, and with or without cells lining the interior of the lumens. The presence of the biocompatible matrix allows for growth and sustenance of encapsulated of cells or excised tissue fragments in an environment that mimics native extracellular matrix conditions, while the lumenal patterns allow for perfusion and sustenance of the system with growth media or biomolecules in a manner that scales with the specific patterns being used.\n\nSpecifically, the invention allows for construction of a solid but evacuable free-standing structure thatcan take the form of various 2D or 3D printed geometries including linear channels, sinusoids, grids,and spirals among others. This free-standing structure can subsequently be surrounded by a cell encapsulating solution of biological matrix or matrix-substitute such as Matrigel, gelatin, collagen, fibrin, or a blend of any of the aforementioned. Following enclosure in an aqueous matrix solution, the matrix solution is permitted to gelate to create a cellularized matrix, ultimately with the ability to form a hollow channel.\u00a0Perfusion of the matrix through the evacuated vascular channels allows for both the design and sustenance of and growth of the cells within thick, tissue constructs for period exceeding 30 days.\n\nThe application of the technology is for tissue engineering with broad applications which can generate biologically derived tissue constructs containing vascular channels of complex 3D geometries via 3D printing of poly(vinyl alcohol).\u00a0For example, in the context of cell culture, it can be used primarily as a matrix component to form porous, cell-laden hydrogels, or to form biocompatible hydrogels via stereolithography.\u00a0The methodology is both highly simple and easily reproducible, making it accessible in many research settings.\n\nThis invention offers of number of superior attributes not available to what is currently available. First, the variety of evacuable geometries (for producing vascular or lumenal patterns) that can be generated by this technique is far greater than the combined total of all the methodologies described, thereby allowing us to generate a much greater variety of structures for 3D culture. Second, the technique is highly democratic, and requires nothing more than a commercial 3D printer along with the raw materials needed for the desired extracellular matrix and cell cultures.\n\nValidated 3D printing approach to generate tissue vasculature with encapsulated cells.\u00a0we developed an engineered tissue model that contained a vascular channel seeded with primary endothelial cells, and was capable of sustaining both cells and tissue fragments long-term.The inventors demonstrated the viability of creating co-cultures of Caco-2 gut epithelial cells with primary endothelial cells that mimicked in vivo gut-like organization patterns.",

This invention leverages the ability to monitor the deformation of the side walls caused by the analyte passing through the channel. Critically, the analyte did not have to make contact with the channel walls to induce a deflection. This minute deformation was transduced into a change in electrical resistance using an ultrasensitive piezoresitive film composed of metallic nano-islands on graphene.\n\nUsing this technology UCSD nanoengineers could demonstrate that the deformation of the sidewalls in a microfluidic channel may be used to measure a variety of phenomenon, such as the fluid flow rates, the viscoelastic relaxation of the channel side walls in the presence of air bubbles, and channel deformation caused by particles and cells. \nThis technology can be incorporated into many existing flow systems, such as flow cytometry and allow the measurement of cellular properties that are not possible with flow cytometric analysis using fluorochrome conjugated antibodies.

The invention is useful by detecting the bile acid conjugates levels we can assess disease severity and type of disease. The current stage of development is in the experimental data stage. A mosaic of cross-phyla chemical interactions occurs between all metazoans and their microbiomes. In humans, the gut harbors the heaviest microbial load, but many organs, particularly those with a mucosal surface, associate with highly adapted and evolved microbial consortia.

That is, what was the actual origin of a molecule that has been found in nature based on the mass spectrum for that molecule, without having to identify the molecule itself, and optionally, to model an entire sample based on the contexts of its constituent molecules This could be an animal product, food, personal care products, medication formulations, building materials, etc. \n\nThis invention can be used in the agricultural industry to determine sources of contamination. In drug discovery, it can be used to find high productivity sources of scarce but highly desirable molecules. In medicine, the source of a harmful or irritant can be determined in order to improve health.\n\nPrior inventions relied on the molecules' structure having previously been identified. This structural information could then rely on external structure databases to track the source.\u00a0However, this invention does not rely on the knowledge of structure and can be done purely from the data and spectral matching.\n\nThis invention is at the working prototype stage.

    "ip_description": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. The primary prevention of CVD is dependent upon the ability to identify high-risk individuals long before the development of overt events. This highlights the need for accurate risk stratification. An increasing number of novel biomarkers have been identified to predict cardiovascular events. Biomarkers play a critical role in the definition, prognostication, and decision-making regarding the management of cardiovascular events. There are several promising biomarkers that might provide diagnostic and prognostic information. The myocardial tissue-specific biomarker cardiac troponin, high-sensitivity assays for cardiac troponin, and heart-type fatty acid binding potential help diagnose myocardial infarction (MI) in the early hours following symptoms. Inflammatory markers such as growth differentiation factor-15, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and uric acid predict MI and death and many others. However, there is a high unmet medical need for the more specific biomarkers that reflect different aspects of the development of atherosclerosis.\n\nAtherosclerosis is associated with increased lipid peroxidation, leading to generation of multiple oxidation- specific epitopes (OSEs), contributing to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its clinical manifestation. Oxidized cholesteryl esters (OxCEs) are a major class of OSEs found in human plasma and atherosclerotic tissue.  \nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) to oxidized cholesteryl esters (OxCE). OxCE is a type of neo-epitope, which arise during the development of atherosclerosis, the underlying disease manifesting in heart attack or stroke. It belongs to the family of oxidation-specific epitopes (OSE), and it is involved in TLR4-mediated proinflammatory signaling. \nThe inventors optimized an assay where this mAb is used for measuring OxCE in apoB-100 and apoAI lipoproteins. In addition, there is the potential for molecular imaging and therapeutic applications of the new mAb and/or its derivatives in detecting and neutralizing proinflammatory and atherogenic OxCE epitopes. \nBiomarkers to OxCE epitopes might be a good complement to oxidized phospholipid (OxPL). They have different distribution in plasma lipoproteins and could provide enhanced risk discrimination in addition to currently measured clinical variables. (Anti-OxPL antibody is being validated in the clinic and it also has the promising therapeutic potential.)\n\nSince OxCE is a target for diagnostic biomarkers and a therapeutic target, the invention is or will be used for a novel biomarker immunoassay and molecular imaging. \n\nOxPL has been shown to be a major biomarker for CVD and the anti-OxPL antibody has a robust therapeutic potential. Our data show that OxCE and OxPL levels in plasma do not correlate, suggesting that OxCE is an independent biomarker. \n\nExperimental data and a working prototype of a biomarker assay.",

    "ip_description": "Point-of-care (POC) testing is essential to halt the spread of deadly infectious diseases (e.g., Ebola, Zika, etc.) and is needed for rapid and accurate screening both in and outside of clinical settings. Label-free bioassays are desirable for POC testing as they have fewer reagents and assay steps resulting in lower cost and ease of use.   Biosensors based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), an ultra-sensitive, label-free sensing technique, are a promising technology for precise and rapid disease diagnosis at the point-of-care. However, EIS usually requires mixers and lock-in detection to measure both the magnitude and phase of the complex impedance. \n\nResearchers from UC San Diego have patented a novel field deployable 16\u00d720 biosensor array for highly scalable label-free point-of-care applications, such as nucleic acid testing. The on-chip sensors use a streamlined and highly scalable polar modulation method to monitor bioassay events.  Using the polar-mode measurement technique, label-free detection of DNA hybridization was measured with the designed array demonstrating promise for precise and highly scalable biosensing in POC applications. Hsu et al (2018) demonstrated the use of this invention to measure hybridization of Zika virus oligonucleotides.\n\nIn-pixel circuitry (140\u00d7140 \u00b5m2) provides for the measurement of the necessary phase changes of the on-chip sensors using a trans-impedance amplifier, zero-crossing detector, and a first-order noise-shaping time-to-digital converter without the need for quadrature signal analysis.  Implemented in a 0.18 \u03bcm process, the 3\u00d74 mm2 chip achieves state-of-the-art performance with an rms phase error of 0.04% at 50 kHz. This work provides full integration of in-pixel electrode and meausurement circuitry for precise and highly scalable biosensing in Point-of-care applications\n\nThe unique architecture enables in-pixel digitization and accumulation, which increases the SNR by 10 dB for each 10\u00d7 increase in readout time\n\nMeasured electric and biological data from silicon",

    "ip_description": "Kainic acid is a chemical first derived from seaweed. Neuroscientists routinely use Kainic acid to simulate brain degeneration in lab experiments. Certain inotropic receptors in the brain--known as kainate receptors--are selectively activated only by kainic acid. Research into kainate receptors helps researchers to understand Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and other brain disorders. Some scientists use kainic acid to find answers to more fundamental questions such as the function of glutamate receptors.\nCurrently, there are two procedures for generating kainic acid commercially. The first involves the farming and collection of kainic acid-containing seaweed and that method is impacted by seasonal fluctuations of seaweed growth and kainic acid production. The second involves synthetic processes, but the current procedures generally require at least 6 synthetic steps with yields less than 40% and generate environmentally toxic byproducts including heavy metals, cyanides, or halogenated organics. \n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed a novel bio-based approach to produce kainic acid involving the first use of biocatalysis and biotransformation. The researchers discovered two genes from seaweeds and showed in the laboratory that the encoded enzymes can be used to produce kainic acid in a very efficient manner. The inventors developed several complementary methods using a combination of enzymes, chemical synthesis, and bacterial fermentation to produce kainic acid at the gram-scale level.  \nFurthermore, this technology is scalable and economical, requiring reagents that cost less than 10% of reagents found in other current kainic acid syntheses, while also offering a simplified purification procedure.\n\nThis work firmly establishes a cost-effective and atom-economy approach to prepare the commercially important neurochemical kainic acid.\n\nThis bio-based technology is fast, efficient, green and scalable, positioning it as the superior choice for supplying kainic acid and derivatives for commercial markets.\n\nThe inventors have reduced to practice the 2-step, scalable production of kainic acid at the gram-scale. This biotransformation procedure is convenient and results in an efficient production of kainic acid that can be purified in an effective process involving charcoal filtration and C18 reversed phase liquid chromatography to yield a product in 99% purity. This process sets the stage for an even larger production and with engineered KabC enzyme and engineered production host to achieve even higher yields at large scale.",

    "ip_description": "Vedolizumab (VDZ) is an effective therapy for the management of patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) who have failed conventional therapy with aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and thiopurines, as well as biologic therapy with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. Several studies have identified potential predictors of treatment outcomes; however, the optimal approach to integrating predictors into routine practice is uncertain.\n\nNo prior decision support tools exist to predict VDZ drug exposure in UC and CD and link this back to differences in effectiveness or response to VDZ dose escalation. By having a tool that can predict at baseline prior to start of therapy whether VDZ will be effective and what a patients drug exposure profile will be with VDZ, the provider can 1) determine if VDZ is an appropriate therapy to begin, 2) proactively monitor those patients deemed high risk for treatment failure with VDZ, and 3) proactively measure drug concentrations for VDZ to then increase the dose or the interval at which VDZ is administered to improve outcomes.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have addressed this gap by deriving multivariable logistic regression prediction models and clinical design support tools (CDST) using the GEMINI clinical trial data sets for the outcomes of corticosteroid-free clinical and endoscopic remission. The correlation between variability in VDZ exposure and differences in efficacy across predicted probability groups was explored in the derivation set, and the CDST was subsequently validated in an external cohort of UC and CD patients treated with VDZ in routine practice. The intent was to create a CDST that will help clinicians optimize VDZ therapy for individual patients.\n\nThe models give a score and thus predicts how an UC or CD patient will respond to VDZ, how quickly they will respond, and it predicts what the individual patient\u2019s drug exposure profile will be during therapy and whether they would benefit from VDZ dose or interval changes.\n\nThe scores put the patients into a high, intermediate, or low probability of response to VDZ category.\u00a0Patients in the high probability group are predicted to have higher drug exposure and can be monitored less frequently with no drug concentration testing. Patients in the intermediate or low probability group will have incrementally lower drug exposure and efficacy. In these patients providers can have the patient return for follow-up sooner, check drug concentrations, and increase the dose of VDZ or the interval of VDZ administration until they achieve a concentration consistent with the concentrations achieved in the high probability of response group.\n\nThe models performance in clinical practice was confirmed through an external validation in a large multi-center cohort of VDZ treated UC and CD patients.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC San Diego have developed a novel method to identify ASD biomarkers. Traditionally, biomarkers are identified based on the expression patterns of differentially expressed genes and such methods rely on univariate aspects of genes (i.e., their fold change compared to normal controls). The current invention relies on a method that goes beyond that and considers the bivariate changes between genes. This methodology provides more robust signals that can be used as the disease signature. Specifically, our framework identifies dysregulated gene networks in the disease condition. Such network combines information on observed gene expression patterns with current state of knowledge on gene regulatory mechanisms, signaling pathways, and protein interactions. Next, it measures the activity level of the dysregulated network in different individuals based on the co-expression pattern of interacting genes in the network. The observed network activity levels correlate well with the clinically measured severity level of the complex diseases such as autism and develops an ASD signature.  This was achieved by analyzing the peripheral blood of living ASD individuals at very young ages and examining the transcriptomic data from leukocytes, stems cell models, and the developing brain to study the underlying architecture of transcriptional dysregulation in ASD, its connection to rASD genes, and its association with prenatal development and clinical outcomes of ASD toddlers. Specifically, we discovered a conserved dysregulated gene network by analyzing leukocyte transcriptomic data from 1-4 years old ASD and typically developing (TD) toddlers. The dysregulated network is enriched for pathways known to be perturbed in ASD neurons, impacts highly expressed processes in prenatal brain development, and is dysregulated in iPS cell-derived neurons from ASD cases. This is the first signature that correlates with the clinical severity of autistic individuals. Such signature has the promise for early diagnosis, prognosis and classification of autistic individuals at early ages.\n\nThe current invention is a signature for autism spectrum disorder. The developed framework works on the transcriptome data. For autism diagnosis, prognosis, and classification, our framework needs access to blood transcriptome data from autistic and normal control individuals.\n\nThe invention can be used for the biomarker development for diagnosis and prognosis of any complex disease and disorder.\n\nWe have experimental data from 240 male toddlers that support the functionality of the developed signature.",

Based on this concept and rationale, one can systematically search for reagents or specific molecular targets that can lead to maximal activation of innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune activities. \n\nApplications\nThe reagents would be used to treat liver cancer\nAdvantages\n\nThe combination therapy is more effective than treatment by single reagents.\n\nState Of Development\n\nThe current work has been carried out on several animal models as well as in induced liver tumors in mice which demonstrate potent tumor-inhibitory effects and should be beneficial for designing successful clinical trials.",

    "ip_description": "MBI and BSGI utilize \u03b3-cameras in a mammographic configuration to provide functional images of the breast. Several studies have confirmed that MBI has a high sensitivity for the detection of small breast lesions, independent of tumor type. A large clinical trial compared MBI with screening mammography in over 1000 women with mammographically dense breast tissue and increased risk of breast cancer and showed that MBI detected two to three times more cancers than mammography. Despite these favorable results, BSGI and MBI have not been widely accepted for breast cancer screening due to greater effective radiation dose compared with mammography. Another disadvantage of MBI is long imaging time, causing discomfort to the patient. Furthermore, while digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) produces 3D images, resulting in improved cancer detection over mammography, current clinical MBI and BSGI systems produce only 2D images. These disadvantages are due to the use of parallel hole collimator (PHC) with MBI and BSGI, which is inefficient, allowing only gamma rays traveling perpendicular to the detector to be recorded. Furthermore, PHA cannot produce a 3D image with a stationary detector and results in a loss of image resolution with increasing distance between the tumor and the gamma detector.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed a compressive sensing absorber (CSA) for Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) and Breast Specific Gamma Imaging (BSGI) that will greatly increase scanner efficiency, decrease image acquisition time and allow for ultra-low-dose, high-resolution 2D and 3D molecular breast imaging. The invention uses a novel collimator containing a random pattern of attenuation that allows for detection of many more photons, thus greatly increasing sensitivity, and a compressive sensing reconstruction algorithm which, in combination with the hardware, allows for 3D imaging with a stationary camera head - no moving parts. The invention has a working prototype that has demonstrated the feasibility of image acquisition and reconstruction of a phantom using CSA on MBI gamma camera. The CSA is envisioned as a replacement for the inefficient parallel hole collimator (PHC) on current MBI and BSGI systems.\n\nApplications\n\nDetection of primary and metastatic breast cancer using an existing Molecular Breast Imaging camera.\n\nAdvantages\n\nGreatly increased sensitivity and 3D Molecular Breast Imaging with a novel collimator hardware and image reconstruction algorithm compared to current commercial systems that are 2D, have low sensitivity requiring high radiation dose and do not use image reconstruction.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC San Diego invented a better technique for the evaluation of OP. The technique uses ultrashort echo time magnetization transfer (UTE-MT) imaging and signal modeling to quantify the different proton groups, including free water, bound water and macromolecule protons in short T2 tissues such as the menisci, ligaments, tendons and cortical bone. UTE-MT images with a series of MT frequency offsets and MT power are subject to MT modeling to generate maps of T1s, T2s, proton fractions and exchange rates of bound water, free water and macromolecules in short T2 tissues. The techniques allow for the quantification of T1s, T2s, fractions and exchange rates of bound water, free water and collagen protons in cortical bone. Free water fraction can be used to evaluate cortical porosity, while bound water fraction and especially collagen proton fraction can be used to evaluate organic matrix density. Maps of T1s, T2s, exchange rates and fractions are likely to provide much more comprehensive assessment of bone quality and quantity than current gold standard technique, DEXA as well as CT techniques. \n\nThe potential commercial applications of the UTE-MT imaging and modeling techniques include the evaluation of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis (OA), and tendon diseases. In all cases, the invention allows for the measurement of new biomarkers not available with previous techniques. This is likely to increase the accuracy in predicting bone properties, and improvement of monitoring. \n\nThe techniques proposed in this invention allow OA evaluation in a more systematic way, i.e., focusing not only on the long T2 component of articular cartilage but the short T2 component of this tissue and other short T2 tissues including their bound and free water components as well as macromolecule protons. Biomarkers such as fractions and exchange rates of bound water, free water and macromolecule protons are magic angle insensitive.

Therefore, the proposed technique is likely to provide new biomarkers that are more sensitive to early stages of joint degeneration characterized by disruption of collagen, loss of proteoglycans (PG) and increase in water content.\n\nThe researchers are working on a prototype stage for UTE-MT modeling",

The two treatments currently approved for cyanide poisoning\u2014 hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit) and the combination of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate (Nithiodote)\u2014must be administered by intravenous injection. Thus, no agent currently exists for rapidly treating a large number of cyanide poisoned persons. Another rapidly acting poison similar to cyanide, is hydrogen sulfide.\u00a0People are exposed to hydrogen sulfide gas in a variety of occupations, most notably wastewater processing, and agriculture and petroleum industries. Up to 30% of oil workers have been exposed to sufficient amounts of hydrogen sulfide to have symptoms, and fatalities are not uncommon.

NK cells have the ability to lyse cells without prior sensitization  and therefore are the subject of intense interest to be potentially used as immunotherapeutic targets to treat cancer. The crucial element for using NK cells in immunotherapy is the ability to control the signaling and activation pathways. Recent work has shown that the cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS), encoded by the Cish gene, can act as a checkpoint in NK activation by inhibiting IL-15 signaling, a major upregulator of NK cell activity. Furthermore, deletion of the Cish gene has been shown to increase the sensitivity of NK cells to IL-15, resulting in mice that are resistant to experimental metastasis.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed a method whereby modified NK cells can be used to treat cancer. The modified NK cells exhibit hypersensitivity to cytokines, such as IL-2 and or IL-15 stimulation and maintain expansion and anti-tumor functions with lower concentrations of IL-2 and IL-15.\n\nThe inventors have developed human Cish-/- NK derived cells and methodology to use these cells for cancer therapy. \n\nCompared to existing NK cell therapy, that uses unmodified NK cells, the inventors gene modified iPSC-derived Cish-/-NK cells have better anti-tumor effects.

Cyanide exposure contributes to smoke inhalation deaths in fires and could be used as a weapon of mass destruction. Cobalamin (vitamin B12) binds cyanide with a relatively high affinity and is used to treat smoke inhalation victims. Cobinamide, the penultimate compound in cobalamin biosynthesis, binds cyanide with about 1010 greater affinity than cobalamin and is 5-10 times more potent than cobalamin in rescuing animals from cyanide poisoning. Cobinamide is also an effective intra- and extracellular nitric oxide scavenger.  \nCurrently, three cyanide antidotes are currently available in the United States: nitrites, thiosulfate, and hydroxocobalamin. All three drugs are approved only for intravenous (IV) administration, and thus are not suitable for treating mass casualties as could occur after a major industrial accident or a terrorist attack. Thus, new formulations for cyanide exposure treatment that are faster and easier to administer are needed.  \n\nTechnology Description\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed methods for treating cyanide, sulfide, and methane thiol exposure in a patient.

Since 1970s, it has been suggested that CD8+ regulatory T cells play an important role in immune regulation of autoimmune diseases, transplant tolerance, and homeostasis of cellular and humoral immune responses. Among Treg subpopulations, an important role for Foxp3+CD4+ Treg and Foxp3- IL-10-secreting CD4+ T cells has been elucidated, while the function of CD8+ regulatory T cells in the gut has been hampered by an inability to distinguish them from conventional CD8+ T cells.

Unfortunately, even after decades of use and research, there is a significant shortage of histocompatible HSCs available for transplants. Transplanting larger numbers of HSCs increases the likelihood and speed of successful engraftment, which can reduce the risk of complications such as anemia and infection, and more effectively treat underlying disease. The inability to efficiently maintain adult HSCs ex vivo is also a significant barrier for the wider development and implementation of gene therapies for diverse blood diseases and a major obstacle for engineering HSC derived cellular products for immunotherapy. One approach to overcome this challenge is to develop a means to maintain and expand HSCs in culture. Unfortunately, there is no well-defined reproducible means to maintain or expand HSCs. Even short culture times in optimized conditions are deleterious to HSCs. Ex vivo HSC maintenance and expansion could significantly enhance their clinical utility in a wide range of human diseases, providing a new platform for testing drugs, enabling more efficient gene editing within stem cells, and developing into a widely-used tool for the research community.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have discovered and pioneered a method to maintain and expand adult HSCs ex vivo. This method utilizes interventions that modulate protein biogenesis and homeostasis pathways that are essential for stem cell self-renewal, but that become dysregulated in culture. Experiments have demonstrated that the method fully supports robust maintenance and expansion of HSCs in culture for at least 10 days. Cultured HSCs completely maintain their regenerative capacity as they are fully competent to give long-term multilineage reconstitution upon serial transplantation. \n\nThe invention enables the prolonged maintenance and expansion of HSCs in culture.

Using this technology, researchers revealed that UBAP2L may be an excellent future candidate to study how protein aggregation might be regulated both in the absence or presence of cellular stress.  \n    \n*   Therapeutic for diseases.\u00a0Lowering UBAP2L levels in patients with certain neurodegenerative diseases through one of many potential routes (RNAi, antisense oligonucleotides, CRISPR/Cas9) could prevent formation and buildup of potentially toxic protein aggregates.\n\nThis is an improvement over similar attempts to reduce SG formation because previous approaches employed proteins with known disease-association and critical functions in neuronal cells. UBAP2L may be less functionally critical, as suggested by minimal effects on cell viability upon UBAP2L knockout. A second significant improvement over previous approaches is the technology\u2019s ability to affect SG levels through targeted deletions within UBAP2L, thus not requiring a loss of function of the entire protein.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC San Diego have an invention that predicts the risk of autism or other de novo mutation diseases arising from male sperm. By assessing the sperm of males planning to have children using high read depth sequencing or single-molecule genotyping by Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR,) we can assess the risk that a fetus will receive a mutation that is present in the father\u2019s sperm but not present in the rest of his body. In this way, sampling the sperm is the most direct way of detecting the personalized risk of having a child with a disease.  \n\nApplications\n\nThis method can work with specific mutations (i.e. alleles), or a panel of genes contributing to a specific disease (i.e. the 'autism-ome') or a complete panel of genes that produce birth defects due to haploinsufficiency or other diseases when one copy of the gene is defective (i.e. \u2018haploinsufficiency-ome\u2019). Our invention produces an individualized risk assessment that can help couples decide whether to conceive naturally or through artificial insemination, through preimplantation genetic diagnosis, or through adoption.   \n\nAdvantages\n\nWe utilize well accepted methods from the cancer and human genetics field including ddPCR, panel deep sequencing, and risk assessment of candidate mutations. ddPCR methodology genotypes a particular allele in 10,000 parallelized PCR reactions, separated by droplets in in a single PCR reaction tube, to allow for high sensitivity and specificity of the mutation from a mixture of cells. \n\nState Of Development\n\nPresently, the invention is at a stage where we could accept human samples for testing of specific genetic mutations in sperm samples in a research setting. To date, for disease alleles, we have tested variants in ~20 patients with a primary diagnosis of ASD and could detect mosaic variants in 4.",

    "ip_description": "Angioedema is a non-itchy, pale swelling of subcutaneous or submucosal tissue that tends to recur chronically and can become life-threatening if the swelling occurs in the upper airways or can be very painful if it occurs in the gastrointestinal tract. Angioedema presenting together with urticarial (hives) usually responds well to antihistamines and corticosteroids, whereas angioedema without urticarial (hives) is frequently resistant to such therapy but may respond to a C1 esterase inhibitor, tranexamic acid, or both therapies that can reduce bradykinin generation.\n\nDifferentiating bradykinin-from histamine-mediated angioedema is of critical importance to prevent morbidity and mortality.\u00a0The ability to diagnose bradykinin-mediated angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor (C1INH), however has been severely limited by the lack of any available diagnostic test. Current genetic tests only identify a tiny fraction of the affected patients. Due to the lack of a known biomarker or assay, many patients without bradykinin-mediated angioedema are treated with unnecessary medications (often approaching $1,000,000/year or more in costs).\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed an assay which can identify those patients who have bradykinin mediated angioedema and to differentiate them from those who have histamine mediated angioedema. The test takes approx. 30 mins. Plasma kallikrein activity is stimulated ex vivo with sub-max doses of a contact system activator to distinguish bradykinin from histamine-mediated angioedema.\n\nThe current invention is a diagnostic test for the identification of patients with bradykinin-mediated angioedema compared with histamine-mediated angioedema. It may also help to identify patients who may benefit from bradykinin-targeted therapy.\n\nThe current assay allows clinicians to clearly separate patients with bradykinin-mediated from histamine-mediated angioedema.\u00a0Furthermore, the invention provides a simple assay that can be standardized and adapted for a clinical laboratory. The current situation is that there are no tests or biomarkers that can identify the large majority of patients with bradykinin-mediated angioedema.\n\nThe assay is fully developed and has been used in a study of 154 subjects from our angioedema center at UC San Diego.",

    "ip_description": "Training for direct laryngoscopy relies heavily on practice with patients. The necessity for human practice might be supplanted to some extent by an intubation manikin with accurate airway anatomy, a realistic \u201cfeel\u201d during laryngoscopy, the capacity to model many patient configurations, and a means to provide feedback to trainees and instructors.  \nThe realism and mobility of the anatomical features of current models limits the effectiveness of training intubation skills. Current models provide only one set of anatomic features, but patients present innumerable combinations of size, shape, proportion, and tissue stiffness. Thus, a novice who trains on a particular model merely learns how to intubate that particular model, but has minimal ability to transfer the learned skills to the multiplicity of anatomies in patients. Furthermore, most models approximate a normal anatomic configuration that poses no problem for intubation, so novices do not gain experience with difficult situations\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego designed an airway simulator with realistic dimensions and haptic sensation that could undergo a range of adjustments in several features that affect laryngoscopy difficulty, along with a system to display information on laryngoscopy force and motion in real time. \n\nThe manikin is a life-size model of the human head, neck and cervical spine that can be adjusted into shape and size configurations mimicking more than 300 patients. The model is used to train healthcare practitioners how to perform endotracheal intubation, taking human variability into account.\n\nTheir patent-pending invention incorporates novel features that aid in developing mastery of the laryngoscopy procedure, including: \n  \nAn automated assessment and record of the anatomic configuration of the manikin before the procedure starts. This feature is important because reproducing the specific anatomic configurations desired and necessary for optimal training can be difficult if based just on visual assessment. The calibration between the physical settings and the actual position can change with time and use. The invention will self-calibrate and eliminate that problem. \n  \nEnabling the tracking of the laryngoscope and endotracheal tube trajectory alignment to the anatomic structures regardless of which of the 300 or more configurations are selected. This feature is important because the positions of the mouth, pharynx, larynx and vocal cords varies appreciably among different configurations. Those shifts must be taken into account to provide healthcare students with accurate feedback about whether they are performing the procedure properly. \n  \n\nThe adjustable manikin and the sensor system for providing procedural feedback arepresent in working prototypes.

    "ip_description": "In the United States and most other developed countries, atherosclerosis is the leading cause of illness and death. In 2015, cardiovascular disease, primarily coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis that affects the arteries supplying blood to the heart) and stroke, caused almost 15 million deaths worldwide, making atherosclerosis the leading cause of death worldwide.\nAtherosclerosis means hardening of the arteries due to the presence of plaques, which are deposits of fatty materials. Atherosclerosis can affect the medium-sized and large arteries of the brain, heart, kidneys, other vital organs, and legs. Atherosclerosis begins when an injured artery wall creates chemical signals that cause certain types of white blood cells (monocytes and T cells) to attach to the wall of the artery. These cells move into the wall of the artery. There they are transformed into foam cells, which collect cholesterol and other fatty materials and trigger growth of smooth muscle cells in the artery wall. In time, these fat-laden foam cells accumulate. They form patchy deposits (atheromas, also called plaques) covered with a fibrous cap in the lining of the artery wall. With time, calcium accumulates in the plaques. Plaques may be scattered throughout medium-sized and large arteries, but they usually start where the arteries branch. Existing treatment options for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease are aimed at lowering Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by either increasing hepatic LDLR expression by using statins and PCSK9 inhibitors, or by reducing cholesterol absorption by using ezetimibe. Further development of therapeutic strategies is warranted due to various drawbacks and limitations using the current therapeutic options.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have discovered that the use of a unique sugar molecule found in human breast milk that can be used to attenuate hyperlipidemia, including hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and a combination of both.\n\nThis invention provides a method of treating or attenuating atherosclerosis and/or hyperlipidemia in a subject in need thereof comprising administering a composition comprising therapeutically effective amounts of one or more human milk-based oligosaccharides.\n\nThe proposed use of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) for treating atherosclerosis and/or hyperlipidemia and complications resulting therefrom, have notable advantages, including, but not limited to: (a) HMOs are naturally found in human milk, thus, HMOs are safe for human consumption; (b) HMOs can be administered orally; (c) can be used safely with pregnant women with cardiovascular disease.\n\nCurrent studies have shown that oligosaccharides can attenuate hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis in mice models",

    "ip_description": "Ice nucleating particles (INPs) suspended in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere influence cloud properties and can affect the overall precipitation efficiency and predictability of cloud systems worldwide. INPs induce freezing of cloud droplets at temperatures above their normal freezing-point (~-38 C), and at a relative humidity (RH) below the normal freezing RH of aqueous solution droplets at lower temperatures. These INP induced variabilities influence cloud lifetime, phase, as well as cloud optical and microphysical properties. Developing a relational model of INPs in global climate models has proven challenging as existing instrumentation systems either require too much air volume (in real-time flow instruments) or exhibit too much temperature variability (in off-line frozen assay based instruments).  Thus, there is a real urgency to address this unmet need.  Researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) have developed an updated, high-throughput off-line assay-based system known as the Automated Ice Spectrometer (AIS) to meet this need. They have come up with a novel improvement on immersion mode ice spectroscopy instruments for INP concentrations at specific temperatures of a liquid sample. INP measurements of air samples are made by collecting particles on a filter (or via impinging particles into liquid) and transferring the particles to ultra-pure water. The liquid sample is then distributed in microliter aliquots into a clean 96-well disposable polypropylene sample tray. The sample trays are then inserted into a specially engineered and heat-transfer modeled aluminum block that provides precise, rapid and uniform cooling until the samples are frozen. The freezing point of each well is automatically monitored using a software-controlled, real-time computer vision system designed to leverage optical changes of water droplets to detect freezing events.  This automated system affords greater accuracy that existing human-read approaches, giving greater accuracy and throughput to the instrument.  For the first time, heat transfer properties of the INP measurement technique are characterized using a finite-element analysis based heat transfer simulation to improve accuracy of INP freezing temperature measurement.  The heat transfer simulation provides a tool to explain the sources of bias in temperature measurements in existing INP measurement techniques, and ultimately explain the observed discrepancies in measured INP freezing temperatures between different instruments.  AIS measurements of the standard test dust illite NX are compared against 5 other immersion mode droplet assay techniques that use wet suspensions.  The AIS and its characterization of heat transfer properties allows higher confidence in accuracy of freezing temperature measurement, higher throughput of sample analysis, and enables disentanglement of the effects of heat transfer rates on sample volumes from time dependence of ice nucleation. An automated, computer controlled instrument to study the ice nucleating properties of suspended aerosol particles. In order to increase sample throughput and improve accuracy of Ice Nucleating Particle (INP) freezing temperature measurement, the exemplary immersion mode AIS both increases sample cooling rates and monitors changes in optical properties of water droplets during freezing. This offers advantages over existing instrumentation that are currently available. A prototype system has been fully tested and been operational for 6 months after going through 2 prototype stages. Samples have been tested against other systems using a particulate standard (Illite NX). A provisional patent has been submitted and the technology is available for licensing.",

They have discovered that in blast crisis (BC) CML, both an increase in JAK2 signaling and an amplification of BCR-ABL1 activate ADAR1. This is consistent with the finding in a humanized BC-CML mouse model, ADAR1 was down-regulated when both JAK2 and BCR-ABL1 were inhibited. Moreover, amplification of BCR-ABL1, a hallmark of BC transformation has been linked to LIN28B upregulation and the inhibition of the tumor suppressive miRNA, Let-7. These data suggest that ADAR1 regulates let-7 miRNA biogenesis in an A-to-I editing-dependent manner, which has a functional impact on BC CML progenitor self-renewal and survival.  The invention identifies a new set of biomarkers to detect leukemia stem cell (LSC) reprograming and chronic myeloid leukemia progression as well as new potential therapeutic targets for treating myelodysplastic syndrome and CML, such as Let-7.

Using a well-characterized rare male Rett Syndrome (RTT) patient-derived and genome-edited isogenic lines, enriched populations of cortical neurons and astrocytes were generated. RTT derived astrocytes showed significant gene expression and physiological differences compared to control cells. Co-culture experiments revealed that RTT-derived astrocyte impaired neuronal dendritic arborization and spinogenesis in control cells. In contrast, control-derived astrocytes rescued morphological RTT neuronal phenotypes. Astrocytes used in these studies were characterized by immune-staining methods, followed by plating and neuronal enrichment.\n\nApplications\n\nThe study of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk variants is critical for the understanding of autism pathophysiology and related diseases. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a valuable strategy to study the effects of these variants in living patient cells.

Thus, these new iPSCs derived astrocytes provides an advancement of the current state of the art. This concept also accelerates the differentiation process reducing the time from 180 to 300 days as proposed in the literature in 30 days.\n\nState Of Development\n\nWe have coverslips slides showing the success of the differentiation from stem cell to astrocytes using our defined protocol.",

Unfortunately, the application range of these legacy systems is limited by their size, weight, reliability and cost. Consequently, a substantial research effort has been directed toward the miniaturization and simplification of these systems. Recent work has focused on beam steering using phased arrays. Although optical phased arrays are an elegant non-mechanical beam steering approach, the technical and environmental challenges compared to RF systems (10,000 times smaller wavelengths and tolerances) are daunting. Multi-octave operation across the UV to LWIR regions with acceptable losses poses additional technical challenge for any optical phased array beam steering approach. For these reasons, a need exists for a non-mechanical beam steering approach that lends itself to miniaturization as well as high power ultra-wideband operation.\n\nResearcher at UC San Diego have proposed a new design to overcome some of the performance issues outlined above, whereby the operation at multiple wavelengths is possible through the use of broadband emitters. Likewise, simultaneous multi-beam, multi-spectral operation can be realized with this highly flexible approach. Compared to more conventional approaches this design has reduced size and weight, relaxed coherence requirements, improved robustness and reliability, and superior operating efficiency. The result is an integrated, scalable, compact, non-mechanical broadband beam steering system.\n\nNumerous applications exist, including optical beamsteering for medical applications (laser surgery, scanning microscopy), manufacturing applications (laser cutting), telecommunications, remote sensing and rangefinding.\n\nUnlike conventional phased array designs, there are no coherence requirements on the sources within the proposed approach since only a single emitter is active at any time.\n\nThe invention is at the conceptual stage.",

    "ip_description": "Standard digital cameras typically take images with under/overexposed regions because of their sensors\u2019 limited dynamic range. The most common way to capture high dynamic range (HDR) images using these cameras is to take a series of low dynamic range (LDR) images at different exposures and then merge them into an HDR image. Producing a high dynamic range (HDR) image from a set of images with different exposures is a challenging process for dynamic scenes. A category of existing techniques first register the input images to a reference image and then merge the aligned images into an HDR image. However, the artifacts of the registration usually appear as ghosting and tearing in the final HDR images.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have described the first learning-based technique to produce a high-dynamic-range (HDR) digital image using a set of low-dynamic-range (LDR) images captured from a dynamic scene. A convolutional neural network is used to generate the HDR image from a set of images aligned with optical flow. To properly train the network, a strategy is given to produce a set of input LDR images, with varied exposure, and their corresponding ground truth image. Three architectures for the learning-based techniques are examined and demonstrate that this model leads to improvement in dynamic settings where varied exposure and movement must be addressed. \n\nApplications\nThis technology will find ready application in digital photography, surveillance, autonomous systems and other image capture applications\nAdvantages\nThe algorithm takes a set of low dynamic range (LDR) images of DYNAMIC SCENES with different exposures as the input and outputs a high dynamic range (HDR) image. Alternatively, our method can take a set of noisy images of dynamic scenes with the same short exposures and generate a clean (denoised) image that are of a high quality.\n\nState Of Development\nWe demonstrate the performance of our system by producing high-quality HDR images from a set of three LDR images. Experimental results show that our method consistently produces better results than several state-of-the-art approaches on challenging scenes",

Recently, the incidence of HPV-induced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) has seen a rapid increase, especially in the US and other Western countries. Early oral HPV infections do not typically cause any clinical signs or symptoms. Currently, there is no standard screening test to reliably identify High Risk HP-related oral tumors, most of the current tests have been validated for cervical tumor samples and not for saliva or blood. Furthermore, the tests presently in use usually require some sort of confirmatory secondary test.  Performing tests for oral HPV should allow the detection of early\u2010stage, HPV\u2010related oral cancer recurrence as well as determine prognosis and overcome some of above issues. Researchers at UC San Diego have developed a DNA PCR-based assay for the detection of the HPV-16 subtype that is associated with approximately ~95% of all HPV-HNSCC. The test will be useful for detecting HPV in a patient\u2019s sample that can be from the blood, saliva, plasma or tumor. The highly sensitive HPV test is designed to detect HPV in HNSCC and related cancers. The test can also be used to monitor disease progression in a cancer patient in remission from an HPV-related cancer. The test has been tested on tumor samples from a cohort of 72 patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma as well as normal oropharynx tissue from surgical specimens obtained from 25 cancer unaffected controls.",

    "ip_description": "Optical spectroscopy excels at chemical identification and is ubiquitous in the sciences as a highly specific and noninvasive probe of molecular structure. The field is moving toward the integration of miniaturized optical spectrometers into mobile platforms which will have unprecedented impact on applications ranging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to mobile phones. To address this demand, silicon photonics stands out as platform capable of delivering compact and cost-effective devices and systems. The Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) is largely used in free-space spectroscopy, where its high signal throughput has proven a boon to overcoming the difficulties of otherwise overwhelming detector noise. Its implementation in silicon photonics manufacturing will contribute to bringing broadband operation and fine resolution to the chip scale enabling such attributes as compactness, power efficiency, real time operation and low cost. \n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed an integrated chip-scale channel dispersed Fourier transform (CDFT) spectrometer that is fully CMOS compatible. This spectrometer enables mobile spectroscopy on the chip and the measurement of weak spectral signatures by implementing channel dispersion that significantly improves signal fidelity and measurement speed over comparable Fourier transform spectrometers. The micro-architecture minimizes size, weight, and power footprint (SWaP) of the spectrometer is entirely self-contained to implement analyte signal transduction, optical coupling, guiding, filtering, interferometry and signal readout to interface with an external microprocessor or computer. These improvements over existing models may be achieved by splitting the input signal spectrum into a number of bands, separately analyzing each of these bands using a Fourier transform spectrometer, and combining the outputs to generate a final spectrum.\n\nIt can measure optical absorption, reflection, transmission, emission, scattering, and similar material interactions with light; it can be configured for operation in the visible, near infrared (NIR), or mid infrared (MIR).

    "ip_description": "Tumor resistance to radiotherapy can be an obstacle to patient therapy. On way to overcome radioresistance is via the use of drugs to sensitize cells to ionizing radiation (IR). Although many radiosensitizers have been developed, their clinical benefit is hampered by a failure to improve the therapeutic ratio due to a lack of tumor specific delivery over normal tissue. To overcome this obstacle, activatable cell penetrating peptides (ACPPs) target various cargoes to sites of protease activity in vivo. ACPPs consist of a polycationic cell penetrating peptide attached to a cargo and a polyanionic inhibitory domain with a protease cleavable linker. Probe activation and cargo uptake depends on localized proteolysis of the linker sequence that connects the polyanionic and polycationic domains, which converts the probe to an adherent form. This method provides detection of spatially localized enzymatic activity in living tissues via accumulation of cleaved probe. Recently, the use of anti-tumor drugs conjugated to antibodies has been introduced as a way to increase tumor kill and improve patient outcomes.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of utilizing cell penetrating peptides and antibody drug conjugates (ADC) to deliver radiosensitizers. Moreover, pretargeted ACPP technology allows for selective delivery of radiosensitizing agents to tumor as opposed to normal tissue and improvement in the therapeutic index of radiation therapy for non-resectable, locally aggressive tumors. Once cleaved, they release drug-conjugated polycation cell penetrating peptides that are taken up by tumor cells. Alternatively, ADC consist of a drug that is covalently attached to an antibody recognizing a specific cell surface receptor. The ADC binds to the specific receptor and undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis whereby the drug is released from the antibody via endolysomal proteases. \n\nApplications\nThe invention is purposed for use in personalized medicine for the radiosensitization of tumors utilizing drug conjugated activatable cell penetrating peptides (ACPP) or ADC as tumor selective delivery vehicles for potent radiosensitizers\nAdvantages\n\nThe current invention and method demonstrate the use of ADC to radiosensitize tumors, provide a decrease in toxicity and improvement in efficacy as measured in tumor models. The use of ADC with IR offers several advantages that can result in improved patient outcomes, specifically the reduction of risk in developing tumor resistance as well as other advantages.\n\nState Of Development\n\nAntibody drug conjugates (ADC) were synthesized and the conjugated antibodies were validated in vitro on tumor xenographs which radiosensitized tumor cells.",

A major challenge is that the hardware and software typically used to make measurements limit their use to controlled environments. Additionally, the low spatial resolution of EEG itself limits the amount of usable information that can be extracted from noise in dynamic recording environments. Lastly, the absence of a method to automatically extract user-environment interactions for tagging with EEG data introduces an immense overhead to researchers - having to manually tag events or limit experimental design by requiring the subjects to provide information during the experiments.  There are numerous sensors capable of measuring useful metrics for human behavior and interactions, however, limitations in the collection hardware and soft-ware hinder their use in experiments spanning multiple modalities. \nResearchers from UC San Diego addressed the key limitations of existing systems and developed an affordable, wearable multi-modal bio-sensing platform that is capable of monitoring EEG, PPG, eye-gaze, and limb dynamics. Furthermore, this novel platform supports the addition of other biosensors including galvanic skin response (GSR) and lactate levels. Leveraging the capabilities of this system, a new breadth of applications can be explored that allow for better translations to impactful solutions. \nApplications include the use as a wireless, multi-modal bio-sensing system which is comfortable to wear, and can reliably monitor bio-signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyography sensing (EMG) and galvanic skin conductance (GSR) in real-time. \nBy developing a low-cost, portable, multi-modal bio-sensing platform that is capable of interfacing with numerous different sensors, researchers are able to explore richer experimental questions that have previously been unable to be accessed due to the constrained nature of the measurement hardware\nThe UC inventors are currently focusing on the application of this multi-modal system for emotion recognition studies in outdoor settings.

The NLRP3 inflammasome has also been implicated in many chronic inflammatory and degenerative diseases from gout, osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Currently, there are no effective ways to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, thus there is a therapeutic need for this class of molecule.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have identified a novel kinase whose inhibition prevents NLRP3 inflammasome activation by all its known stimuli, and the researchers have identified its essential catalytic pocket and mechanism of action.\n\nAberrant NLRP3 activation is the key promoter to many chronic diseases. Specific inhibitors to this new kinase identified should be useful to treat cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, gouty arthritis, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, lupus, macular degeneration and cancer. \n\nNLRP3 inflammasome activation is required for production of IL-1\u03b2.

While FD-895 displays poor pharmacological stability (a factor common to nearly all semi-synthetic or synthetically-derived splice modulators to date), FDGLY displays improved stability in pharmacological buffers, plasma, cell lysates and animal models.  \n\nApplications\n\nFDGLY can be potentially used as a therapeutic agent in clinical use against cancer, as well as an agent to potentiate the effects of known cancer agents. An additional use would be for research, as a molecular probe to modulate splicing.\n\nAdvantages\nFDGLY offers the following improvements over known splicing modulators:\n\n\nImproved stability: unlike most of the natural product and synthetic derivatives designed to date FDGLY is bench stable. \n\nEasier synthetic preparation: the core unit of FDGLY is prepared from D-glucose streamlining the synthetic preparation. \n\nPotent activity in mammalian cell models: properties can be tuned to deliver unique splicing modulatory patterns. \n\nReadily addressed medicinal chemical optimization: the use of D-glucose has allowed analog developed to rapidly proceed using other carbohydrate building blocks.  \n\nThe potential for targeting the splicing of specific genes:  the carbohydrate motif allows this derivative, unlike any analog to date, to be subjected to detailed optimization of activity that targets specific genes.\n\nState Of Development\n\nThe synthesis of FDGLY has been completed and is currently being used in cell and animal models to complete pharmacological and activity studies. In addition, medicinal chemical efforts are being explored for translation into the clinic for the treatment of cancer. The use of FDGLY is being used to potentiate already known chemotherapeutic agents by using FDGLY to reduce the levels of the proteins targeted by known chemotherapeutics within targeted tumor cells.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The ability to accurately quantify gas volumes in liquid flows has important applications in environmental science and industry. For example, environmental processes that significantly contribute to changes in earth\u2019s climate, such as methane seeps from the sea floor and the exchange of gases between the ocean and atmosphere at the sea surface, demand precise sensors that are small and sensitive enough to measure the ratio of liquids and gases in these bubbly mixtures. These measurements also play a critical role in the operational efficiency of a wide variety of different engineering processes. Applications include, the monitoring the optimal amount of bubbled oxygen in the treatment of waste water and sewage, and the oil and gas industry, especially in undersea oil pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico alone, have spent billions of dollars annually on added refinement techniques to remove seawater that could be preventable if sensors were able to measure the ratio of crude oil, seawater and gas as the mixture is pumped through pipelines. These challenges exist in both research and industry because the current manufacturing process for making the needed gas/liquid probes have significant cost constraints. Clearly, there is a need for a new and cost-effective technology to produce these probes.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed a novel sensor system for measuring entrained gas volumes within liquid flows. The inventors have developed a scalable sensor system that can allow arrays of probes for very accurate real-time monitoring of flows with a per sensor cost of about 10% that of the leading company in the space. As a result, the novel manufacturing process breaks the traditional economic barriers of gas/liquid measurement and could accelerate the growth of this niche market.\n\nThe new technology incorporates several parts and fabrication techniques: the manufacture of a glass fiber sensing tip, the bonding of a manufactured tip onto a plastic fiber, and incorporation of the hybrid probe into electronic instrumentation for use as a sensor.\n\nThere is a large industry that requires instrumentation for the monitoring of two-phase\n\n(gas/liquid) flows including:\n\n*   Oil / gas industry \u2013 in the refining process and monitoring pipeline flows\n\n*   Bio and Chemical reactors \u2013 where bubbles are used for mixing\n\n*   Food industry - (wine, champagne, beer) need to monitor bubble and foam formation\n\n*   Environmental engineering - water plants, waste treatment facilities, fish farming\n\n*   Research industry - (medical, oceanographic etc.) the study of bubbles and air/liquid interfaces for science\n\nThe current invention produces repeatable probes at a fraction of the cost of presently available commercial systems.\nA prototype has been developed and has generated data during studies in marine settings.\u00a0Additional work will be required for the commercial market.",

The concept of adiabatic charging, where the capacitor is charged more slowly than nominally afforded by the natural RC time constant of the charging circuit in the pursuit of reducing energy dissipation to below \u00bd CV2, has been around for decades. However, there has not been any solution to enabling this slow charging phenomenon in a practical, low-overhead embodiment.

The present invention provides multiple levels in a small, efficient structure via a switched-capacitor approach to enable adiabatic charging for the first time in a practical solution.

    "ip_description": "Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) in the form of laparoscopic surgery has dramatically increased in the last decade and has led to reduced access trauma in addition to providing significant benefits for the patient via better recovery times and cosmetics. Robotic Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS) has also increased in popularity. Both methods require haptic feedback (sense of touch) to be successful. Current haptic feedback methods for tele-operated surgical systems involve integrated force sensors that are difficult to miniaturize, non\u00adsterilizable, non\u00adversatile, delicate, and costly. Haptic feedback methods such as displacement sensors and resistive sensors have a variety of shortcomings. When force is applied to the structure, there is strain, thereby, causing the electrical resistance in the strain gauge to change. Both of these methods are not adaptable to the existing endowrist instruments, and require modifications to the endowrist. Moreover, these methods often involve a trade\u00adoff between its function in measuring the magnitude and direction of force and its cost in manufacturing\u037e inventions involving these methods are composed of delicate and complex parts dramatically increasing the cost.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have created a Vibration Force Sensor that provides haptic feedback to the surgeon operating on tele-operated surgical systems during minimally invasive surgery.This feedback includes the magnitude and direction of force applied onto the end effector of the instrument. The Vibration Force Sensor can be attached to any tool head the doctor desires and is orders of magnitude less expensive than other force sensors. With this invention, the surgeon will be better aware of the interactive forces between the surgical tool and the patient\u2019s tissues and organs, thereby improving the safety and accuracy of the surgery.\n\nThe Vibration Force Sensor can be used in many types of robotics and sensory applications.

    "ip_description": "Medical devices and wearable consumer products have fundamental anatomically-driven size constraints that necessitate small form factors. Since most patients and consumers desire long battery life, and battery volume is limited by anatomy, one of the only ways to increase lifetime is to reduce the power of the underlying circuits. The power consumption of wireless communication circuits is often large, and while power can be minimized by restricting the communication distance to just a few meters from sensor nodes to a personal base station as part of a body-area network (BAN), it can still dominate the overall energy budget of a wearable device. Current human body communication (HBC) systems communicate using capacitive electrodes that are placed on the body and generate electric fields that then have fringing currents that travel through conductive biological tissues (in one embodiment \u2013 galvanic coupling) or fringing fields that interact with the surrounding environment (in another embodiment \u2013 capacitive coupling). Both techniques have slightly better path loss than conventional far-field RF techniques, but suffer from electrode impedance variation, environmental variation, or both, making the design of ultra-low power HBC systems difficult. Establishing methods that improve path gain and thus reduced power consumption will aid the functionality of industry devices greatly.  Researchers at UCSD have created an invention which offers a method and apparatus for human body communication using magnetic resonant coupling for wireless body-area network (BAN). This magnetic human body communication provides significantly improved path gain around the human body, compared to other conventional wireless communication techniques. As a result, this invention can reduce the communication power consumption for delivering the information between a transmitter and a receiver. In addition, by using the human body as a physical communication channel, this communication technique provides a higher level of security compared to broadcasting wireless communication systems (e.g., Bluetooth).\n\nSince magnetic fields are only minimally affected by biological tissue, coil impedances are relatively constant and thus resonant matching networks can be easily designed. In addition, the human body acts as a waveguide that helps the magnetic fields travel along the body with low loss, while enabling tight fall-off away from the body for limited broadcasting, and therefore good communication security. The invention therefore offers an ultra-low-power method to communication information around the body.\n\nAny wearable device that needs to wirelessly communicate information around the body with ultra-low power:\n\nwearable sensors\nactivity trackers \nsmartwatches \nEEG headsets\n\nSignificantly improved path gain around the human body compared to conventional methods \nReduced communication power consumption for information delivery \nHigher level of security compared to broadcasting wireless communication systems\n\nThe concept of invention has been validated by measurements using a demonstrated functional prototype.

Single chain antibodies were developed that were shown to specifically recognize 3R Tau in tissue from patients with AD and PiD and designed to be capable of penetrating the brain for therapeutic use in humans.

Specifically, two pA current references are generated via small tunneling-current metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) that are independent and proportional to temperature, respectively, which are then used to charge digitally-controllable banks of metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors that, via a discrete-time feedback loop that equalizes charging time, digitize temperature directly.

The gut barrier is comprised of a single layer of epithelial cells, bound by cell-cell junctions, and a layer of mucin that covers the epithelium. Loosening of the junctions induced either by exogenous or endogenous stressors, compromises the gut barrier and allows microbes and antigens to leak through and encounter the host immune system, thereby generating inflammation and systemic endotoxemia. An impaired gut barrier (e.g. a leaky gut) is a major contributor to the initiation and/or progression of various chronic diseases including, but not limited to, metabolic endotoxemia, type II diabetes, fatty liver disease, obesity, atherosclerosis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Despite the growing acceptance of the importance of the gut barrier in diseases, knowledge of the underlying mechanism(s) that reinforce the barrier when faced with stressors is incomplete, and viable and practical strategies for pharmacologic modulation of the gut barrier remain unrealized. \nTechnology Description\n Researchers at UC San Diego have dissected a novel molecular pathway that can help protect the integrity of the gut barrier from assault by harmful microbes and other stressors.

    "ip_description": "Selective chemical control of biochemical processes within a living cell enables the study and modification of natural biological systems in ways that may not be obtained through in vitro experiments. Accordingly, access to promiscuous metabolic pathways has provided a unique chemical entry into small molecule engineering in vivo.  A method for covalent reporter labeling of carrier proteins using permissive phosphopantetheinyltransferase (PPTase) enzymes and reporter-labeled coenzyme A (CoA) has been commonly used but has been limited to in vitro and cell-surface protein labeling, as CoA derivatives have not been shown to penetrate the cell.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have patented cell-penetrating analogues of metabolic precursors that can be used ex vivo to site-specifically label proteins. The key feature of this approach is the availability of a viable uptake mechanism, specifically this technology overcomes the obstacle of cell permeability by using labeled metabolic precursors that can be delivered directly into cell culture, which allows for cellular uptake and metabolic conversion into active, labeled CoA derivatives. For example, by reacting pantetheine (or a derivative thereof) with a reporter to form labeled pantetheine.  Researchers at UC San Diego have patented phosphorylating the labeled pantetheine to form phosphopantetheine, adenylating the labeled phosphopantetheine to form a labeled dephosphoCoenzyme A, and phosphorylating the 3\u2019-hydrozyl of the labeled dephosphoCoenzyme A to create a labeled coenzyme A analog. \n\nApplications\n\nThis method may be applicable to natural product pathway manipulation as well as applications in conventional molecular and cellular biology. Furthermore, this method is useful for characterizing biochemical pathways as well as dissecting protein expression, activity, or function in a cell. The significant tolerance to structural modification manifested by the enzymes in this pathway should allow delivery of a wide variety of chemical moieties to ex vivo processes. The reversibility of this labeling approach was demonstrated by the inventors in a subsequent study that used PPTase and acyl carrier proteins (ACP-fusion proteins) for visualization and functionalization studies (Kosa et al 2012, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22983458 ). \n\nAdvantages\n\nProvides an in vivo route to label proteins within the cell using reporter-labeled pantetheine as a cell-permeable precursor to gain access to CoA biosynthetic and proteinmodification pathways. applicable to natural product pathway elucidation, fusion protein localization, and decoding of complex expression patterns.\n\nThe advantage of using a fluorescently tagged pantetheine analog is that it is cell permeable, whereas pre-labeled coenzyme A analogs remain outside the cell. This allows the selective in vivo labeling of targeted proteins and fusion constructs. \n\nCan be used to probe natural product producing organisms to identify and manipulate the proteins from biosynthetic systems. Additionally, this technology could be incorporated into a fusion-protein system for in vivo reporter labeling of proteins. \n\nState Of Development\nIn vivo labeling and cellular update studies have been demonstrated in E. coli.",

It is useful for assessing tissue perfusion in a number of surgeries, particularly abdominal, heart, plastic, hepatic as well as other areas of medicine. The light needed for the excitation of the fluorescence is generated by a near infrared light source which is attached directly to a camera. A digital video camera allows the absorption of the ICG fluorescence to be recorded in real time, which means that perfusion can be assessed and documented. Currently, ICG provides a visual representation of tissue perfusion as a global view. Although some efforts have been put into density analysis, no device or software currently performs dynamic evaluation of blood flow for a surgeon. Without objective dynamic measurements, practitioners are only limited to snap shot view of the static environment. This is a problem because it is the dynamics of blood flow that determines tissue perfusion, not how much blood present at a stationary point in time. Furthermore, because there are no numerical evaluations out on the market that can capture this dynamic aspect of blood flow, practitioners are forced to use the naked eye to make a clinical decision that is not only subjective, but is difficult to assess between cases. \nTechnology Description\n Clinicians at UC San Diego have developed a method of filtering the background noise to obtain dynamic ICG signal then perform analysis as a function of time to make inferences to tissue perfusion. When done during the operation, this information can be given to clinical practitioners in real-time to make clinical decisions. This invention will potentially allow doctors to perform ICG fluorescence on tissue and decide exactly how well or poorly perfused it is and make decisions on management based on this. This software provides the temporal intensity ruler for measuring how well an organ or tissue is perfused with blood. This standardization of measurement will allow fluorescent surgery to become a viable technique based on verifiable scientific method. \nApplications\n This invention can be used as a diagnostic tool for surgeons. They can use it in the following cases: \u2022 Plastic surgery: skin and muscle transplants; determination of amputation level \u2022 Abdominal surgery: gastrointestinal anastomosis \u2022 General surgery: wound healing and ulcers \u2022 Internal medicine: diabetic extremities \u2022 Heart surgery: aortocoronary bypasses \u2022 Tissue perfusion \u2022 Hepatic function \u2022 Cardiac output monitoring \nAdvantages\n This invention allows for the evaluation of the perfusion of blood in tissue in real-time thus providing an objective assessment of the patient and potential outcomes.\nState Of Development\n The invention has been validated by demonstrating in live-pig studies the blood flow and quantification of it.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC San Diego have developed a general protocol and methodology for systematic localization of all potential chromatin-interacting RNAs in an unbiased fashion. This approach involves mapping Global RNA Interactions with DNA by deep sequencing (GRID-seq) via using a bivalent linker to ligate RNA to DNA in situ and present a global picture on RNA-chromatin interactions, exposing distinct classes of cis- and trans-acting RNAs in both human and Drosophila genomes. This invention provides a method to detect chromatin interacting RNAs in any given state of a cell or tissue by examining global RNA interactions with DNA by deep sequencing. This invention further provides methods to generate a global view of the chromatin-RNA interactome by mapping the binding locations on the genome of each detected chromatin interacting RNA. This invention allows for systematic localization of all potential chromatin-interacting RNAs in an unbiased fashion. Utilization of this methodology revealed a large set of both coding and non-coding RNAs in both human and Drosophila genomes that are prevalently associated with enhancers, particularly super-enhancers, which enable us to infer enhancer-promoter connectivity in 3D genomes.  Recent decades of genomic research reveal that mammalian genomes are more prevalently transcribed than previously anticipated. It is now quite clear that mammalian genomes express not only protein-coding RNAs but also a large repertoire of non-coding RNAs that have regulatory functions in different layers of gene expression. Many of those regulatory RNAs appear to directly act on chromatin, as exemplified by various long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs). Some of those regulatory RNAs mediate genomic interactions only in cis, while others, such MALAT1 and NEAT1, are capable of acting in trans. These findings suggest an emerging paradigm in regulated gene expression via specific RNA-chromatin interactions. Various techniques have been developed to localize specific RNAs on chromatin. These methods, such as chromatin Isolation by RNA purification or comprehensive identification of RNA binding proteins (ChIRP), capture hybridization analysis of RNA targets (CHART), and RNA affinity purification (RAP), all rely on using complementary sequences to capture a specific RNA followed by deep sequencing to identify targets on chromatin. Importantly, all of these methods only allow analysis of one known RNA at a time, and up to date, a global view is lacking on all RNA-chromatin interactions, which is critical to address a wide range of functional genomics questions.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UC San Diego have developed a small molecule based methodology for predicting prognosis in a cancer patient by determining the expression level of at least a subset of genes in a VM gene module in solid tumors. This discovery informs a universal set of VM diagnostic biomarkers for improving assignment of patients to therapies, which may be useful for diseases like ductal carcinoma in situ and prostate cancers that are frequently over-treated due to an inability to distinguish indolent from aggressive disease. Furthermore, the work will inform potential therapeutic strategies for combatting VM-mediated metastasis in which increased expression of the genes in the VM gene module is indicative of a poor prognosis.  One of the characteristic trademarks of tumorigenesis is the need for an extensive vascular system to supply blood for the tumor to grow and disseminate from the original node to distant sites via the process of metastasis. This involves the growth of new vessels from existing vessels, as well as the migration of tumor cells through the extracellular matrix (ECM) and into the lymphatic or vascular systems. However, some very aggressive solid tumors can form vascular channels by themselves, which is termed vascular mimicry (VM). Moreover, only certain cells in these tumors have the ability to produce blood-transporting channels, contributing to metastasis. There is growing evidence that supports the idea that VM can be a prognostic factor for poor clinical outcomes in various types of cancer. Currently, VM is identified by a pathologist\u2019s evaluation of histological slides, wherein vascular-like structures that do not stain positive for endothelial cells are identified as VM. Thus far, conserved molecular biomarkers that define this phenotype have remained unknown. This invention can be used as a potential diagnostic tool for cancer patients. When a person is diagnosed with a solid tumor, a gene expression test is performed and the state of expression of the genes included in the gene set would be assessed as low or high. If the level of expression is high, a recommendation of a more aggressive treatment regimen and more careful follow-up would be recommended by the treating physician because the patient is high risk for metastasis. This invention can be used as a potential diagnostic tool for cancer patients with a variety of different solid tumors. It can also be used for patient segmentation and the ability to distinguish indolent from aggressive disease. The invention has been validated by demonstrating that this gene set was found to be predictive of patient survival in early stages of breast cancer and in 5 other solid tumor types.",

Moreover, structural features normally found in cell membranes such as curvature and polarity are mostly absent. In this regard, an efficient reconstitution methodology that better mimics the native chemical environment of a whole-cell embedded protein would be highly useful. \nResearchers from UC San Diego have developed a novel approach that uses native chemical ligation to reconstitute the A2A adenosine receptor as a model GPCR into proteoliposomes, without the need for detergent removal. More specifically, the inventors have shown that A2AR, a subclass of GPCRs, can be spontaneously reconstituted in synthetic liposomes resulting from NCL driven membrane formation. \nThis technology can be leveraged for high-throughput drug screening against GPCR targets. Other biotechnological applications of INSYRT may include designing new functional biomimetic materials and the application to developing synthetic cells. \nKey features of this method include orthogonality, rapid reaction rates, and biocompatibility, making it a powerful option for reconstituting challenging membrane proteins. \nThe incorporation of A2AR into synthetic lipids demonstrates the utility of this technology to GPCR research. The receptor activity was validated by radioligand saturation and competition binding, as well as by confocal microscopy imaging of the resulting proteoliposomes (Brea et al in press).",

The delivery of a cell therapy where a known quantity of cell activation occurs at a specific, selected site may therefore be advantageous. UC San Diego researchers have recently developed the methods and materials for remote control of cellular activation, to dynamically manipulate molecular events for immunotherapeutic effect. \n\nResearchers at UC San Diego developed a technology that offers controllable cellular therapeutic activation of engineered T-cells, using a method of remote stimulation.

The method of cellular stimulation is based on widely-adopted medically-approved medical device technology that is non-invasive, and safe.

Currently, there is no effective drug intervention. Grafting healthy eye cells to replenish the diseased tissues such as retina represents a promising therapeutic approach. However, previous attempts at using primary human eye cells have met with limited success due to the limited expansion capacity and differentiation potential of adult progenitors or difficulty of obtaining sufficient human fetal retinal progenitors, and possible ethical concerns. Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent promising renewable donor sources for cell-based replacement therapy. Nevertheless, PSCs themselves are not suitable for direct transplantation in clinical applications due to their tendency to form teratomas and low efficiency in repopulating host tissues with desirable reprogrammed cell types in vivo.  \nWhile the advancement of clinical trials of hESC-derived RPE transplants for treatment of patients with Stargardt's macular dystrophy and AMD is encouraging to the field, there is a great need for methods of generating unlimited other specialized eye cells effectively in vitro for treating blindness due to the loss of photoreceptors, RGCs and CECs. Therefore, there is a major interest in development of in vitro expandable cell sources for engineering corneal endothelium. \n\nTechnology Description\nResearchers at UC San Diego have developed a small molecule based methodology to derive human CESs from PSCs via ocular lineage specification. A three-step strategy was employed; [1] eye field stem cells (EFSCs) were derived from PSCs, (2) EFSCs were directed to ocular neural crest stem cells (NCSC) fate, and (3) differentiated ocular NCSCs to human corneal endothelial cells (CECs) resulting in a homogeneous and expandable monolayer of CECs in culture.       \n\nApplications\nA therapeutic composition and method for treating a patient in need of ocular therapy.\nA research tool comprising a feeder-free and serum-free culture of corneal endothelial cells (CECs).\n A method of identifying a pharmaceutically active agent, comprising combining a pharmaceutical candidate with a feeder-free and serum-free culture of corneal endothelial cells (CECs) and detecting a desired pharmaceutical activity, thereby identifying a pharmaceutically active agent.  \n\nAdvantages\nUnlike previously reported induction procedures, the present methods utilize a novel small molecule-based approach to derive human CECs along with three major retinal cell types, RPE, photoreceptor and RGC, from PSCs in a directional fate restriction fashion.

    "ip_description": "Modern mobile applications strive for the complete integration of all communication systems in CMOS. Unfortunately, it is conventionally difficult to efficiently generate high levels of RF power in scaled CMOS largely due to the inherently low voltage ratings of core transistors. To realize high output power with ~1V transistors, power combining techniques have been proposed whereby the output of several low-voltage power amplifier (PA) cells are combined via inductive transformers. However, power combining relies on ultra-thick metal that still carries large ohmic and substrate losses. These AC-AC losses, combined with the DC-AC losses of the PAs themselves, and the DC-DC losses of the battery-connected power converters, result in limited total transmitter efficiencies. Even modern digital PA techniques such as RF-DACs, digital Doherty, and digital out-phasing, which have been proposed to leverage the excellent switch performance of scaled transistors and offer reconfigurable operation, still require battery-connected DC-DC converters and RF transformers/power combiners, both of which result in cascaded losses.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have invented a DC-RF power inverter that efficiently synthesizes high-voltage RF waveforms directly from a battery voltage using thin-oxide CMOS switches. Instead of stacking transistors or employing large inductive transformation ratios, high output power is generated by switching individual class-D power amplifier (PA) cells in a 2-phase house-of-cards (HoC) topology to provide voltage addition of the cells outputs without exceeding device voltage ratings, effectively resulting in a solid-state RF impedance transformer. High-efficiency at back-off is then achieved by capacitively combining the output of two HoC networks nominally set to generate different amplitudes, enabling voltage-mode Doherty-like back-off without a bulky transmission line. The PA is implemented in 65nm bulk LP CMOS, operates from 4.8V, and provides a battery-to-RF efficiency above 40% at both 23dBm and 6dB back-off at 720MHz.\n\nThe technology is suitable for broad range of applications, including: RFpower amplifiers (PA), 20kHz audio amplifiers, and 50-60 Hz power inverters. The above technology will have immediate application in portable electronics by leveraging an all CMOS design (no separate PA\u2019s or transformers) to reduce the cost and complexity of hardware while also extending battery life.\n\nThe key advantage of the proposed technology is CMOS compatibility, high efficiency, which equates to longer battery life and operational\u2010time.\n\nResearch stage with a working prototype",

More specifically, using this technique with methylene blue produces a dose-dependent signal in the presence of heparin and is ideal for monitoring drugs, like heparin, with a narrow therapeutic window. \n\nBackground\n  Heparin anticoagulation therapy is a cornerstone of surgical and cardiovascular medicine because of its short half-life, reversible nature, and low cost, but it also suffers from a narrow therapeutic window and is the second most common medication error. It is used prophylactically in pediatric patients undergoing angiography, bypass, cannulation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, as well as therapeutically in thromboses, and cancer. Heparin is used in 15% of pediatric inpatients, and approximately one in seven patients has an adverse event, for an annual morbidity of 140,000; mortality rates of the diseases treated with heparin are 2-20% and include cerebral sinovenous thrombosis and vascular thromboembolism. These inherent challenges are compounded by iatrogenic errors such as incorrect heparin ordering, inaccurate infusion pump settings, and incomplete record keeping, resulting in ~10,000 heparin medication errors per year. Heparin is involved in more medication errors than morphine and vancomycin with multiple deaths annually particularly in neonates. Thousands more suffer from hemorrhages or emboli because of inaccurate dosing and dosing/monitoring programs that are designed for adult populations. Because of these issues, heparin anticoagulation therapy must be monitored very carefully. The current standard of care is the activated partial thromboplastin time; however, this in vitro diagnostic tool requires large blood volumes and suffers from long turnaround times, a variable pediatric reference range, and poor correlation to heparin dose/patient performance. Clearly, there is an unmet need for a real-time and non-invasive tool to monitor heparin.1The field of pediatric coagulation are desperate for new and improved analytical instrumentation to increase the efficacy of heparin monitoring.",

That is because the lactate alters the regulation of biosynthetic enzymes, and can lead to changes in pH in the culture. To mitigate the negative effects of lactic acid accumulation and control the culture pH, chemical \u2018base\u2019 is added to the media during the course of a bioprocess.

    "ip_description": "Most high throughput genetic screening technology relies on phenotypes that can be coupled to an easily-detectable phenotype, such as fluorescent cell sorting, cell imaging, or cell death. However, many genetic variants may result in a phenotype that is much more subtle and cannot be easily detected by existing screening technologies.  It is currently difficult for researchers to examine a variety of different outcomes in one setting, with many of those parameters not being possible to quantify. Being able to assess the functional outcomes on a larger number of individual cells may substantially improve the efficiency of screening. \n\nUC San Diego researchers have developed a method that enables the detection of subtle genetic phenotypes, by assaying changes in gene expression that result when a genetic perturbation is made. This allows analysis of a broader phenotype covering the expression levels of more than 20k genes. Beyond this, the tools allow interrogation of gene pathways and regulatory networks in a novel fashion, facilitating a direct read-out the effect of genetic perturbations on all genes.\n\nThis invention is a method for highly efficient characterization of the functional consequences of cellular genetic modifications, and to be able to do so in many individual mammalian cells in parallel. It is based on the principles of the CRISPR system, leveraged such that the exact genetic modification in each cell, as well as the functional consequences of the modification in the form of gene expression, can be determined in a massively parallel manner. \nThis patent-pending technology will have a number of important applications, including comprehensive characterization of disease-causing genetic mutations, screening of potent T-cells for immunotherapy, high throughput production optimization, and discovering therapeutically relevant neutralizing antibodies.",

Attempts to eradicate these diseases by eliminating the Aedes aegypti mosquito by conventional use of spraying insecticides has met with limited success. So, in the absence of effective mosquito abatement, vaccines may provide the best strategy of preventing disease. Currently, there are vaccines for Yellow Fever and Dengue Fever (undergoing further testing); no vaccines exist for either Chikungunya or Zika virus at present. In the absence of such vaccines, UC San Diego researchers have developed a novel approach to control the spread of mosquitos.\n\nResearchers from the laboratory of Ethan Bier at UC San Diego have developed an alternative technology for mosquito control by specifically targeting the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Genetically modified strains of Aedes aegypti will be introduced into the general mosquito population to suppress as well as eliminate the target populations. Specifically, Aedes aegypti will have a Cas9-mediated split gene-drive system for masculinizing the mosquito and ensuring that any female carries a sterile mutation. In addition, gRNAs direct Cas9 cleavage of insecticide-resistance loci, renders female mosquitos that escape the male converting gene drive, are sensitive to insecticides. This novel approach works by combining split gene drives and a female sterile fail-safe mechanism that acts as a secondary built-in population suppression strategy.\n\nThe technology provides a mechanism for reducing or eliminating populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitos.\n\nOffers a lower cost than Sterile Insect Technology and may be more effective method for elimination of Aedes aegypti mosquitos\n\nResearch stage",

    "ip_description": "In today\u2019s world, mobile devices are becoming more sophisticated and capable of performing more complex functions especially with the availability of medical apps which are designed to assist individuals in their own health and wellness management. Most of the mobile devices contain both a sensor and a processor.  However, the devices are increasingly being tasked with gathering or acquiring data and transmitting that data to an external or cloud server.  The process of digitizing and wirelessly transmitting the data to an external server, requires a large consumption of energy; most mobile devices are constrained by the battery energy that is readily available.  \n\nUC San Diego researchers have overcome this constraint by designing a more energy efficient data interpretation method that contains an internal sensor(s) that can communicate directly with an internal processor. The processor runs a Bayesian inference algorithm on data collected by the sensor and characterizes the uncertainty quantification around the latent variables of interest. This sets in motion an optimization algorithm to calculate the posterior of the data from the sensor.  The processor can then transmit in an intelligent manner, only a representation of the data to an external server, thereby saving energy. \n\nApplications\n\nThe system is modularized and is universally applicable for different types of sensing, for example speech, video and physiologic monitoring.  It is also suitable for wearables, mobile phones and tablets.  \n\nAdvantages\n\nThe algorithm allows for bi-directional communication thereby allowing a remote device to communicate and re-configure the tolerance settings for what should be estimated and what the boundaries are in terms of estimate and uncertainty intervals. This also results in significant energy savings, thus preserving battery life.  In addition, If the mobile device is equipped with an actuator (speaker, LED, or electric stimulator) the system will allow for closed-loop sensing, interpretation and actuation without the need for relaying information wirelessly to an external device.\n\nState Of Development\n\nThe invention has been implemented within a portable, multi-core processor (e.g. the Parallela system).  This technology allows for parallelized computation by virtue of the Graphic Unit Processing (GPU) solution, which can be implemented in wearables, mobile phones, or tablets.  A working computer model simulation of an analog solver comprised of N circuits suggests that this technology can be used in future analog hardware systems.",

The output reference current is generated by driving a set of gate-leakage transistors designed to have opposing temperature coefficients with a stabilized voltage reference. Low-power operation is achieved by generating the voltage reference via a novel two-stage, 4T push-pull structure that can operate at a low supply voltage, and driving this reference to the gate-leakage transistors via a low-voltage self-biased amplifier. Designed in a 65 nm CMOS process, the proposed current reference generator is simulated to consume 14.5 pW at a 0.5 V supply voltage. Due to the push-pull structure and complementary gate-leakage transistors, the design achieves a temperature stability of 31 ppm/C from 0C to 100C, and a line sensitivity of 0.94%/V, thereby enabling an ultra-low-power, area-efficient, and temperature- and supply stabilized current reference solution at pico Amp-levels.\n\nApplications\n\nUltra-low-power and low-voltage current references are an integral part of advanced wireless sensing networks, IoT, environmental monitoring and implantable medical devices.

Non-fusogenic pSi particles were found in the cells in small groups indicative of endosomal uptake and lysosomal localization.

The researchers have created a human platform using pluripotent stem cells, to test the impact of Zika during cell proliferation, aggregation, formation of neurospheres, neuronal maturation, and structural brain organization using cerebral organoids in vitro.\n\nThe suspected link between infection by Zika virus (ZIKV), a re-emerging flavivirus, and microcephaly is an urgent global health concern. The direct target cells of ZIKV in the developing human fetus are not clear. The recent publication in Nature indicates that a strain of the ZIKV, MR766, serially passaged in monkey and mosquito cells efficiently infects human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Infected hNPCs further release infectious ZIKV particles. Importantly, ZIKV infection increases cell death and dysregulates cell-cycle progression, resulting in attenuated hNPC growth. Global gene expression analysis of infected hNPCs reveals transcriptional dysregulation, notably of cell-cycle-related pathways. These results identify hNPCs as a direct ZIKV target. In addition, researchers have established a tractable experimental model system to investigate the impact and mechanism of ZIKV on human brain development and provide a platform to screen therapeutic compounds.\n\nThis is a unique platform, never described before. Using potential therapeutic interventions, such as drugs or vaccines, laboratories around the world can use this system to investigate whether a putative anti-Zika candidate actually works, potentially utilizing this model to generate data relating to the efficacy of the therapeutic candidate in human/mouse models.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Heart failure following a myocardial infarction (MI) continues to be one of the leading causes of death. Immediately after MI, there is an initial inflammatory response with cardiomyocyte death and degradation of the extracellular matrix. This results in negative left ventricular (LV) remodeling leading to wall thinning, LV dilation, and depressed cardiac function. Several experimental approaches have been examined to inhibit this negative remodeling process. One promising direction is the use of injectable biomaterials, which can be used as stand-alone scaffolds to encourage endogenous repair or for delivering therapeutics such as cells, growth factors, or small molecules.  Early intervention of MI has the potential to slow or inhibit the progression of negative LV remodeling. To date, most therapeutic delivery strategies have involved intramyocardial biomaterial injections, although translation to acute MI patients is unlikely given the increased risk of ventricular rupture immediately post-MI. One promising, minimally invasive strategy is the systemic injection of nanoparticles. However, many of the investigated systems lack long-term retention within the MI.\n\nResearchers from UC San Diego have developed a method for targeting and retaining intravenously injected nanoparticles at the site of acute myocardial infarction. Enzyme-responsive peptide\u2013polymer amphiphiles are assembled as spherical micellar nanoparticles, and undergo a morphological transition from spherical-shaped, discrete materials to network-like assemblies when acted upon by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), which are up-regulated in heart tissue post-myocardial infarction. These enzyme-responsive nanoparticles provide an efficient template for targeting the acute MI and remain in the infarct for up to 28 d post-injection.  This unique approach constitutes a minimally invasive method for the delivery of a material scaffold to acutely infarcted myocardium, providing a promising approach for prolonged therapeutic delivery (e.g. peptide, small molecules, etc.) to treat an acute myocardial infarction. \n\nDemonstrated proof-of-concept that the enzyme-responsive nanoparticles target, assemble, and are retained in an acute MI, thereby providing a promising approach for delivery of therapeutics immediately post-MI and obviating the need for risky intramyocardial injections.

    "ip_description": "Detection of drug resistant residual oncologic disease is a major technical challenge since the cells can hide in low numbers at any spatial location and may not always be detected in blood draws or aspirates. Residual tumor cells can lie dormant for long periods and can reinitiate tumor growth leading to disease relapse. There is no way to visualize and track cancer stem cells in vivo. Moreover, there is a critical need for the development of methods to specifically target drug resistant residual disease, and to detect cancers at earlier stages. The researcher has focused on the role of Musashi (Msi), a highly conserved RNA binding protein originally identified in drosophila, since Msi is expressed in stem and progenitor cells across many tissues, and long been used as a marker of undifferentiated cells.    \n\nThe researcher has developed a novel fluorescent reporter mouse in which fluorescent signals reflected endogenous Msi expression (Msi1eYFP, Msi2eGFP, Msi1 reporter mice (Reporter for Musashi1, or REM1) showed expression in the stem cell enriched adult subventricular zone, and Msi1+ cells were Nestin+ and CD133+  consistent with Msi1 marking neural stem/progenitor cells. Msi2 reporters (REM2) reflected endogenous expression of Msi2, being  highest in hematopoietic stem cells and declining with maturation.\nThe Msi reporters described here represent exciting new tools that could be broadly useful for studying cancer. Because Msi reporter activity can be visualized through live imaging these reporter mice can be uniquely used to image and track cancer stem cells in vivo, and can provide a dynamic view of endogenous cancer growth, tumor dissemination and metastasis in its native microenvironment.  The fact that reporter positive cells are preferentially gemcitabine resistant, raises the exciting possibility that this could serve as a new platform to identify therapy resistance in vivo. The integration of such reporters in drug development may provide a powerful and sophisticated complement to traditional screens, by allowing the identification of therapies that are better able to target tumor propagating cells, and drug resistant residual disease. In addition, the spatially restricted distribution of Msi+ cells could have important implications for loco regional, aggressive targeting of driver cells that mediate resistance and disease relapse.\n\nThis invention  could provide a new and unique platform for drug discovery. In addition to its application in cancer drug development, the model may also allow for development of diagnostic and prognostic kits for these diseases. The model could be used to identify and screen compounds that expand stem cell populations and trigger improved regeneration in a variety of tissues.\n\nThe reporter mice have been developed and tested in pancreatic cancer.  These reporters allowed functional and image based tracking of stem cell signals within cancers in vivo, revealing that Msi expression rises as premalignant lesions progress to adenocarcinoma, and that Msi reporter+ tumor cells are the key drivers of pancreatic cancer: they preferentially harbor capacity to propagate adenocarcinoma, are enriched in circulating tumor cells, and are markedly drug resistant.",

    "published_date": "12/10/2019",
    "ip_description": "In conventional vessel encoded pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (PASL), the temporal signal to noise (tSNR) is improved by repeatedly applying pulsed labeling pulses in between Look-Locker readouts.  This works optimally when the temporal width of the tagged boluses matches the inter-pulse spacing. However, because the feeding arteries generally have different velocities and geometries, the conventional labeling slab fails to achieve desirable tSNR.   \n\nUCSD researchers have developed a novel labeling method that creates a wedge-shaped (WS) inversion slab, with the thickness at different arteries matching their velocities, aiming for an equal temporal bolus width that matches the inter-pulse spacing in different feeding arteries, therefore optimized tSNR.  The WS inversion pulse uses a combination of conventional slice-selective adiabatic fast passage (SS-AFP) and additional in-plane gradient pulses. \n\nApplications\n\nFunctional MRI(fRMI)studiesandtissueperfusionwithMRI including:  \n \u00b7Diagnostic imaging in stroke.  \n\u00b7Image based guidance for intra-arterial treatment of stroke.  \n\u00b7Risk Assessment for stroke.  \n\u00b7Evaluation of blood supply to tumors.  \n\u00b7Evaluation of blood supply to organ transplants such as kidneys.  \n\u00b7Evaluation of collateral blood supply in carotid or other cerebrovascular disease. \n\nAdvantages\n\nUCSD method, when compared to other conventional methods, requires shorter pulse duration, lower RF power, achieves better temporal resolution and tSNR;\n\nA working software on GE MRI scanner has been developed. This method has been simulated in Matlab and implemented on a human MRI scanner.   Experimental data has been collected on phantoms to demonstrate  its capability of generating different designated  inversion thickness  at up to three in-plane locations and generating  uniform bolus temporal width in vessel phantoms with different flow velocities.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers and engineers from UC San Diego have patented a scalable hybrid integration scheme to fabricate vertically aligned individually electrically addressable Si nanowire probes in array configurations with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. This invention is a novel architecture of a neural probe, with high density nanowire electrodes and individual electrode addressability, for in vitro intracellular measurements. This advanced design permits a higher level of sensitivity in nanowire recordings from cortical neurons and promises to pave the way for scalable neurotechnologies suitable for large scale mapping of neuronal activity in 2D and 3D configurations, particularly for novel pharmaceutical platforms.\n\nThe developed technology has the potential to replace conventional planar microelectrode arrays. Its intracellular capability at high densities allows for precise measurement of neuronal activity and the minute potential fluctuations that precedes such activity. The applications can extend to longer MEAs for retinal studies and brain-slice measurements. The nanoscale 3D aspects will allow the studies and development of new frontiers in neuroscience and may impact our understanding of how neurons interact together in a neuronal network. Measurement of subthreshold activity using Si nanowire probes from human neurons opens up new prospects on mapping neuronal activity in large networks of neurons. Given the scalability of this new technology, the simultaneous recording of minute changes in cell potentials can uncover details on the synthesis, processing, and execution of neuronal network activity, spontaneously, or pharmacologically. In-vitro, highly parallel drug screening experiments can be performed without the need of the laborious non-scalable patch-clamp.",

    "ip_name": "Software for auto-generation of text reports from radiology studies",
    "ip_number": "25750",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Imaging machines used for radiology studies often export data (such as vascular velocities, bone densitometry, radiation dose, etc.) as characters stored in image format. Radiologists are expected to interpret this data and also store it in their text-based reports of the studies. This is usually accomplished by dictating the data into the text report or copying it by typing it. However, these methods are error-prone and time-intensive.\n\nRadiologists from UC San Diego have developed software that automates the step, providing a rapid, and more efficient workflow while decreasing errors. The software automatically generates entire radiology study reports or sections of radiology study reports when provided with images from a radiology study which contain data stored as optical characters. The software recognizes optical characters in the radiology images and converts them from image into text, and subsequently sorts/formats/analyzes the data appropriately into a text file representing the radiology report.\n\nThe software is available as MATLAB 2014a code running on Windows 7 or 8, but software is easily ported or compiled and installed independently and is Mac compatible with appropriate compiling. Software includes a suite of programs, including:\n\n*   \u201cFlowScribe\u201d for vascular velocities and related data\n*   \u201cDexaScribe\u201d for bone density studies and related data.\n\nGenerally, all of the programs work by the following method: the images containing data are copied to the program either directly by the end user on a workstation, or on a server automatically. Once the programs have this image, they perform analyses to detect what type of image it is and additional error checking functions (i.e. are images from the same study?). Next, the programs convert image characters into text characters, and this data is stored in appropriate variables for subsequent sorting/manipulation of the data. The data can then be analyzed for trends, analyzed for clinically significant conditions (referenced to lookup tables), and/or used to generate radiology reports.\n\nFeatures of this software:\n\n(1)Decreases the time required for interpretation of radiology studies as well as for the creation of radiology reports. This will translate to increased study throughput and improved quality of life for radiologists, which are valuable.\n\n(2)Avoids errors related to human conversion of this data (i.e. transposition errors, incorrect decimal points, incorrect units).\n\n(3)More efficient that storing the data in image format (resulting in 75x more efficient storage, in developers\u2019 experience).\n\n(4)Allow for automated harvesting of data stored in archived studies, which is not possible by other means currently.\n\n(5)Provides \u2018decision support\u2019 to radiologists (as well as clinicians and patients reading reports), alerting them when values are abnormal or require additional attention.\n\n(6)Can be as used as either standalone software by radiologist end users, or it can be integrated into a server software package which takes DICOM or other radiology study images.",

    "ip_description": "Given here is a non-Turing Machine architecture for computer hardware capable of solving non-polynomial time problems in polynomial time.  Typically, with each added bit of input complexity, a computational system must grow in complexity in an exponential fashion.  For instance, two input bits give four possible bit states (00, 01, 10, 11) but 3 input bits give eight possible states, and 4 input bits give 16 states.  This quickly scales with 8 bits giving 1,024 possible bit combinations and in the case of RSA encryption, 2,048 bits gives\u2026 (I\u2019m not exactly sure, but it\u2019s a lot!) \nRather than approach computing in the traditional brute-force approach, memory elements are integrated into the logic, yielding much simpler circuits which operate in both a forward and reverse mode until a satisfactory solution is reached, yielding an equilibrium state for a given design.  In this way, traditionally non-polynomial time problems can be solved with polynomial circuit implementations and much faster computing is possible.",

    "ip_number": "25744 / UC Case 2016-056-0",
    "published_date": "07/03/2018",
    "ip_description": "Offered here is a new method to cost-effectively batch produce consistent, high-quality, high-yield Tip-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) Probes.  Using a bath process, SiO2 AFM probes are selectively coated with a dense size-ordered-layer of engineered nanoparticles, providing a high resolution & high sensitivity probe tip that exhibits reproducible enhancement from one tip to the next.  Unlike current state-of-the-art (evaporative coating, wire-etching or top-down construction) the current tip is both reliable and predictable in its performance.  Leveraging this new method for TERS Probe production, the full potential for TERS imaging should be realized at cost effective prices.  \nThe given method improves upon current approaches in several aspects: \n1) The process uses superior materials. As opposed to bulk metal wires or deposited metal films, the method herein uses size and shape controllable nanoparticles. These particles are single crystalline, nearly-atomically flat and are advantageous over deposited or etched materials which have shapes that are uncontrollable on the nanoscale, are rough and polycrystalline. \n2) Because the fabrication process is independent of the size or shape of the nanoparticles used, this method succeeds in engineering the desired size and shape of nanoparticle for a given probe, allowing precise tuning of the antenna\u2019s performance to meet experimental criteria.  \n3) The combination of high quality materials and tunability has led to reproducible enhancement factors in the range of 108-109 at a wavelength of 785 nm. This compares to most etched metal or evaporation coated tips which are generally in the 106-107 range. \n4) This is a batch process. Many of the existing fabrication techniques have single-tip throughput. Thus far, this method has demonstrated up to 10 simultaneously fabricated tips, made in 3-5 hours, with a greater than 80% yield. It should be noted that fabricating 50 or 100 tips would add little to no extra time to the process.\n\nExperiments to date using a silicon-tipped Atomic Force Microscope, enhanced with the above method, have yielded exceptional data at the nm scale.  There are several markets today which would benefit from broader availability of TERS, the largest of which is the semiconductor industry. TERS can give information about dopants, stress/strain, material composition, crystal orientation, and other properties of semiconductor and solid state devices that are unobservable with other current techniques. \nThere are many interesting biological questions that can be addressed with TERS as well. There has been a publication suggesting TERS can be used to sequence DNA. It may also be useful for looking at cell membrane composition and dynamics, as well as many other potential biological applications. \nThe TERS tips developed under this research have proven easy enough to use, that anyone currently operating an AFM should be able to perform TERS successfully. They should also be affordable enough to become consumables in the price range of research labs. \nThis technology should help bring TERS technology to the broader market.",
