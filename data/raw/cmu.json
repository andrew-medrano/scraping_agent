    "published_date": "Mar 13th, 2024",
    "ip_description": "Recent advancements in 3D printing technology have allowed the rapid fabrication of functional parts with complex geometries. Despite this progress, significant challenges remain in printing parts with precise internal features that span multiple length scales, as required for biomedical and medical devices, industrial components, artistic products, and other applications. The traditional 3D printing process involves printing the positive geometry. Although this approach works well for a wide range of shapes, it is inefficient to print mostly solid forms with minute intricate channel-like features such as those commonly encountered in vascularized engineered tissue, 3D microfluidic devices, complex mechanical systems with embedded cooling channels, or pneumatic actuators for soft robotics. The layer-by-layer deposition of positive geometry can result in considerable print times and produce an often-undesirable stepping pattern in the final printed part. In contrast, we propose 3D printing the negative geometry in a frozen state, casting the positive ink, and subsequently eliminating the negative ink to produce the desired form. This process can tremendously reduce processing times and increase production resolution (and thus the manufacturing capability) for structures with internal openings (channels, etc.), primarily when those openings cover a smaller volume than the solid part of the components. Using a high-resolution 3D printing process such as ink-jetting allows printing intricate negative geometries. Traditional 3D inkjet printers typically deposit droplets of specially formulated UV-curable inks cured using an overhead UV lamp. This top-down curing of the ink precludes the printing of overhang structures without support material. Instead, we propose inkjet printing with a liquid (e.g., water, camphene) that will freeze in situ when printed, forming the negative geometry ink. The freezing process can be created by a cold platform or a cooled chamber or both. This technique enables support-free high-resolution fabrication of the negative \"ice\" template. Note that \"ice\" is used as a general term to indicate the frozen state of the printed ink and is not only limited to frozen water. After casting and solidifying the surrounding material (which would form the solid portion of the final component), the sacrificial ice is removed through sublimation, melting, or chemical dissolution, with minimal disruption to the encapsulating positive form. The use of non-toxic and environmentally friendly sacrificial inks, such as water, as the negative ink makes this technology especially attractive for biological and medical applications where the biocompatibility of the ink is an essential consideration.This 3D printing technology revolutionizes the fabrication of parts with complex geometries by focusing on printing the negative geometry in a frozen state, a method that significantly reduces processing times and increases the precision of internal features. This innovative approach allows for the support-free, high-resolution creation of intricate designs, particularly benefiting sectors requiring detailed internal channels, such as biomedical devices, microfluidic systems, and industrial components. Additionally, the use of environmentally friendly and biocompatible materials like water for the sacrificial ink enhances its applicability in sensitive applications, making it a groundbreaking solution that addresses the limitations of traditional 3D printing methods.Biomedical and Healthcare:\nVascularized Tissue Engineering: Creation of tissues with intricate vascular networks for improved organ and tissue regeneration.\nCustom Medical Implants: Fabrication of personalized implants tailored to individual patient anatomy.\nDrug Delivery Systems: Development of devices with complex internal structures for targeted drug release.\nMicrofluidics:\nLab-on-a-Chip Devices: Compact, efficient devices for diagnostics, drug discovery, and biochemical assays.\nOrgan-on-a-Chip Systems: Platforms that mimic physiological responses of organ systems for research and testing.\nAerospace and Automotive:\nLightweight Components: Production of parts with complex internal geometries for weight reduction without compromising strength.\nCooling Systems: Advanced cooling channels in engines and electronics for improved thermal management.\nConsumer Electronics:\nCompact, High-Efficiency Heat Exchangers: Enhanced cooling solutions for small, densely packed electronic devices.\nCustom Enclosures: Tailored enclosures with intricate designs for aesthetic and functional purposes.\nRobotics and Automation:\nSoft Robotics: Fabrication of soft pneumatic actuators with complex internal channels for more nuanced movements.\nCustomized Grippers and Connectors: Parts with specific internal geometries for optimized performance in automated systems.\nArt and Design:\nComplex Artistic Creations: Sculptures and artifacts with detailed internal and external geometries that are difficult or impossible to create with traditional methods.\nEducation and Research:\nEducational Models: Detailed anatomical models for medical and scientific education.\nPrototype Development: Rapid prototyping of research devices with complex internal features.",

The low-resolution depth data is more privacy preserving than conventional camera-based wrist systems. The device has the ability to estimate user upper body pose, detect held objects, and scan the environment for obstacles and contextual clues.Real-time tracking of a user\u2019s hands, arms and environment is valuable in a wide variety of human-computer interaction applications, from context awareness to virtual reality. Rather than rely on fixed and external tracking infrastructure, the most flexible and consumer-friendly approaches are mobile, self-contained, and compatible with popular device form factors (e.g., smartwatches).This invention enables imaging and estimating the pose of the hand, body, and nearby environment through multi-view depth sensing via a sensor band worn on the wrist. The sensing band is thin and self contained, in a form factor similar to a smartwatch strap. Arranging the orientation and position of depth sensors on the strap, allows for the ability to image different features of interest, such as the hand, torso, or environment.

    "published_date": "Jun 9th, 2023",
    "ip_description": "This technology overcomes previous limitations existing in spin-orbit torque (SOT) devices by performing deterministic switching of a magnetization state of a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (\u201cPMA\u201d) magnet using out-of-plane antidamping SOT in layered materials having low symmetry crystal structure without the need for an external biasing magnetic field.The out-of-plane antidamping torque in WTe2 is essential to explain the observed magnetization switching. Having a material that can switch magnetism without the need of an external magnetic field can lead to energy-efficient data storage and logic devices.Spin-orbit torque MRAM (SOT-MRAM) is a type of non-volatile memory technology that utilizes the spin-orbit interaction of electrons to read, write, and store data. Spin\u2013orbit torque (SOT)-driven deterministic control of the magnetic state of a ferromagnet with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is key to next-generation spintronic applications including non-volatile, ultrafast and energy-efficient data-storage devices.However, field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization remains a challenge because it requires an out-of-plane antidamping torque, which is not allowed in conventional spin-source materials such as heavy metals and topological insulators due to the system\u2019s symmetry. The exploitation of low-crystal symmetries in emergent quantum materials offers a unique approach to achieve SOTs with unconventional forms.This technology is a realization of field-free deterministic magnetic switching of a perpendicularly polarized van der Waals magnet employing an out-of-plane antidamping Spin-orbit torque (SOT) generated in layered WTe2 (tungsten ditelluride), a quantum material with a low-symmetry crystal structure. The numerical simulations suggest that the out-of-plane antidamping torque in WTe2 is essential to explain the observed magnetization switching. The way atoms are configured in WTe2 allows for an out-of-plane oriented spin current that in turn can be used to control the magnetization state of a magnet. Having a material that can switch magnetism without the need of an external magnetic field can lead to energy-efficient data storage and logic devices.Computing and Data Storage: The computing industry can benefit from SOT-MRAM in applications such as servers, data centers, and high-performance computing.

Privacy Label Wiz is integrated with XCode IDE. PLW scans iOS application source code locally on a developers device to identify the use of iOS permissions, present results to developers, and provide them with an interactive UI designed to prompt developers to carefully consider the functionality of their iOS application. With the analysis of source code and interactive functionality, Privacy Label Wiz helps developers to properly disclose the data practices of their application when creating a privacy label for their application on the Apple App Store.In December 2020, Apple began requiring developers to disclose their data collection and use practices to generate a \u201cprivacy label\u201d for their application. The use of mobile application Software Development Kits (SDKs) and third-party libraries, coupled with a typical lack of expertise in privacy, makes it challenging for developers to accurately report their data collection and use practices.In this work we discuss the design and evaluation of a tool to help iOS developers generate privacy labels. The tool combines static code analysis to identify likely data collection and use practices with interactive functionality designed to prompt developers to elucidate analysis results and carefully reflect on their applications\u2019 data practices. We conducted semi-structured interviews with iOS developers as they used an initial version of the tool. We discuss how these results motivated us to develop an enhanced software tool, Privacy Label Wiz, that more closely resembles interactions developers reported to be most useful in our semi-structured interviews. We present findings from our interviews and the enhanced tool motivated by our study.

In this architecture, autonomy components are allowed to fail while \u201csafety gate\u201d components uphold safety requirements. The safety architecture includes a reusable design pattern which can serve as a basis for the safe control of any robotic or other autonomous or semi-autonomous system, as well as any system that must be built as a composition of high dependability and low dependability components.A Safety Architecture for Autonomous Vehiclesdescribes an architecture for autonomous vehicles that incorporates arbitrary autonomy algorithms into a system that upholds strict safety requirements. In this architecture, autonomy components are allowed to fail arbitrarily, even maliciously, while higher-integrity (e.g., higher Safety Integrity Level) \u201csafety gate\u201d components, which might be built without the need for autonomy techniques, uphold safety requirements. A set of architectural stages is created based on a reusable architectural pattern for mapping, planning, and executing safe trajectories. Each stage includes a primary \u201cdoer/checker\u201d pair, and an optional secondary \u201cdoer/checker\u201d pair to provide a degraded mode of operation in case the primary pair fails. InA Safety Architecture for Autonomous Vehicles,\u201cdoing\u201d means performing autonomous control, while \u201cchecking\u201d means confirming that the control signals are safe to execute. If successfully applied, this doer/checker principle may be a suitable option for adoption by safety standards for building dependable systems.A Safety Architecture for Autonomous Vehiclesmay be implemented to realize one or more of the following potential advantages:The gap between complex autonomy algorithms and dependable software systems may be bridged by allowing autonomy components to be integrated into a high-dependability framework. Such framework may assure safe system operation even when individual components, such as autonomy components, fail in an arbitrarily bad manner (e.g., both accidental faults and maliciously unsafe behavior by an individual component).Fail-operational system-level behavior may be provided even when individual components fail or must be shut down due to unsafe component-level behaviors.Heterogeneous functional modules may be provided to reduce the chance of common mode failures, and degraded mode behavior may be provided to, for example, perform a safing mission when primary functionality fails.A Safety Architecture for Autonomous Vehiclesis general-purpose for application in any autonomous system including, without limitation, fully autonomous ground vehicles, semi-autonomous ground vehicles, air vehicles, and other robotic systems with complete or partial autonomy.The architectural pattern is additionally applicable to non-autonomy applications having a mixture of less-trustworthy components (e.g., off-the-shelf software components) and more trustworthy components (e.g., safety critical components).",

Subjects were imaged under 15 view points and 19 illumination conditions while displaying a range of facial expressions. In addition, high resolution frontal images were acquired as well. In total, the database contains more than 305 GB of face data. TheContentpage describes the database in more detail.A close relationship exists between the advancement of face recognition algorithms and the availability of face databases varying factors that affect facial appearance in a controlled manner.The PIE database, collected at Carnegie Mellon University in 2000, has been very influential in advancing research in face recognition across pose and illumination. Despite its success the PIE database has several shortcomings: a limited number of subjects, a single recording session and only few expressions captured.To address these issues researchers at Carnegie Mellon University collected the Multi-PIE database. It contains 337 subjects, captured under 15 view points and 19 illumination conditions in four recording sessions for a total of more than 750,000 images.Labels are provided for a total of 6152 images of Multi-PIE. Illumination images were captured by recording 20 images within 0.7 seconds with flashes firing one by one. Due to the minimal subject movement between the different flash images the labels could be copied across all illumination conditions. These are AAM-style labels with between 39 and 68 feature points depending on the pose which were determined manually. Here is an illustration for the points labeled for the frontal view.The collection and structure of the Multi-PIE database along with results of baseline recognition experiments have been described in two research papers:Gross, R., Matthews, I., Cohn, J.

This method allows for self-refining games whose dynamics improve with play, ultimately providing realistically rendered, rich fluid dynamics in real time.The advantage of this analytics-driven training approach yields lower model error and fewer visual artifacts than a heuristic training strategy. Additionally, by analyzing sample player data and identifying the most likely states, precomputation efforts can be prioritized on data that will have the greatest impact on user experience or system functionality. This ensures that the system is optimized for the scenarios that matter the most to users, leading to a more tailored and personalized experience.Data-driven simulation demands good training data drawn from a vast space of possible simulations. While fully sampling these large spaces is infeasible, in practical applications, such as gameplay, users explore only a vanishingly small subset of the dynamical state space. By concentrating precomputation around these frequently encountered states, computational resources can be allocated more efficiently. Rather than precomputing and storing data for all possible states, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, focus will be on the states that have a higher probability of being encountered. This targeted precomputation approach reduces the computational burden and optimizes resource utilization.This method is a sampling approach that takes advantage of this observation by concentrating precomputation around the states that users are most likely to encounter. This technique is demonstrated in a prototype self-refining game whose dynamics improve with play, ultimately providing realistically rendered, rich fluid dynamics in real time on a mobile device.

    "ip_description": "Our Functional Graphenic Materials (FGMs) may be applied in passive remediation of contaminated water. The technology includes at least six unique FGM scaffolds that incorporate a variety of metal-chelating groups, such as carboxylic acids, hydroxamic aciFGMs may also be applied directly to a water supply. Due to their insolubility, FGMs may be recovered along with the metals.Recent research supports FGMs having negligible impact on environmental microflora (e.g., experiments demonstrate minimal bactericidal effects on Escherichia coli, even at high concentrations).Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a pervasive source of metal pollution that severely impacts freshwater ecosystems and has a direct impact on human health. Conventional active and passive methods work very well for removing iron in AMD remediation, which is typically the highest metallic impurity. However, conventional passive remediation fails to remove all aluminum, which has severe ecological implications. Removal of aluminum ions using chelation, which traditionally uses small molecules that bind metals tightly for sequestration, holds promise. Yet, chelation strategies are limited because once introduced into surface water, small molecules are difficult to reclaim and often persist in the environment as pollutants.\n\nTo address limitations existing in previous chelation strategies, CMU researchers have designed six unique scaffolds based on functional graphenic materials (FGMs) to create non-soluble scaffolds that could be placed at the end of a passive remediation process as a polisher to remove persistent aluminum. When tested for efficacy, all six FGMs successfully demonstrated a reversible capacity to remove aluminum from acidic water, chelating up to 21 ug per mg FGM. Further, when exposed to E. coli as an approximation for environmental compatibility, viability was unaffected even at high concentrations, suggesting these FGMs to be non-toxic and a viable candidate for passive chelation-based remediation.Our\nFunctional Graphenic Materials (FGMs) can remove persistent metals such as\naluminum from acidic water (e.g., our research shows they are capable of chelating\nup to 21 \u03bcg of Al/mg of FGM).

Researchers have demonstrated that the nano-carriers not only exhibit increased foliar uptake, but may also translocate to different compartments of the plant.Nano-carriers may be adapted to release their cargo in response to changes in pH, which can be an indicator of disease in a plant.Nano-carriers may also be tailored to administer compounds in response to changes in temperature, which can assist in alleviating and managing heat stress in plants.Star polymers were developed with a poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) core and temperature-responsive poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)  (PNIPAm) shell. The core is negatively charged and can be loaded with a significant amount (~0.5g/g) of positively charged molecules (e.g. antibiotics with amine functional groups). The polymers are readily taken up into plants upon foliar application, translocated to different parts of the plant. Upon heating the plants, in this case to 40 C, the drug is released into the plant vasculature. The temperature at which this delivery occurs can be controlled by changing the composition of the shell. The type of drug to be loaded can be changed by changing the core composition. The overall goal is to be able to load the material into the plants, then have the drug release only when the plants are under heat stress. The released drug will allow the plants to survive that peak heat stress. Right now there are no available methods for this purpose.Nano-carriers\nallow for less wasteful application of agrochemicals, from both an economic and\nenvironmental angle.

However, successful oral formulations must overcome poor transport of large therapeutic molecules from the intestines to the bloodstream. Chemical permeation enhancers of the intestinal epithelial barrier have been identified, and some have entered clinical trials, but their translation has traditionally been hampered by cytotoxicity. This ongoing need inspired us to investigate food components as known non-toxic chemicals in the intestines, and their potential application as intestinal permeation enhancers. As a result, we have demonstrated that the strawberry pigment pelargonidin and some of its molecular relatives are effective, nontoxic enablers of oral biologic absorption (Figure 1).\n\tPelargonidin and its molecular family, the anthocyanidins, are aglycone (sugar-free) versions of the anthocyanin pigments commonly found in wines, fruits, vegetables, and many flowers. The general structure (Figure 2a) comprises the three-ring flavylium cation with substitutions of \u2013OH or \u2013OCH3 groups at different combinations of the denoted \"R\" sites. In an intestinal cell culture screen of six anthocyanidins, three members of this family increased drug permeability across tissue, with pelargonidin (Plrgn) performing particularly well (Figure 2b). These findings underscore the importance of this particular molecular structure, and the potential for application of additional, effective compounds within the anthocyanidin family.\nWe have further demonstrated that pelargonidin can be used to enable oral delivery of insulin, a 5.8 kDa protein, in mice (Figure 3a). Impressively, the oral combination of pelargonidin and a one unit per kilogram insulin dose provided a sustained decrease in blood sugar, amounting to 140% of the total drug activity when compared to the current gold standard of subcutaneous injection. Additionally, we showed that pelargonidin improves uptake of the linear polymers 40 kDa and 70 kDa dextran (Figure 3b). This implies that this system can be applied to bioactive polymers (including heparin) and nucleic acids (including siRNA). To this end, because the permeation enhancer strategy of oral macromolecule delivery is not dependent on the drug chemistry, anthocyanidins have the potential to orally deliver a broad range of current biologic drug candidates without further chemical development.\nOral delivery of large molecules.",

    "ip_description": "Rare words are extremely common in any language. Yet, natural language processing tools that use deep learning methods to generate words---including machine translation, summarization, dialogue and personal assistants, question answering, speech recognition, speech translation, and others---generate words by sampling from a pre-defined, closed output vocabulary. This is done by computing scores for each candidate word and normalizing them to probabilities using a \"softmax\" layer. Since softmax is computationally expensive, current systems limit their output vocabulary to a few tens of thousands of most frequent words, sacrificing linguistic diversity by replacing the long tail of (millions) rare words by the \"unknown\" word token. Unsurprisingly, at test time this leads to an inferior performance when generating rare or out-of-vocabulary words. Despite the reduced output vocabulary, softmax is computationally the slowest layer. Moreover, its computation follows a large matrix multiplication to compute scores over the candidate words; this makes softmax expensive in terms of memory requirements and the number of parameters to learn.\n\nWe developed a new technique to generate low-dimensional continuous word representations, or \"word embeddings\" instead of the softmax layer. We train sequence-to-sequence models with continuous outputs by minimizing the distance between the output vector and the pre-trained word embedding of the reference word. At inference time, the model generates a vector and then searches for its nearest neighbor in the target embedding space to generate the corresponding word. This general architecture can in principle be used for any language generation task that uses sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses word embeddings---rather than the softmax layer---as outputs in language generation tasks. While this idea is simple and intuitive, in practice, it does not yield competitive performance with standard training approaches that use cosine or Euclidean distance. A major innovation in our work is a novel probabilistic distance function to train the proposed model. We experimented with neural machine translation. In translation of two language pairs, into two languages, our translation systems perform on par with the state-of-the-art systems in terms of translation quality, while attaining up to 2.5x speed-up in training times, and 98% reduction in memory requirements for the output layer. These models are also capable of handling very large vocabularies without compromising on translation quality. The proposed architecture and the novel probabilistic loss have the potential to benefit broadly applications which have sequences as outputs. Our new loss function could be used as an objective function for problems which currently use cosine or Euclidean distance, such as learning word embeddings. Since the outputs of our models are continuous (rather than class-based), these models can greatly simplify training of generative adversarial networks for sequences.",

We explore three aspects of the problem in the context of finding small faces: the role of scale invariance, image resolution, and contextual reasoning.\n\nWhile most recognition approaches aim to be scale-invariant, the cues for recognizing a 3px tall face are fundamentally different than those for recognizing a 300px tall face. We take a different approach and train separate detectors for different scales. To maintain efficiency, detectors are trained in a multi-task fashion: they make use of features extracted from multiple layers of single (deep) feature hierarchy. While training detectors for large objects is straightforward, the crucial challenge remains training detectors for small objects.We show that context is crucial, and define templates that make use of massively-large receptive fields (where 99% of the template extends beyond the object of interest).\n\nFinally, we explore the role of scale in pre-trained deep networks, providing ways to extrapolate networks tuned for limited scales to rather extreme ranges. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on massively-bench-marked face datasets (FDDB and WIDER FACE). In particular, when compared to prior art on WIDER FACE, our results reduce error by a factor of 2 (our models produce an AP of 82% while prior art ranges from 29-64%).\n\nPlease read our paper that describes this intellectual property in detail at:https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04402\n\nVisit our project website at:https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~peiyunh/tiny/",

The advantages of this type of modulator is that it may be integrated with RF MEMS devices and components on chip and also be scaled to high operational frequencies.\nUnlike present technologies among strain-based modulators, which primarily operate by launching a surface acoustic wave to interact with the optical cavity, this device makes use of laterally vibrating piezoelectric resonators. This design may be used to promote denser integration on chip, and be utilized in a variety of technologies for RF-Photonic applications that incorporate MEMS resonators and photonic integrated circuits. Also, in contrast with other types of optical modulators that involve physical displacements, the present design has an advantage in that its function does not significantly degrade if the device dimensions are modified to operate at a higher frequency due to the strain-based operation. \nThis offers a more reliable interlace for electrically-controlled optical modulation in acousto-optic devices. The invention has been tested experimentally. The demonstration has been made with a monolithic AIN device of 400 nm thickness, but the design may be configured to operate at different frequencies in a variety of piezoelectric materials.",

Analyses of attrition and learning in MOOCs both point to the importance of social engagement for motivational support and overcoming difficulties with material and course procedures. A help seeking intervention has been developed to address these limitations.\nThe intervention is designed to support help seeking as well as increasing the probability that help requests will be met with a satisfactory response. While virtually all MOOCs offer threaded discussion affordances where students can post help requests, some students are reticent to ask for help, and even when students do post help requests, many of these requests go unanswered.\nhttps://github.com/DANCEcollaborative/forum-xblock\nA major limitation of the current generation of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is a lack of opportunity for students to make use of each other as resources.

    "ip_description": "Face alignment is the problem of automatically locating detailed facial landmarks across different subjects, illuminations, and viewpoints. Previous methods can be divided into two broad categories. 2D-based methods locate a relatively small number of 2D fiducial points in real time while 3D-based methods fit a high-resolution 3D model offline at a much higher computational cost.\n\nOur approach exploits dense 3D cascade regression, where the facial landmarks are consistent across all poses. In our system the face is annotated completely in 3D by selecting a dense set of 3D points (shape). Binary feature descriptors (appearance) associated with a sparse subset of the landmarks are used to regress projections of 3D points. The method first estimates the location of a dense set of markers and their visibility, then reconstructs face shapes by fitting a part-based 3D model. The method was made possible in part by training on the BU-4D Facial Expression and BP-4D-Spontaneous datasets that contain over 300,000 high-resolution 3D face scans. Because the algorithm makes no assumptions about illumination or surface properties, it can be applied to a wide range of imaging conditions. The method was validated in a series of tests. We found that 3D registration from 2D video effectively handles previously unseen faces with a variety of poses and illuminations. Our implementation runs at 50 fps using a single core of an i7 processor, enabling real-time performance.\nThe software provides facial expression transfer, that enables real-time and person independent avatar animation.\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb61CmsPq_I\nPaper: http://www.laszlojeni.com/pub/articles/Jeni15FG_ZFace.pdf\nFace alignment is the problem of automatically locating detailed facial landmarks across different subjects, illuminations, and viewpoints.

In doing so, the method improves video search efficiency, accuracy & effectiveness. The novel concept adjustment model is a key value proposition. The adjustment increases the consistency of the video representation with the ground truth concept representationThe method can scale up multi-media semantic search (audio and visual) while maintaining state of the art video search performance within a fraction of a second.Video is one of the most popular communication tools today. The ability to search complex events in video based on text queries in large scale without using any video metadata such as titles, human provided keywords or video captions is largely unmet; large-scale content-based semantic search in video is a fundamental problem in multimedia analysis and retrieval. Videos shared may have either no text or only a few words with little relevance to the visual content. Current methods include searching user-generated metadata, often text-based (e.g., titles, descriptions, captions). These methods are unscalable, slow, inconsistent and index videos based on raw concept detection. This technology addresses these long-standing challenges to improve video search experiences through understanding the meaning that lies in the video content. Researchers at CMU have built a system to label videos automatically with textual representations, in a very large scale, for effective search and retrieval.Advances the text retrieval method for video retrievalSupports video summarization, visualization, search & recommendationsScalableto big data collections required for real world applicationsUses a single CPU coreFast-It only takes 0.2 seconds on a single CPU core to search a collection of 100 million internet videosFree of user-generated metadataZero example search (0Ex) -does not require thousands of example videos to detect multimedia events. 0Ex resembles a real-world scenario in which users start the search without any exampleIncreased accuracydue to use of concept adjustment & concise optimization frameworks with interpretationsMulti-media search & recommendations, including mobile or desktop library video searchEnterprise workplace content searchingContent-based semantic search among workplace video files/folders, HR video onboarding/training etc.Supporting law enforcementSearching content circulating on social media involving concepts deemed illegal.In-video advertisingEnabling advertisers to better place ads based on video content and concept occurrences.Education TechnologyContent-based semantic search, recommendations & video summarization of educational videosHealthcare/Bioinformatics",

    "ip_description": "QUADS is a decision support framework that takes advantage of automatic question answering (QA) technologies to automatically understand and process a decision representation, and produce a final decision by gathering and weighting answers to individual questions using a Bayesian learning and inference process. First, it introduces a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation for decision processes, which allows decision makers to formulate and organize natural language questions or assertions into an analytic hierarchy, which can be evaluated as part of an ad hoc decision process or as a documented, repeatable analytic process. Then, the decision process is mapped to a Bayesian decision representation, to jointly model the entire decision scenario (including the users' preferences, assertions from QA systems, and hierarchical decision factors) in a unified model. The QUADS framework was implemented as an open source software package, with wrappers for Apache UIMA1 and the CSE framework to support: a) integration of any QA system deployed as a UIMA Aggregate Analysis Engine, and b) configuration, optimization and extension of the QA system with various decision synthesis strategies.\nhttps://github.com/ziy/quads",
