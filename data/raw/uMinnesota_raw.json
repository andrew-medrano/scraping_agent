    "ip_description": "A sound exciter is the vibrating component of a loudspeaker that can be attached to a solid surface to create sound reproduction in virtually any location. In particular, multiple exciters can be combined to create loudspeakers or haptic displays. A wide variety of exciter types are available for purchase, but very little design guidance is available from manufacturers or any common source (outside of highly technical research papers and bespoke consultants). End users, then, are left to play a guess-and-check game with parameters such as exciter type, number, location, and size of exciters, material type, etc. when optimizing a speaker or tactile/haptic design. Prof. David Anderson at the University of Minnesota has developed end-user software to simulate a speaker or haptic display based on a wide range of exciter parameters. This software allows users to experiment with different exciter types, quantities, and distributions as well as the material of the surface to be excited among other parameters. There is currently no comparable end-user software available. End-user binary code is made available for personal and consulting use. Source code will be made available for integration and distribution to platform design software packages.",

    "ip_description": "Fast-growing cancers require increased bioenergy production. Metabolic plasticity enables cells to switch between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to sustain this energy requirement. Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) play critical roles in sustaining this plasticity, especially during tumorigenesis and metastasis. MPC is responsible for transporting pyruvate into the mitochondria, while MCT1 is involved in the transport of lactate and pyruvate across cellular membranes. Their role in cancer energetics makes them ideal pharmacological targets.\n\nResearchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel compound MN-D7.Tris that has excellent pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties and is suitable for clinical translation. For example, MN-D7.Tris is highly potent in low nM for mitochondrial pyruvate inhibition, water soluble (> 10 mg/ml in water), metabolically stable (~ 4 hrs) in mice, 100% orally bioavailable in mice, well tolerated in mice and suppressed Triple Negative Brest Cancer tumor growth efficiently (~ 79%) as a single agent. The dual inhibition of MPC and MCT by this compound disrupts both mitochondrial energy production and the transport of key metabolic intermediates, offering significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders.",

Traditional opioid medications, while effective at managing pain, come with severe side effects, including the risk of addiction and overdose. Attempts have been made to address these problems with non-opioid agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and local anesthetics, however insufficient pain relief greatly limits their clinical impact. As a result, there is a critical need for safer and more effective pain management strategies. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed novel puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA) inhibitors that have analgesic properties. By targeting the inhibition of PSA, enkephalin degradation is reduced, leading to increased levels of endogenous opioid peptides in the body, which offers increased pain relief and a promising alternative to traditional opioid therapies. This solution avoids opioid receptor overstimulation, thus dependence and addiction are avoided.",

However, technical hurdles such as the computational management of dropout events, the reconstruction of biological pathways, and the isolation of target cell populations have not been fully resolved yet. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel program called Dpath that can successfully address the dropout events, quantitatively assess the cellular states, and prioritizes genes for both progenitor and committed cellular states. This post processing software constitutes a powerful tool for biologists interested in cellular differentiation. Unlike existing software, Dpath uses metagene entropy to rank cells based on their differentiation potential. Dpath uses the self-organizing map (SOM) and the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithms to separate the progenitors from the differentiated cells and reconstruct the lineage hierarchies in an unbiased manner. This software also resolves the problem of dropout events by using a weighted Poisson non-negative matrix factorization (wp-NMF) method. This novel software is easy to use, and provides fast and high resolution single-cell transcriptomics. The Dpath software is a valuable tool for developmental, stem cell and cancer biologists and can further discoveries in the biological mechanisms that govern stem cell and progenitor cell populations.",

Potential therapeutic for other cancers. Key Benefits & Differentiators: Increases survival: Use of Zika virus combined with formulated vaccines increases survival from 0% to 70% in a mouse model of brain cancer. Targets affected cell types: Zika virus has exhibited the capability to infect and kill neural stem stem cells and brain tumor stem cells. Comparatively mild side effects: Adults infected with zika experience relatively benign, non-permanent side effects (as compared to chemotherapy and radiation). Oncolytic viruses (the enemy\u2019s enemy): Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults and has a 5-year survival rate of only 5% even with aggressive treatment including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. This low survival rate emphasizes the need for new therapeutic approaches. One creative approach that has been extensively studied is the use of oncolytic viruses (including herpes simplex virus, measles, poliovirus, among others) in the treatment of cancer. Poliovirus has shown the most promise, but still leaves much to be desired with a 2-year survival rate of 29% in glioblastoma patients. In an effort to improve on this approach, researchers at the University of Minnesota have established that Zika virus combined with anti-cancer vaccinations is a promising new approach to treating brain tumors. Putting zika virus to work: Zika virus shows potential based on its ability to infect brain tumor stem cells in vitro. Additionally, recent evidence has shown that adults infected with Zika virus experience a relatively benign course of illness with fever, rash, joint pain, conjunctivitis, and some symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Considering the infectivity of Zika virus on glioblastoma stem cells and the mild host of symptoms associated with the infection, this therapy shows promise as a potential therapy for glioblastoma patients. Testament to this potential, use of Zika in combination with anti-cancer vaccinations (irradiated, zika-infected tumor cells + GM-CSF) in brain cancer mouse models, improved long-term survival from 0% to approximately 70%.

Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel colorimetric immunoassay for single pathogen detection with the naked eye. The presence of a single pathogen in the sample results in a chemical cascade reaction leading to a colorimetric shift from red to blue that is visible to the naked eye without specialized instrumentation.

However, the disease will eventually progress to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is a disease state responsible for nearly all prostate cancer deaths. 20-30% of CRPC patients have primary resistance to AR-targeted therapies, necessitating AR-independent therapies and prognostic biomarkers to identify said resistance for optimizing treatment regimes and designing efficient clinical trials. Previous studies have provided evidence for clinical utility of analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from plasma of men with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), with detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the cfDNA in particular associated with poor clinical outcomes. Commercial cfDNA assays are available for identifying patients with ctDNA, and detecting a subset of the genomic alterations that underlie CRPC-specific resistance mechanisms. However, there is an unmet need for cfDNA assays able to prognosticate outcomes in mCRPC patients, particularly in the context of AR-targeted therapies. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a liquid biopsy assay for predicting survival outcomes of mCRPC patients being treated with AR inhibitors. Specifically, this assay is a DNA sequencing assay for detecting ctDNA in plasma cell-free DNA with specific targeting of mCRPC-specific alterations. Out of 776 cfDNA samples analyzed, 324 cfDNA samples (~42%) were identified as ctDNA-positive using standard parameters measured by commercial DNA sequencing assays, while this new assay identified an additional 156 ctDNA-positive samples. This represents a 20% increase in sensitivity by accounting for mCRPC specific alterations. This additional information can also be leveraged to adapt treatment plans.",

Although most ovarian cancer patients will respond to initial treatment with surgery and chemotherapy, the majority relapse with chemoresistant disease. Metastasis is a major contributor to disease progression and death in these patients. Tumor cells use cell-cell adhesion to adhere to other sites or form cell-cell aggregates that are resistant to chemotherapy and migrate into the vasculature. By blocking these adhesions, it may be possible to limit or block cancer metastasis.

However, these networks are typically trained in a supervised manner, requiring a large database of fully-sampled (reference) data at the desired resolution, which is often impossible to acquire.

With this approach, algorithms can be trained on existing databases of undersampled images (e.g. as in the case of the Human Connectome Project) or on a scan-specific manner. This novel approach is highly effective in scenarios where acquiring fully-sampled datasets are not available or impossible due to organ motion or physical constraints such as signal decay. When implemented in MRI or CT systems for image reconstruction, the scan time can be significantly reduced while improving the quality of reconstructed images without having to modify acquisition hardware.

    "ip_description": "A system and method for treating epilepsy and other neurological disorders by deep brain stimulation targeted to the EPN using ultrahigh field MRI. Approximately one-third of patients with epilepsy do not achieve freedom from seizures using anti-seizure medications. Of these patients, a minority are candidates for safe epilepsy ablative surgical procedures, and many patients who undergo these procedures will still have residual seizures after surgery. Electrical stimulation of neural structures is an alternative approach that can be performed to interfere with seizure generation. However, there are only 3 types of electrical stimulation using FDA-approved devices for epilepsy, and fewer than 20% of patients achieve complete seizure control with any of them. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel approach for treating epilepsy with deep brain stimulation that targets the endopiriform nucleus (EPN). The EPN has been shown to regulate cortical hypersynchronous excitability and the propagation of seizures, deeming it a relevant target for neuromodulation therapy for epilepsy. Use of ultrahigh field MRI enables high-resolution localization of the EPN, allowing electrode placement via stereotactic techniques. Deep brain stimulation of the EPN in a rodent model has shown a promising reduction in the duration and overall occurrence of seizures. This novel method could offer increased efficacy in the treatment of epilepsy patients while also providing improved neural visualization and surgical techniques that could be beneficial for other neurological disorders.",

    "ip_description": "Milk protein concentrates (MPC) and micellar casein concentrates (MCC) are milk-derived, high protein ingredients that are used in products like high protein beverages, bars, and yogurts due to their excellent nutritional quality. Processing these concentrates is challenging due to protein-protein interactions and higher calcium content in milk proteins resulting in their aggregation during storage and processing. Common existing approaches for processing these dairy proteins include mechanical methods such as high shear treatment or thermal processing, as well as nonmechanical treatments such as enzymatic or chemical modifications. These techniques lower the nutritional quality of the proteins as well as being complex and time intensive. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a method for processing dairy proteins using a pulsed electric field (PEF). This method allows for the customization of finished protein product characteristics towards improved processability through changes in viscosity and solubility while maintaining or marginally modifying the natural dietary and sensorial aspects of the proteins. The optimized PEF method results in significantly reduced processing costs via a reduction in viscosity while concentrating which leads to improved material throughput and energy efficiency. This technology can be easily added into existing processing lines, making integration straightforward. The optimized PEF processing method decreases costs associated with dairy protein processing without compromising on nutrition or taste.",

Following foliar-, soil-, or seed-based introduction, silica nanoparticles exposed to water release silicic acid that can be used by the plant, providing an essential source of silicon. However, to maximize plant benefits, a steady release of silicic acid is needed, rather than a single application, highlighting the need for improved delivery mechanisms. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed novel nanoparticles consisting of a polymeric core encased in a silica shell. Polymer-core swelling breaks the shell and generates small, high surface area silica fragments that serve as a continuous supply of silicic acid to plants. Unlike existing nanoparticle delivery strategies, these novel nanoparticles deliver silicic acid from the shell, leaving the core of the nanoparticle available for delivery of additional molecular cargo. The controlled fragmentation and dissolution of the silica shell ensures a continuous supply of silicic acid, offering a more efficient and sustained delivery system.",

The Cck-Cck1R pathway represents a therapeutic target for protecting the Purkinje cells against atrophy and death. It may be an effective treatment for patients suffering from ataxia as well as those at risk, even before symptoms occur. Currently, no treatments can prevent or slow ataxia, and any treatments that do exist merely aim to alleviate symptoms.

Cancer-derived EVs elicit an immune response that facilitates the use of approved checkpoint inhibitor therapies. Cancer EVs combined with checkpoint inhibitors completely eradicate colorectal tumors in xenografted mouse models. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer type in the U.S. and the second and third leading cause of cancer death in men and women, respectively. Unfortunately, the majority of CRC tumors are non-immunogenic, failing to produce a response from the immune system. This causes traditional therapies that target immune checkpoints to be ineffective for most CRC patients. To solve this problem, researchers at the University of Minnesota developed cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be injected into the patients, producing an immune response. This approach has the potential to increase the efficacy of immune checkpoint therapies in CRC patients. Since many CRC tumors suppress the immune response and do not respond to immune checkpoint therapy alone, the current primary treatment is surgery and chemotherapy. Unfortunately, 55-75% of CRC patients exhibit metastasis, making this approach of limited efficacy. As an alternative, the developed method uses cancer-derived EVs to increase T-cell infiltration and two major immune checkpoint factors (PD-1 and CTLA-4) at the tumor site. Mice receiving this EV treatment showed increased CD28 levels on T cells (required for T cell stimulation) in tumor-draining lymph nodes and increased sensitivity to traditional immune checkpoint inhibitors. These results provide in vivo proof of concept that this strategy will be an effective treatment approach in previously unresponsive CRC populations.",

    "ip_description": "A targeted therapeutic delivery system utilizing glycoengineered mesenchymal stem cells for reduced toxicity and increased treatment residence time. Effective treatment of most cancers is plagued by the delivery of toxic amounts of therapeutic agents to healthy, non-cancerous tissues. Furthermore, retention of therapeutic agents is limited, requiring repeated and frequent administration. Targeted delivery of diagnostic agents and drugs to tumors can improve detection and treatment outcomes. Nevertheless, currently available options suffer from a lack of selectivity for tumor cells. Ligand-based targeting attempts to exploit the fact that tumor cells overexpress specific membrane proteins that can be targeted with appropriate antibodies or ligands. However, it has become increasingly clear that many, if not most, of these proteins are expressed in normal cells as well. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a two-step targeting approach that leverages the introduction of synthetic targets in the tumor tissue, followed by the delivery of agents that have a high affinity for these targets. By glycoengineering mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), the tumoritropic nature of MSCs can be leveraged to localize unnatural azide groups by a targeted tumor. The subsequent reaction of these azide groups with alkynes such as dibenzyl cyclooctyne (DBCO) allows for bioorthogonal copper-free \u201cclick\u201d chemistry.

CD133 has also been found to be expressed on cancer stem cells from tumor tissues. Current reagents (such as AC133) predominantly identify only glysosylated epitopes of CD133. Therefore, lack of AC133 immuno-positivity may not always be synonymous with the lack of CD133 protein.

The device consists of three stacking reservoirs: The top reservoir is filled with wash buffer, the middle holds the immunoblot membrane(s) to be washed, and the bottom collects liquid waste. Wash buffer flows from the top reservoir into the middle reservoir, and used buffer from the middle reservoir flows into the bottom (waste) reservoir. Placing the device on a rocking/rotating platform (such as those already found in most labs) provides continuous agitation during the wash process. Furthermore, the outlet aperture diameter in both the wash buffer and membrane compartments can be adjusted so that the liquid either drips or flows continuously, and an adjustable flange in the membrane compartment helps control the depth of the wash buffer in the container. Standard membrane washing protocols generally depend on lab personnel to manually discard and replace wash buffer solutions in between a series of relatively short (~5-10 min) incubation periods on an agitating platform. Commercial efforts toward optimizing this work flow have relied on expensive pump-driven buffer exchange machines. This device provides a low-cost, non-mechanical solution that both streamlines and automates immunoblot membrane washing in labs already equipped with a mechanical rocking platform. This device is also easily disassembled for cleaning, which is critical in eliminating cross-contamination.

    "ip_description": "A blood-based panel for diagnosing and tracking glioblastoma to improve patient outcomes. Glioblastoma is the most malignant form of cerebral gliomas and accounts for 17% of all primary brain tumors. Despite recent advances in the multimodal treatment of glioblastoma, the prognosis of it is still poor, with a median survival time of 12.1\u201314.6 months after diagnosis and a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. Glioblastoma is mainly diagnosed through neuroimaging techniques (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computer tomography (CT) scans) and tissue samples, but they all have limitations. Tissue biopsies are invasive and can only offer a snapshot of tumor evolution at a single time point. Biopsies are high risk procedures that can lead to brain swelling and hemorrhages. Additionally, repeated surgery and sampling in order to define the real molecular profile of the tumor progression is not feasible. Moreover, the lack of accessibility to some brain tumors hampers obtaining tissue samples. Imaging modalities are insufficient to distinguish true tumor progression from treatment artifacts that mimic progression; they are also expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an unmet need for non-invasive, practical and flexible approaches for clinical management of glioblastoma. Prof. Okay Saydam at the University of Minnesota has developed a serum-based panel for glioblastomas. This panel was developed by analyzing the transcriptomic signature of serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) from 85 primary glioblastoma patients and comparing the results to 31 healthy donors\u2019 EVs. This approach identified several significant dysregulated markers which are highly sensitive and specific predictors in patients with wild-type IDH1 status detected in tumor tissues, MGMT promoter methylation in tumor tissues, and mutations in the p53 gene detected in tumor tissues.

Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed new allosteric CDK2 inhibitors that bind outside the ATP site, leading to significant structural changes that prevent CDK2's association with its cyclin partners. These inhibitors have been optimized through structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, resulting in highly potent nanomolar inhibitors. This breakthrough offers a targeted approach for cancer chemotherapy and a novel non-hormonal method for male contraception.",

    "ip_description": "A method of phase alignment in large antenna arrays to improve scalability with low power consumption. In radar and communications systems there are a number of advantages to moving to systems with more and more antennas. One such advantage is that you can adjust the signal for each antenna in order for the signal to add constructively and destructively such that you can steer the signal in certain spatial locations while minimizing it in others. This concept applies to both transmitted signals and received signals. Traditional approaches rely on a central, global optimization approach to adjust the individual antennas. However, when the number of antennas significantly increases (into the hundreds) for large-scale radar systems or 5G/6G sub-Terahertz wireless communications, the calibration overhead is large from a computational perspective as well as from a power perspective. This limits adoption of large scale phased arrays because of the high cost and low efficiency. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a method to calibrate large scale phased arrays by syncing the antennas locally to the adjacent element. This method provides background phase tuning and self-alignment between adjacent sources via a nearest-neighbor interferometric approach. By eliminating the need for interaction with a central control, antennas are adjusted faster and with lower power requirements. Additionally, this approach can be applied to both transmitters and receivers. Increasing the scalability of large scale phased arrays at decreased cost can enable the adoption of the technology in both military radar and communications (5G and 6G).",

    "ip_description": "Non-Cartesian implementation of a self-supervised physics-based deep learning reconstruction without fully-sampled data. Several machine learning (ML) methods are being developed to improve regularized reconstruction in a multitude of inverse problems, especially in computational medical imaging (e.g. MRI, CT). Some of the most successful methods use a physics-based ML reconstruction approach, wherein the reconstruction is performed by \u201cunrolling\u201d an optimization algorithm into a neural network that alternates between a regularizer unit and a data-consistency unit. However, these networks are typically trained in a supervised manner, requiring a large database of fully-sampled (reference) data at the desired resolution, which is often impossible to acquire. On the other hand, training using lower-resolution reference data has not been effective in reconstructing higher-resolution data. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel approach for self-supervised training for physics-based ML reconstruction in inverse problems, without requiring a database of fully-sampled data. With this approach, algorithms can be trained on existing databases of undersampled images (e.g. as in the case of the Human Connectome Project) or on a scan-specific manner. This novel approach is highly effective in scenarios where acquiring fully-sampled datasets are not available or impossible due to organ motion or physical constraints such as signal decay. When implemented in MRI or CT systems for image reconstruction, the scan time can be significantly reduced while improving the quality of reconstructed images without having to modify acquisition hardware. Additionally, the researchers have implemented this approach using non-cartesian trajectories for denser sampling of echo times. The researchers have shown that the performance of the Cartesian trajectory method to be similar to that of supervised approaches that are trained with fully-sampled reference and the non-Cartesian implementation show high spatiotemporal resolution with meaningful BOLD analysis.",

Effects on corn and soybean yields are most severe, with reports finding yield losses as high as 91% in corn, 68% in soybean, and 54% in cotton. For these reasons, prevention of _A. palmeri_ establishment is a high priority, with several states that experienced large crop loss requiring the certification of any amaranth type seed as Palmer amaranth-free. Mature Amaranthus plants share enough morphological characteristics to be confusing for non-experts to identify and morphological identification of _A. palmeri_ seeds from seeds of related Amaranthus spp. is even more challenging. The difficulty of both field tissue and seed identification led to a demand for genetic testing to identify _A. palmeri_ against other Amaranths. Existing tests were validated against a much more limited representation of Palmer Amaranth genetic diversity. Additionally, existing tests are limited to testing 50-100 seeds at a time due to insufficient sensitivity. Thus, there remains a need for methods of genotyping Amaranth that have improved sensitivity and can detect rare alleles in mixed genetic pools. Researchers at the University of Minnesota and Colorado State University have co-developed a method and kit for identifying _Amaranthus palmeri_ plant material using genetic markers. This method and kit were developed by examining a comprehensive genotyping-by-sequencing dataset from the largest and most genetically diverse panel of _Amaranthus_ populations sequenced to date. This test is able to detect a single palmer Amaranth seed in a pool of at least 200 Amaranthus species with a sensitivity ranging from 99.8 to 100%, and a specificity ranging from 99.59 to 100%. The accuracy for all three tests is >99.7%.

Researchers at the University have developed inhibitory nucleic acid molecules targeting and suppressing cyclin D1 mRNA expression, presenting a therapeutic approach to address the challenges posed by liver diseases. This innovative technology leverages a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between cell cycle regulation and metabolic pathways. Cell proliferation necessitates metabolic reprogramming to accommodate the biosynthesis of new cell components, a phenomenon mirrored in cancer cells. Cyclin D1, a pivotal cell cycle regulator often overexpressed in many cancers, exerts profound effects on biosynthetic metabolism, as revealed through studies on hepatocyte proliferation. Cyclin D1 broadly promotes biosynthetic pathways, including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and purine and pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis in hepatocytes. Furthermore, proteomic analyses indicate that cyclin D1 binds to numerous metabolic enzymes, activating key enzymes in glycolysis and de novo pyrimidine synthesis.

Traditional mouse models, while valuable in many research contexts, have revealed significant limitations in studying SARS-CoV-2 due to disparities in receptor binding affinity.

Human APOBEC family members are important mediators of adaptive and innate immune responses. One family member, apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G (A3G)), was identified as a cellular protein capable of blocking the replication of virion infectivity factor (Vif)-defective HIV-1. A3G inhibits the replication of HIV-1 and other retroviruses by deaminating viral cDNA cytosines to uracils during reverse transcription. Naturally occurring cytosine deaminases such as human APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F are prone to aggregation and precipitation, especially at high concentrations. This prevents researchers from utilizing cytosine deaminases as a tool in screens for potential inhibitors of HIV-1, which is responsible for 95% of HIV cases worldwide. The HIV therapy market is expected to grow to $45 billion in 2028 at a CAGR of 5.9%.

    "ip_description": "A novel technique to improve MRI image fidelity via the combination of a denoising and deep learning-based reconstruction. The conventional computational imaging pipeline in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) either involves a linear reconstruction followed by denoising or a non-linear reconstruction that \u201cjointly\u201d denoises and reconstructs from sub-sampled datasets, e.g. based on deep learning (DL). The former offers interpretability about noise components that have been removed following linear reconstructions, for which noise distributions are well-characterized. However, the overall performance is inherently tied to the linear reconstruction, which limits the acceleration rates that can be achieved, compared to state-of-the-art physics-driven DL (PD-DL) techniques. On the other hand, the latter approach of using non-linear reconstruction combines denoising and reconstruction, and offers little interpretability into what components have been removed and also has potential to over-regularize, especially for low-SNR acquisitions, leading to blurring and a loss of fine details. Thus, a synergistic combination of conventional denoising algorithms with interpretability and non-linear reconstruction methods with superior artifact reduction is desirable. To tackle this challenge, we reimagine this computational imaging pipeline to perform denoising on the acquired undersampled images for commonly used undersampling patterns and then perform non-linear PD-DL reconstruction on these data with improved and more uniform SNR. The demonstration of this idea on high-resolution 7T 0.5mm isotropic functional MRI (fMRI) data shows substantial improvement over existing computational MRI approaches.

Nano- and micro-based nanocarriers, including nanoparticles, bacteria, and viruses, are commonly used to improve drug stability and transport. However, nanocarriers face limitations like poor blood-brain barrier penetration and liver clearance. Cell-mediated drug delivery systems, using cells like red blood cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and stem cells as carriers, have emerged as a promising solution.

    "ip_description": "A device and method for simulating a digestive gut to evaluate drug delivery that incorporates simultaneous absorption with dissolution. Drug development is a billion-dollar activity and early selection of drug candidates and formulations with the required pharmaceutical properties could help reduce these costs. Solubility is a key property when developing a potential drug because it limits absorption and bioavailability. The standard USP dissolution test, which is intended and most frequently used for quality control, is neither optimal nor satisfactory for determining the efficacy of drug formulations in vivo, for two reasons. First, the system is closed with respect to the released drug, and any effects of drug absorption, which will tend to lower drug concentration and hence reduce the rate of precipitation, are suppressed. Second, analytical techniques (e.g. HPLC) usually do not distinguish between free drug and nano-sized drug aggregates or drug that is complexed to the excipient polymers. While free drug is available for intestinal absorption, nano-aggregated or complexed drug probably is not. The analytical technique may significantly overestimate the ability of a formulation to provide drug in a supersaturated, highly bioavailable form. This combination of limitations results in the underestimation of drug efficacy and the overestimation of bioavailable drug. Therefore, there is a need for better systems and methods of dissolution testing of drug formulations that are accurate, efficient and inexpensive. Prof. Siegel and his team at the University of Minnesota have developed an artificial gut simulator (AGS) for more accurate and efficient dissolution testing. The AGS improves on standard USP dissolution tests by simulating drug absorption using a hollow fiber-based absorption module with large surface area and in-line monitoring. Together, these improvements provide a more representative assessment of drug formulations in vivo. The entire AGS is constructed in a 3 mL compartment, which reduces cost and waste associated with the standard dissolution test which takes place in a 1 L compartment. The simplicity of the AGS system and the need to use only a small volume and mass of the dissolution media and drug formulation, respectively, allows its applicability to screen solutions, suspensions and solid powder formulations such as amorphous solid dispersions in a high-throughput, cost-efficient, manner. The AGS has been demonstrated with a high aqueous solubility, BCS-I model compound caffeine and a poorly water-soluble, BCS-II model compound, ketoconazole.

Thin film deposition is an important manufacturing step in the production of semiconductors, consumer electronics, medical devices, and wearables. Traditionally, the functional materials used in these devices are grown on commercially available substrates using various thin-film deposition techniques. However, the use of these rigid substrates severely limits the flexibility of the thin films. Previous work has demonstrated that by using a sacrificial layer during synthesis, the thin film can be separated from the substrate and deposited on structurally and chemically incompatible surfaces. Nevertheless, existing sacrificial layers are complex in structure and require a difficult growth process, reducing their practicality and utility. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel method to synthesize and deposit perovskite oxide membranes onto a substrate of interest by using a sacrificial layer that dissolves upon contact with water. After removing the sacrificial layer, the free-standing perovskite oxide thin film can be transferred to the desired host substrate. This technique utilizes a simple binary oxide sacrificial layer and requires no extra tools or materials beyond what is typically used for this type of thin film growth. The high thermal stability of the binary oxide sacrificial layer prevents cation intermixing at high growth temperatures. Lastly, this sacrificial layer does not contain aluminum which can be problematic due to its ease of oxidation.",

While X-ray diffraction (XRD) combined with phase retrieval methods enables imaging of the thin film's atomic structure layer by layer, existing approaches are costly and time-consuming. The necessity for substantial synchrotron X-ray diffraction data significantly restricts their practical application. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a structure modeling and refinement software to compute the film structure using a novel algorithm. It employs an innovative constrained phase retrieval algorithm to resolve depth variations within thin film structures.

Ethylene is industrially produced through the steam cracking of petroleum hydrocarbons and typically contains traces of acetylene impurities. Transition metal polymerization catalysts commonly used in polyethylene production are highly susceptible to poisoning and deactivation by acetylene, thus its removal is of paramount importance. Currently, this is accomplished via the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene into ethylene by a palladium catalyst. However, this reactivity requires high pressures which are not only energy-intensive and costly but can also have a detrimental effect on polymer quality. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel method to selectively combust acetylene in a mixture of other combustible hydrocarbons. A metal oxide catalyst is used in conjunction with oxygen to selectively oxidize acetylene. This technology avoids the safety challenges of simultaneously feeding oxygen and hydrocarbons together at high temperatures. Instead, the metal oxide catalyst is employed in successive reduction/oxidation cycles to achieve selective acetylene combustion.",

Almost all industrial operations, whether they are food and beverage manufacturers, chemical industries, or refineries, generate wastewater that needs to be treated to remove contamination. Organic contaminants, such as those present in brewery wastewater at high concentrations, can become valuable resources with waste-to-energy systems. Anaerobic microorganisms can be utilized to convert complex biopolymers into methane which can be used to produce energy, but current approaches are energy-intensive due to the requirements of microbial separation or retention via membranes or specialized reactors. For these reasons, alternative approaches are required for bacterial retention in wastewater treatment applications. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed an encapsulated supported anaerobic biofilm that can process wastewater with decreased energy requirements, and the method to make said encapsulated biofilms. By encapsulating the anaerobic bacteria, the bacteria are retained in the bioreactor without the need for membrane separation. The encapsulated biofilm produces on average 27 times more methane than encapsulated platonic bacteria. A two-stage reactor is utilized first to break down the organic compounds and then to generate the methane, resulting in a modular approach that can also be applied to the generation of other byproducts, including hydrogen gas. Pilot studies have been conducted with brewery and dairy wastewater demonstrating stable (>3 days) performance with >90% COD removal within <4 weeks of startup and stable performance of encapsulation chemistry (<15% 3-day moving average) over a > 30-day period.",

This protocol enhances the homology-directed repair (HDR) rate by 8-fold, leading to a significant reduction in the number of clones needed for screening. By reducing the time required for gene editing, the protocol enables completion in as little as 8 weeks from start to finish. A series of optimization steps improves nucleoporation efficiency and cell survival, resulting in higher recombination rates. CRISPR-based gene editing has gained popularity because it offers significant advantages in creating specialized cell lines for disease modeling. However, its use in CRISPR gene editing of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) is inefficient resulting in high cell death, low recombination rates, and long recovery times for surviving cells. iPSCs, with their versatility in modeling various biological processes, underscore the urgent need for more efficient CRISPR protocols tailored specifically to this cell type. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a CRISPR-based editing protocol specifically designed for human iPSCs, resulting in an eight-fold increase in the homology-directed repair (HDR) rate. This advancement significantly reduces the number of clones needed for screening and shortens the gene editing process to just 8 weeks, three times faster than current commercially available solutions. The protocol achieves higher recombination rates through optimization steps that improve nucleoporation and cell survival, involving the inhibition of p53 and optimization of commercially available gene editing reagents. Notably, this protocol does not require specialized equipment, making it easily adoptable by industry and academic labs seeking to create disease-relevant cell lines with knockout or knock-in mutations to test novel therapies or study disease processes.",

    "ip_description": "A superconducting quantum device for scalable and gate tunable realization of the Josephson diode effect. Quantum computing has received tremendous attention in recent years and is expected to grow significantly due to the promise of exponentially faster computing and fundamentally new computing approaches. One of the major drivers behind this growing industry is the high degree of versatility that quantum computing can offer across many industries. The Achilles heel of quantum computers is decoherence (loss of information), which occurs at a rapid rate and prevents the scaling of the number of qubits. One approach for increasing the coherence time is the use of topologically protected qubits, which have well-separated states akin to digital in comparison to analog. To date, there has not been a compact and/or practical approach, e.g. avoiding the use of exotic materials, for doing this. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a superconducting quantum device for scalable and gate tunable realization of the Josephson diode effect which may serve as building blocks in designing topologically protected qubits. The three-terminal device is based upon InAs quantum well two-dimensional electron gas proximitized by epitaxial aluminum and exhibits diode efficiency that can be tuned by a small out-of-plane magnetic field and electrostatic gating. Researchers have further shown that this diode effect is a generic property of multi-terminal Josephson devices, making this technology material agnostic and therefore scalable and amenable to standard fabrication approaches relative to existing technologies that rely on exotic materials. The use of standard materials and fabrication approaches is expected to result in increased reliability and efficiency while providing longer coherence times in a compact device configuration. Additionally, this device could be used for neuromorphic circuits and AI because it enables nonlinear intermodulation and rectification of multiple signals and the ability to electrostatically tune the weight of each of these signals.",

    "ip_description": "Effector T cells show promise in immunotherapy, but their efficacy is hindered by the progressive loss of mitochondrial structure, function, and cell metabolism, directly contributing to T cell exhaustion and therapeutic failures. Currently, there are no clinically viable strategies to prevent mitochondria-mediated exhaustion and to enhance effector T cell function. This gap in clinically viable strategies not only hampers the effectiveness of immunotherapies but also prolongs treatment duration, increases costs, and exacerbates the risk of adverse side effects. As a result, there is an urgent need for clinically viable strategies that can address these challenges and unlock the full therapeutic potential of effector T cells in combating disease. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a clinically viable strategy for preventing mitochondria-mediated exhaustion and enhancing effector T cell function. This approach focuses on inducing tetrameric pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (tet-PKM2) using the TEPP46 agonist, regulating gene expression, whole genome methylome, and metabolome while boosting CD8 T cell effector functions both in vitro and in vivo. TEPP46 treatment upregulated key genes linked to mitochondrial biogenesis and structure, leading to denser cristae, increased mass, and improved interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum. Metabolomics studies showed a redirection of glucose-derived carbon flux, enhancing mitochondrial metabolism and effector functions. In preclinical melanoma and colon cancer models, TEPP46 treatment significantly delayed tumor growth and altered the tumor immune-environment with increased infiltration of activated CD8 cells having higher mitochondrial mass. These findings highlight the clinical promise of targeting PKM2 to enhance effector T cell activation, prevent exhaustion, and improve outcomes in immunotherapy.",

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) stand as leading causes of blindness and low vision in the United States. The conventional treatment for these conditions involves direct intraocular injection of anti-VEGF antibodies. However, this treatment method presents challenges, including the need for recurrent injections and a significant percentage (\u223c40%) of patients not responding adequately to therapy. Consequently, there is a pressing need for novel therapies that surpass or complement current approaches. Such innovations would greatly benefit patients, particularly those who remain refractory to anti-VEGF treatment options. Researchers from the University of Minnesota have developed a first-in-class drug lead candidate, A229, for potential treatment of ocular diseases. A229 targets Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), a ligand-activated transcription factor that is involved in lipid metabolism of various tissues. Previous studies have shown that PPAR\u03b1 agonism significantly reduces the progression of DR, but currently available drugs that target PPAR\u03b1 suffer from low affinity and lack selectivity among PPAR subtypes. A229 exhibits good potency and subtype selectivity for PPAR\u03b1 when assessed in a commercial primary luciferase-based cell assay. In human retinal pigment epithelial (hRPE) cells under conditions that model DR, A229 upregulates PPAR\u03b1 target genes, improves cell viability, reduces VEGF production, and protects against ROS production, aligning with PPAR\u03b1 agonism expectations in a disease-relevant context.

The emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which are not susceptible to current antibiotics has necessitated the development of novel approaches and targets to tackle this growing challenge. Bacterial two-component systems play a central role in the adaptive response of bacteria to their ever-changing environment. They are linked to antibiotic resistance and bacterial virulence making the proteins of the TCSs, histidine kinases (HKs), and response regulators, attractive for the development of novel antibacterial drugs. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed maleimide-based compounds, PMI-1\u201320, which were evaluated for potency in vitro and in silico. Compounds that inhibited HK autophosphorylation and disrupted bacterial signaling emerged as promising leads. These leads were further examined for their ability to impede Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) virulence. PMI-1, 2, 3, and 5 showed efficacy in reducing staphylococcal hemolytic activity and were then assessed through cytotoxicity assays using A549 cells. PMI-5, chosen because it had no cytotoxic effect on A549 cells, demonstrated a 25% decrease in staphylococcal invasion of A549 cells. In a mouse model of S. aureus skin infection, PMI-5 significantly reduced bacterial lesion size by 65% and slightly decreased bacterial burden in the infected skin by 10%. Taken together, these data support that PMI-5 shows promise for diminishing bacterial virulence in vivo. Importantly, these compounds function as anti-virulence agents, potentially lowering the evolutionary pressure for bacterial resistance. These compounds could serve as adjuvants with existing antibiotics or as standalone therapies, enhancing the immune response against bacterial infections.",

    "ip_description": "A novel method for the streamlined synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant small molecules via 5-membered metal-bound heteroarynes. Cyclic compounds containing oxygen and nitrogen are essential building blocks for a host of chemical compounds found in nature. Due to their widespread presence throughout biochemical pathways, they are also of extreme interest for applications in many important pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The decoration of these heterocycles with different functional groups is critical to alter their chemical properties such that they can be tuned for a particular end use. However, functionalizing these compounds can be difficult and require multiple synthetic reactions. Although methods exist for the functionalization of these heterocyclic compounds, this has largely been limited to reactions that add one substituent at a time. To address this, aryne intermediates have been investigated and shown to offer a solution to enact one-pot difunctionalization. However, this methodology has previously not been applicable to 5-membered heteroarynes containing nitrogen and oxygen which is a common motif found in drug molecules. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel method for the synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant small molecules via a transition metal-bound heteroaryne intermediate. By using transitional metal catalysts, 5-membered heteroaryne intermediates previously thought to be inaccessible have been synthesized and used to illustrate the proof of concept in performing one pot difunctionalization reactions of 5-membered heterocycles. This technology unlocks the utility of 5-membered nitrogen-containing heterocycles to perform late stage functionalization and derivatization that can help streamline drug discovery.",

    "ip_description": "Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH), a severe form of Alcohol-induced Liver Disease (ALD) resulting from excessive alcohol consumption, poses a major medical challenge due to limited treatment options and a high 30-day mortality rate exceeding 30%. Inflammation, driven by cytokines like TNF\u03b1, is at the core of AH's pathogenesis, leading to liver damage. Approximately 35% of individuals with alcohol use disorder face the risk of developing AH, marked by intense inflammation and liver failure. Recent pharmacological advancements have introduced agents targeting transcriptional mediators within super-enhancer pathways, linking TNF\u03b1 with chemokine amplification in AH. Notably, (Bromodomain and Extraterminal) BET proteins, particularly Bromodomain and extraterminal domain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), have emerged as key players in controlling chromatin architecture and super-enhancer activity, making them attractive treatment targets for AH. However, the clinical application of BRD4 inhibitors is hindered by toxic side effects, highlighting the urgent need for selective BRD4 inhibitors to improve AH treatment. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed BRD4-selective protein inhibitors for AH treatment in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic. One bromodomain inhibitor, UMN627, was tested in animal models of AH where it reduced liver CXCL production and neutrophil infiltration. Cleaved caspase 3 levels, a measure of liver injury and fibrogenesis, were also decreased in animals treated with UMN627. UMN627 selectively targets transcriptional mediators within super-enhancer pathways that are crucial for mediating TNF\u03b1-stimulated liver inflammation. The inhibitor preferentially binds to BRD4's bromodomain 1 (BD1), minimizing interactions with other proteins. In general, compared to pan-BET inhibitors, more-specific BET bromodomain inhibitors are anticipated to offer the advantage of causing fewer side effects while maintaining similar BRD4 inhibition, thereby demonstrating the commercial potential of these BRD4-selective inhibitors, and UMN627 in particular, as potential AH treatments.",

Lake water clarity, commonly determined by how far one can see in a water, is a widely used indicator of the physical, chemical, and biological health of the lake. However currently used techniques suffer from the following limitations: 1) data sampling is limited to one or two locations on a few lakes (i.e. poor sampling resolution), 2) labor intensive and expensive\u2013 requires an individual to boat to locations to collect samples and take measurements, and 3) optical variability of lake system limits the accuracy of the measurements to the locations they are collected.

Using imagery obtained from the Sentinel 2 satellites and an image processing algorithm, this method can accurately calculate water clarity data with higher spatial resolution when compared to existing techniques. In addition, after each weekly flyby, the satellite imagery can be analyzed to provide the most up-to-date information (i.e., high temporal resolution). Moreover, this method automatically accounts for the change in seasons, lighting conditions, and cloud coverage to produce accurate water clarity information. Furthermore, this method can be used to collect and estimate water clarity information for large geographic regions and can be used to create useful maps of geospatial patterns and temporal trends.

Pre-existing TCR transgenic mouse models require substantial time to generate, have random TCR genomic integration, and use non-physiologic promoters that may alter T cell functionality and hinder direct TCR comparisons. For these reasons, new mouse models are urgently needed to study physiological antigen-specific T cell behavior. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed T Cell Receptor Exchange (TRex) mice, in which TCRs, specific to the self/tumor antigen mesothelin (Msln), are integrated into the Trac locus, with concomitant Msln disruption to circumvent T cell tolerance. High affinity TRex thymocytes undergo all sequential stages of maturation, express the exogenous TCR at DN4, require MHC class I for positive selection, and undergo negative selection only when both Msln alleles are present. By comparison of TCRs with the same specificity but varying affinity, Trac targeting improves the functional sensitivity of lower affinity TCRs and confers resistance to T cell functional loss. By generating P14 TRex mice with the same specificity as the widely used LCMV-P14 TCR transgenic mouse, the researchers demonstrate the increased avidity of Trac-targeted TCRs over transgenic TCRs, while preserving physiologic T cell development. The TRex mouse model is an advanced tool for studying physiological antigen-specific T cell behavior.",

Epithelial ovarian cancer (OVCA) presents a significant clinical challenge due to its high mortality rate and resistance to standard treatments in many patients. Often diagnosed in advanced stages, OVCA patients who initially respond to platinum-based chemotherapy often experience recurrence and develop resistance to multiple drugs. Efforts to improve treatment outcomes have led to the investigation of targeted therapies such as bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Clinical trials have shown promising results when bevacizumab is added to platinum-based chemotherapy, leading to its FDA approval for OVCA treatment. Unfortunately, only a subgroup of patients benefit significantly from bevacizumab, whereas most patients benefit moderately or do not benefit at all. Currently, no molecular tests are available in clinical practice for predicting patient responses to platinum-based chemotherapy and/or treatment with bevacizumab. Therefore, personalized treatment approaches are urgently needed to address the variability in OVCA patient responses and to optimize outcomes. Using clinical and molecular tumor characteristics in patients, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a prognostic molecular test for predicting ovarian cancer patient response to platinum-based chemotherapy and/or treatment with bevacizumab. Based on the predicted patient response to platinum-based chemotherapy and/or bevacizumab, this test enables physicians to tailor treatment plans to individual patients, stratifying patients who will significantly benefit from treatment from patients who will only suffer from associated toxicities. This test integrates gene expression levels of key biomarkers, including MFAP2 and VEGFA, and clinical data such as FIGO stage, ECOG performance status, and post-removal tumor size to ensure a comprehensive disease state assessment and provide an accurate predicted treatment outcome. Complex predictive modeling, including Cox models and risk scoring, calculates the patient's risk of recurrence and guides treatment plans, including the optimal combination of therapies. By facilitating a comparison of the potential benefits of different treatment plans, this test aims to enhance overall survival rates and improve the quality of life for ovarian cancer patients. With its potential to meet the growing demand for precision medicine, this test holds promise to advance ovarian cancer treatment.",

    "ip_description": "In the pursuit of secure and unclonable encryption key generation, SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) cells have emerged as an exceptional candidate. Their unique, random, and unclonable nature, stemming from inherent process mismatch among transistors, makes SRAM an attractive choice. However, the primary challenge facing SRAM-based key generation has been its susceptibility to instability in the presence of random noise, temperature variations, voltage fluctuations, and device aging. To address this challenge, Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a data remanence based approach known as the Data Remanence Technique. This innovative approach simplifies the identification of stable SRAM cells for reliable key generation by reducing testing time and hardware requirements. Unlike previous methods, such as Temporal Majority Voting (TMV), which are resource-intensive and time-consuming, the Data Remanence Technique only requires two remanence tests, simplifying the process. It works by initially writing the entire SRAM array with '1' or '0', followed by a momentary power shutdown until a few cells flip. The technique leverages the fact that the cells that are easily flipped are the most robust cells when written with the opposite data, offering a unique and efficient solution for stable key generation. Experimental studies demonstrate that the 256-bit keys generated using this approach from a 512 kbit SRAM exhibit 100% stability under varying conditions, including temperature fluctuations, power ramp-up times, and device aging. The Data Remanence Technique is an innovative solution for secure key generation, leveraging the inherent unpredictability of SRAM cells to ensure that encryption keys remain resilient despite external challenges, ultimately safeguarding critical data assets.",

    "ip_description": "Novel fluorinated molecules for temperature sensing by MRI thermometry. Hyperthermia is a promising, but experimental modality for the treatment of cancer. This treatment relies on precise thermal ablation of tumor cells while leaving healthy tissue unharmed. An accurate and non-invasive method to measure deep-tissue temperature changes is essential to ensure accurate and precise targeting of the thermal application. Currently, this measurement can be done via proton (1H) MRI-based thermometry because all tissue contains a substantial amount of water. However, this method is susceptible to error, low sensitivity in fatty tissues, and requires a reference for absolute temperature determination. To overcome these issues, fluorine (19F) MRI thermometry has been investigated as an alternative. This is an attractive method due to the absence of mobile fluorine in the human body and therefore a background-free spectrum can be acquired. However, there are concerns with the utility of current perfluorocarbon compounds for this application due to their low sensitivity and environmental persistence. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed new highly fluorinated compounds for application in magnetic resonance-based temperature sensing. These compounds exhibit increased temperature responsiveness over previous generations of perfluorocarbon compounds and exhibit a twofold increase in sensitivity compared to proton-based MRIs. Moreover, they contain fewer alkyl fluorine groups than previous perfluorocarbon reagents and are less of an environmental concern because of their partial degradation in UV light. Since these compounds are a liquid at room temperature, they can be loaded into nanoparticles and used as a MRI-based temperature sensor. When fully developed these compounds have the potential to expand the use of hyperthermia to deeper organs that are currently not suitable for treatment with this method.",

    "ip_number": "2021-250",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "In post-quantum cryptography, ring-learning with errors (R-LWR) is a computational problem utilized to build new cryptographic ciphers that resist quantum-computing attacks. Modular multiplication of long polynomials with large coefficients is the most critical operation in these ciphers, and the complexity of these operations drives significant energy consumption. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a new method for integrating modular reduction into Karatsuba polynomial multiplication. Using this complexity reduction method, modular reduction is applied to intermediate segment products instead of the final product. As a result, additional sub-structure sharing is enabled, and the number of coefficient additions needed for assembling the segment products to get the final result is substantially reduced. For polynomial multiplications with decomposition factors 2, 3, and 4, this method reduces the number of additions by 13-17%. This innovative method optimizes the performance of R-LWR-based ciphers and other cryptographic systems reliant on polynomial multiplication. By integrating modular reduction into Karatsuba polynomial multiplication, this method achieves significant efficiency gains while ensuring continued security and resilience of these encryption techniques in the face of quantum computing threats.",

    "ip_description": "A blood test for detecting ovarian cancer with over 90% accuracy by monitoring key protein levels. When ovarian cancer is detected early, the survival rate is high. Unfortunately, existing blood tests are neither sensitive nor specific enough to screen women for ovarian cancer. By determining the levels of 92 cancer-related proteins in the blood of women with ovarian cancer compared to healthy women, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a test for ovarian cancer detection. The researchers tested the blood of more than 400 women and identified four proteins (CA125, HE4, ITGAV, and SEZ6L) that, when combined, successfully detected over 90% of the women with ovarian cancer. Subsequently, 700 additional blood samples were tested, and the combination of the four proteins successfully distinguished the majority of the blood samples from women with both early and late stage ovarian cancer compared to healthy women. The inclusion of the proteins HE4, ITGAV, and SEZ6L improved the sensitivity and specificity of CA125 alone for detecting ovarian cancer in serum samples. This test shows commercial potential as a sensitive and specific blood test for detecting ovarian cancer.",

    "ip_description": "A set of machine learning algorithms to enable hyper personalization of online learning. The Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) provided by learning platforms such as edX, Coursera, and Udacity have changed the educational landscape across the globe. While they offer numerous advantages over conventional education in regards to time, place, cost, accessibility, etc, these platforms face various issues. First, MOOCs currently offer a one-size-fits-all system. From learning content to taking tests, MOOCs today largely resemble linear, classroom teaching where learners fit within predetermined parameters that leave little room for individualization. Second, communication and information diffusion in MOOCs is limited, and thus the emergent learner behaviors are difficult to observe. Third, the overwhelming number of courses provided by the online learning platforms results in an overload of information for the learners, often leading to confusion, unproductive browsing, frustration, and dropouts. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a set of machine learning algorithms that can enable hyper personalization of online learning. By leveraging rich learning behavior data generated through learners' interaction in existing MOOC platforms, the researchers have developed models to predict student performance and their interest trajectory, and make recommendations accordingly. The Relation-aware self-attention model for Knowledge Tracing (RKT) is a recurrent neural network layer that incorporates the contextual information that integrates both the exercise relation information (through their textual content as well as student performance data) and the forget behavior information. The Student Interest Trajectory-based Recommendation (SITRec) models the dynamic nature of student interest, thread contents, and course structure using two recurrent neural networks. Deeper understanding of a student\u2019s interest and behavior using these models enable course content and thread recommendations that are individualized to the student\u2019s evolving needs. This set of algorithms can be used for providing a better personalized online learning system that keeps students engaged. In addition, this service can help the teachers to understand the different behaviors of learners enrolling in their courses. In the current online learning system, instructors are unaware of the behaviors of different learners such as, if they are facing difficulties on a particular course topic. This set of algorithms can help the teachers by notifying them the popular behaviors of learners enrolled in their courses.",

    "ip_description": "Novel alpha2-adrenergic agonists with neuroprotective and/or analgesic properties. These analogs can potentially slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's disease. These analogs can potentially provide a non-opioid alternative for managing chronic pain. These analogs lack affinity for adrenoreceptors, resulting in fewer side effects compared to their parent compound. The observed synergy between these analogs themselves and with morphine suggest the potential to achieve effective pain relief with lower opioid dosages. As human lifespans continue to extend, the prevalence of diseases linked to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, such as Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s disease, continue to increase. This trend is particularly evident among individuals aged 65 and older in the United States, with approximately 6.7 million Americans living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and at least 1 million diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s Disease. Concurrently, the challenge of chronic pain persists, exacerbated by the addictive and diminishing efficacy nature of many opiate-based analgesics. Current estimates suggest that over 2 million Americans are addicted to prescription pain relievers. These reasons underscore an urgent need for innovative therapies that are both more efficacious and possess fewer adverse effects, addressing the complexity of treating neurodegenerative diseases and chronic pain. The FDA-approved drug Guanabenz acetate (marketed as Wytensin\u2122), originally used as an antihypertensive agent, displays neuroprotective and analgesic properties. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed novel Guanabenz and structurally similar analogs. These analogs effectively retain the neuroprotective and analgesic properties of the parent compound, while eliminating any sedative and respiratory side effects, thus significantly improving their therapeutic window. The introduction of these structurally-related analogs presents a promising avenue for treating neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein aggregation, for which viable therapeutic options remain scarce. Moreover, their inherent analgesic properties position them as a potential treatment for chronic pain, devoid of the dependency issues associated with existing treatments. These analogs demonstrate a notable synergy among themselves and also with morphine, suggesting a potential strategy for reducing opioid dosages when used in tandem. Collectively, the attributes of these analogs hold the potential to address two critical health challenges both within the United States and around the globe.",

    "ip_description": "A bromodomain-targeting degrader of CECR2, an epigenetic regulator that drives cancer metastasis. Metastasis is the major cause of cancer-related deaths due to the lack of effective therapies. Emerging evidence suggests that certain epigenetic and transcriptional regulators drive cancer metastasis, either of which could be targeted as a therapeutic strategy. CECR2, a class I bromodomain-containing epigenetic regulator, has recently been identified as a requirement for breast cancer metastasis in mouse models. CECR2 increases the expression of metastasis-associated signaling molecules, and the deletion or inhibition of CECR2 prevents metastasis, suggesting that it is a promising target for anti-cancer therapy. Targeted protein degradation is an emerging technology that can be used for modulating the activity of epigenetic protein targets. However, very few degraders have been reported for class I bromodomain-containing proteins such as CECR2, demonstrating an unmet need. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed first-generation degraders for class I bromodomain-containing proteins, including CECR2, based on two scaffolds derived from pyridazinone and pyrimidine-based heterocycles. Various exit vectors and linkers were evaluated to identify analogues that demonstrate selectivity for this class of bromodomains. An intracellular assay was used to demonstrate that these heterobifunctional molecules are cell-permeable, form ternary complexes, and can degrade nanoluciferase\u2212bromodomain fusions. As a first example of a CECR2 degrader, the pyrimidine-based analogues degrade endogenous CECR2 in a dose-dependent manner, with almost complete degradation at concentrations between 5 and 50 nM. These degraders could potentially provide a starting point to evaluate the effects of targeted protein degradation in cancer models, and they demonstrate commercial potential as anti-cancer therapeutics.",

    "ip_description": "A software platform that introduces a new mathematical language to aid musicians, composers, and researchers in exploring and analyzing rubato. Rubato, the art of manipulating musical note timings to evoke human emotion, currently lacks a rigorous framework for categorization and analysis. The problem with existing rubato analysis technologies is that they primarily focus on tempo changes and cannot thus precisely analyze and modify individual note timings. This limitation hampers the comprehensive understanding and analysis of rubato, as rubato involves not only overarching tempo variations but also precise modifications to note beginnings and endings. Additionally, current methods do not provide a rigorous mathematical framework to categorize and analyze different types of rubato across musical genres and geographical regions. This lack of a standardized approach makes it challenging to compare and study rubato techniques across different cultures and contexts. Furthermore, the lack of user-friendly software tools restricts the accessibility and ease of exploration for musicians, composers, and researchers, hindering the advancement and widespread adoption of rubato analysis. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a new software platform called Rubato4Rubato. This software uses a new mathematical language that allows musicians, composers, and researchers to explore and analyze rubato. By mathematically capturing and modifying individual note timings, Rubato4Rubato provides a comprehensive and intuitive approach, enabling users to delve into the nuances of rubato across different musical genres and geographical regions.

SWIS offers comprehensive details including work zone extents, activities, and other relevant information. Existing technologies in work zone traffic control face significant challenges. Manual tracking and evaluation methods are time-consuming and resource-intensive, relying on frequent field visits and inspections. Current systems also provide limited information to drivers regarding upcoming work zones. They may only display basic location information without details such as work zone extents, activities, or potential deviations. This lack of comprehensive information can lead to driver confusion, increased congestion, and safety hazards. Lastly, using current systems, detecting deviations from established work zone layouts can be challenging. Manual inspections may not happen frequently enough, allowing unplanned deviations to go unnoticed, which can compromise driver safety. Overall, these limitations highlight the need for a more automated, comprehensive, and efficient solution to address the shortcomings of existing work zone traffic control technologies.

    "ip_description": "A method utilizing fungal hyphae to degrade non-aqueous liquid phase in contaminated soil and groundwater systems. The potential value proposition for this technology would be application of naturally occurring fungi in both of these markets with the aimed-for benefit being remediation that continues with the growth of the fungi at the site using the oil as a food for propagation of the fungi. By utilizing the oil contaminant as a carbon source, the fungi population self-regulates and adapts to in-situ contaminant levels thereby maintaining contaminant remediation. In addition, utilizing the high pressure exerted at the tip of the growing fungal hypha, sites where contaminants are present in difficult to reach areas can be accessed and remediated. The oil displacement induced by branching fungi could also enhance oil recovery. Thus, at oil and gas drilling sites the same mechanism that enhances oil recovery can potentially reduce groundwater contamination. Non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) that include petroleum-based oils, trapped in stagnant or low permeability regions, such as dead-end fractures or rock matrices, are hard to remediate or recover because they are mostly inaccessible by groundwater flow. Hyphae of fungi are known to generate a tremendous turgor pressure on their tips and produce surfactants that allow them to navigate through small pores, air pockets, and even rock matrices in porous media. While such properties can be exploited to target biodegradation of trapped NAPLs or recovery of oils, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on how fungal hyphae can enhance the bioremediation or recovery of trapped NAPLs. University of Minnesota researchers, using microfluidic chip media, have demonstrated the active removal of NAPL by fungi and elucidated the bioremediation mechanism. Results show the active removal of NAPL by fungi within 40 hours. The fungal hyphae effectively penetrated water-oil interfaces and significantly enhanced the oil removal/recovery from low porosity regions via direct consumption and oil displacement induced by hydrophilic hyphae-aided push. The results of this study will provide insights into the use of branching fungi for the bioremediation and recovery of trapped NAPLs.",

Current injury mitigation strategy includes time-consuming preoperative examination (including medical history such as airway pathology, reflux, etc.) and planning, and heavy reliance on the experience of the healthcare professional. Anesthesiologists at the University of Minnesota have conceptualized a novel intubation device that navigates from the top of the mouth or the nose to a patient's trachea with the least amount of human guidance. Using the combination of computer vision and machine learning, this device will be able to crawl through the airways bypassing any natural as well as unforeseen/abnormal obstructions (such as epiglottis, blood clots, contusion, vomitus, etc.) By incorporating depth and spatial perception along with improved vision by means of widening the field of vision and capturing the relative anatomy, we postulate that an inexperienced operator can intubate efficiently and with ease. Better maneuverability would also reduce unfavorable hemodynamics such as tachycardia and hypertension from excessive pressure applied on the airway structures associated with laryngoscopy, making it more tolerable in patients with coronary artery disease.

Vaccines are important and effective preventive tools against infectious diseases. The efficacy of a vaccine depends not only on its antigen components, which are weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism that trigger an immune response but also on adjuvants. Adjuvants are compounds or substances added to a vaccine to stimulate and enhance the magnitude and durability of the immune response to the antigen components. Adjuvants have several benefits, including reducing the antigen amount per vaccine dose, reducing the number of vaccination sessions, and, at times, extending the half-life of the antigen, thereby indirectly improving its immunogenic power potency. Despite their clear benefits, few adjuvants have been included in vaccines due to safety and tolerability concerns. There is an urgent need for novel compounds with adjuvant properties that are safe and tolerable to improve vaccine efficacy against infectious diseases. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have identified benzimidazole-thiophene carboxamide compounds with NOD-2 agonist activity. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies led to the discovery of 4-(2-pentyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)thiophene-2-carboxamide and 4-(2-hexyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)thiophene-2-carboxamide as lead compounds with significantly enhanced potency.

To better predict skin toxicity when directly exposed to cosmetics, chemicals, or pharmaceuticals, significant efforts are ongoing to develop in vitro human skin models. However, human keratinocytes (skin cells) used as the building block of in vitro human skin models are short-lived in culture and are not readily purchasable from commercial vendors. Also, keratinocytes from skin donors of a preferred age, race, or sex are difficult to obtain because skin donation is highly variable and inconsistent, as the source is left-over skin from surgeries. For these reasons, immortalized keratinocytes and new methods for keratinocyte immortalization are urgently needed to develop in vitro human skin models for toxicity testing. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have engineered a new lentivirus that has demonstrated the ability to immortalize keratinocytes while retaining the ability to differentiate and form 3D skin epidermis. This lentivirus creates immortalized keratinocytes that would potentially be amenable to cosmetic, chemical, or pharmaceutical toxicity testing. The result is an unlimited and consistent supply of keratinocytes and the ability to create age, race, or sex-specific keratinocyte stocks. This technology would eliminate the variable and constantly changing skin sources and the extra time and cost required for extracting keratinocytes during surgery.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a devastating hereditary disorder caused by a defect in the hemoglobin gene that leads to sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymers that distort the shape of red blood cells. Despite contributing to a shortened lifespan, high infant mortality rates, and significantly reduced quality of life, treatment options for SCD patients are limited to four FDA-approved therapies that do not dramatically improve outcomes. While gene therapy has elicited considerable excitement, the need for bone marrow ablation and the high cost preclude broad application of this approach. Millions of SCD patients worldwide would benefit from new, affordable, and easily accessible therapies. Thus, new small molecule approaches are desperately needed, but the pipeline for identifying and validating new therapies is extremely limited.

This FRET-based assay leverages high-sensitivity fluorescence lifetime measurements that monitor the temporally stable HbS oligomers. In the lab, the assay demonstrated HbS oligomer sensitivity to known polymerization inhibitors and identified novel HbS oligomerization inhibitors that reduced hypoxia-induced impairment of sickle blood flow without increasing hemoglobin affinity.

This technology significantly reduces time and cost associated with manual annotation (i.e., detection and delineation) of tissue sample pathology slides often done by pathologists. The regression model developed here accurately predicts the percentage of cancerous epithelium within a sample, and a threshold is applied to reliably obtain a binary label of cancer vs. non-cancer sample. The gold standard for obtaining the ground truth to train a predictive model requires the manual annotation of ex vivo prostatectomy samples. Such manual annotations performed by trained pathologists are very time-consuming and prone to error due to subjectivity. The method described here automates the laborious process of cancer annotation, saving significant time while achieving cancer detection accuracy comparable to that of a trained pathologist. This automated cancer annotation algorithm uses colorimetric information obtained from more than one type of staining (including morphology, architecture, and pathologic state of tissue), thereby increasing its predictive accuracy. The ground truth used to train the predictive model is derived from manual annotation of samples at high resolution, which ensures high confidence in its accuracy.",

Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of hereditary diseases characterized by progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass. MD affects about 250,000 people in the United States. Regenerative medicine offers promise in the treatment of MD. However, the inability to derive transplantable skeletal muscle stem cells from wild-type pluripotent stem cells hinders this promise. New approaches are needed to turn pluripotent stem cells into a viable regenerative therapy for MD. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a method for generating teratoma-derived skeletal muscle stem cells with functional regenerative capacity. This method involves injecting pluripotent stem cells into an immunodeficient mouse, allowing one or more teratomas to form, and isolating skeletal muscle stem cells from one or more teratomas using a novel antibody cocktail. Following the injection of as few as 40,000 teratoma-derived skeletal muscle stem cells into a tibialis anterior muscle of diseased mice, approximately 80% of the muscle volume is reconstituted. Newly generated muscle fibers are innervated, express adult myosins, and significantly improve dystrophy-related force deficit and fatigability. Teratoma-derived skeletal muscle stem cells also contribute to quiescent muscle stem cells, enabling long-term maintenance of regenerated muscle and allowing muscle regeneration in response to subsequent injuries. This method for generating teratoma-derived skeletal muscle stem cells can potentially be used for regenerative therapy development and as a research tool for studying muscle diseases.",

Researchers at the University of Minnesota have genetically modified the bacteria strain, Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, which is an established plant endophyte.

The endophyte property reduces the potential for nitrogen loss, commonly occurring in conventional fertilizers.

These associations support plant growth and have also been reported in the literature to form in many other plant strains. Lastly, this modified endophyte was demonstrated in the lab to support the growth of an algae strain, Chlorella sorokiniana, which is unable to fix nitrogen and is used as a surrogate to mimic the interaction with higher plants.

Unfortunately, the overall size of the aperture increases and due to layout complexity there are increased losses that degrade performance. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a Fabry-Perot Cavity Antenna (FPCA) consisting of a source antenna and a Frequency Selective Surface (FSS). Critically, the FSS is a periodic arrangement of unit cells with slots that shape the near field radiation to increase aperture efficiency, which in turn increases higher antenna gain. Additionally, multiple aperture arrays split the beam (akin to a \u201clens\u201d) to generate \u2018virtual\u2019 beams. Essentially, this produces virtual antennas.

    "ip_description": "A combinatorial small molecule treatment that promotes differentiation and maturation of myotubes derived from pluripotent stem cells. Human pluripotent stem cells represent an attractive model system for studying various genetic diseases due to their ability to differentiate in vitro into various cell types of the body. This feature allows for studying disease mechanisms in vitro using patient specific induced pluripotent stem (PS) cells. One challenge encountered when using PS cell-derivatives to study diseases has been the tendency to produce embryonic, fetal, or generally immature forms of the terminally differentiated cell types desired (as reported for cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, and pancreatic cells). The lack of full maturation of terminally differentiated cells is an impediment to the application of PS cell-derivatives for recapitulation of disease phenotype and disease modeling. To address this challenge, researchers at the University of Minnesota conducted a small molecule screen for potential candidates able to promote differentiation/maturation of PS cell-derived myotubes. They identified the compounds SB431542 (S), DAPT (Da), Dexamethasone (De), Forskolin (F) and PD0325901 (P) as potent enhancers of maturation. Combinatorial treatment with S/Da/De/F resulted in myotubes with enhanced maturation, as evidenced by the expression profile of myosin heavy chain isoforms, and the upregulation of genes related with muscle contractile function. Together, treatment with these compounds generates muscle cells that could be used to study skeletal muscle function and screen for possible therapeutic compounds in a more physiologically relevant state.",

There is not yet a widely deployed vertical axis wind turbine, although it potentially can exhibit benefits such as simple design, low spatial footprint, and easy maintenance due to the fact that the generator is at the base which also lowers the risk for birds. The challenges in current vertical-axis wind turbines are mainly due to their inefficiency in terms of the power output vs. wind speed for a given height and diameter. This inefficiency is overcome by use of modern aerodynamic design principles and structural origami design methods. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel design for a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT), which would provide enhanced power output in addition to other advantages. The VAWT design includes a stage and a deflector. The stage includes two turbine sub-units, each with a rotor, and the rotor blades intermesh during rotation. The deflector diverts the incident wind away from the parasitic side of the blades which enhances wind loading leading to increased power output. Due to the vertical axis aspect and the simple nature of the design, this would be ideal for urban, suburban, and exurban areas where a lower spatial footprint is key. Additionally, transportation of this wind turbine would be easier since this would entail fewer moving parts (e.g. no gearbox).",

However, these conventional polymers used in slow-release fertilizer formulations are often not fully biodegradable. Companies are highly interested in replacing conventional polymers with a biodegradable alternative. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed an engineered bacteria to produce a biodegradable polymer coating for fertilizer pellets, allowing nitrogen to be released slowly over time. The polymer material is primarily made of gamma polyglutamate produced by Azotobacter vinelandii through a process that potentially can be scaled-up. Nitrogen is released to the soil from the fertilizer entrapped in the polymer-coated pellet and from the glutamate molecules that are the primary building block of the polymer coating. Thus, resulting in a completely biodegradable product. Lastly, this polymer is water soluble and negatively charged, which allows it to act as a flocculant agent in wastewater treatment.

Off-highway vehicles represent a major portion of US energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Electrifying or hybridizing these systems has the potential to yield substantial fuel savings through both efficiency improvements and energy recovery over the drive cycle. Legacy systems rely on hydraulic power transmission, which suffer from significant throttling and component losses. However, the extreme power density and transient requirements of these systems pose unique challenges to electrification that have so-far prevented broad commercial success. Moreover, extreme power requirements for these vehicles cannot be solved by using the electric drivetrain technology developed for passenger vehicles. To overcome these challenges, researchers have designed a new type of electric-hydraulic conversion machine which integrates the rotor of an electric machine with a hydraulic pump. Benefits of both the hydraulic domain (high power density) and electric domain (elimination of throttle losses, high component efficiency, controllability) are offered in this new machine. Three novel topologies are developed which combine the rotor of radial and axial flux machines with an eccentric ball piston hydraulic pump. This approach eliminates redundant bearings, seals, and points of energy conversion. Furthermore, the hydraulic fluid is utilized to cool the electric machine and associated drive electronics, allowing high electric loading.

Instead of using a conventional bidirectional shift register for the control of the power transistor array within the DLDO, the proposed NBTI-aware DLDO utilizes a novel unidirectional shift register for power transistor array control.

The economic costs of antibiotic resistance are enormous due to increased medical costs, long periods of hospitalization and increased mortality.

Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a family of antimicrobial peptides, based on the core peptide GL13, which exhibit several desirable characteristics for a novel antibiotic. These peptides directly attack the bacterial cell membrane making them less susceptible to bacterial resistance.

    "ip_description": "This technology proposes a novel area- and power-efficient approach for hardware implementation of sorting network circuits based on unary processing. Sorting is a common task in a wide range of applications from signal and image processing to switching systems. For applications that require high performance, sorting is often performed in hardware. Hardware cost and power consumption are the dominant concerns. The usual approach is to wire up a network of compare-and-swap units in a configuration called a Batcher (or Bitonic) network. In the proposed implementation, input data is encoded as unary serial bit-streams, with values represented by the fraction of 1\u2019s in a stream of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s. Synthesis results of complete sorting networks show up to 92% area and power saving compared to the conventional binary implementations, however, the latency increases. To mitigate the increased latency, this technology uses a novel time-encoding of data. The result is a low-cost, energy-efficient implementation with only a slight accuracy loss.",

However, the high temperature and harsh conditions inside an engine cylinder result in internal pressure sensors having a limited lifetime and the sensors add to the cost of the propulsion as well. Additionally, a fault diagnostic system that can monitor the functionality and health of the in-cylinder sensors would be valuable in planning and maintenance activities which would reduce cost. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a technology that makes use of a differential equation model specifically relating the combustion component of measured acceleration signal to the combustion component of in-cylinder pressure. It estimates the in-cylinder pressure and other combustion variables using a non-intrusive vibration/acoustic sensor located on the engine block. Estimation of the combustion variables would enable better closed-loop fuel injector control, leading to better fuel economy and reduced emissions. Additionally, fault diagnostics for simultaneous real-time health monitoring of fuel injectors, in-cylinder pressure sensors, and the non-intrusive vibration sensor could be another important application of this technology.

    "ip_description": "A method that enables the rapid recognition of wheat spikes and the fungus Fusarium Head Blight diseased areas in wheat. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a globally significant crop for human and animal consumption. In many regions of the world, wheat is vulnerable to severe yield and quality losses from the fungal disease of Fusarium head blight (FHB). The development of resistant cultivars is one means of reducing the devastating effects of this fungus, but the breeding process requires the evaluation of hundreds of lines each year for a reaction to the disease. These field evaluations are laborious, expensive, time-consuming, and prone to error. A method that can easily determine the level of FHB infection from images of wheat would greatly benefit the wheat breeding programs. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a high-throughput framework of deep-learning-based disease detection algorithms established to automatically assess wheat resistance to FHB under field conditions. This technique provides reliable identification of the symptom location and the disease severity of wheat spikes. It uses a mask region convolutional neural network (Mask-RCNN) model which was trained with annotated images with labeled diseased areas. The Mask-RCNN was used to predict diseased areas on each individual spike. This method enabled the rapid recognition of wheat spikes and diseased areas with detection rates of 77.76% and 98.81%, respectively with a prediction accuracy of 77.19%. This will contribute to the development of resistant wheat cultivars that will reduce the losses due to FHB, thereby contributing to global food security and sustainable agricultural development.",

A self-navigation strategy for improving the reconstruction of diffusion-weighted 3D multishot echo planar imaging (EPI). Self-navigation is a method for extracting the phase correction information from the acquisition itself, eliminating the need for a 2D navigator, and further accelerating the acquisition. Uses the data itself to ensure self-consistency between repeated acquisitions, such as those encountered in 3D dMRI, where subject physiological behavior such as respiration creates gross data in-consistencies for segmented (or averaged) acquisitions. Eliminates the need for additional or separate monitoring of physiologically induced variations. Works for weak signals, such as those from high diffusion weighting. Works with phase-encoding undersampling. Works with simultaneous multi-slab. Diffusion-weighted imaging is the most common MRI technique for determining the structural connectivity in the brain. For high-resolution imaging, multiple repetitions are a requirement, lengthening the total acquisition time. Physiological changes happen on a time scale shorter than the acquisition and introduces a change to the signal that when uncorrected, introduces artifacts in the images. The physiological changes, changes the phase of the MRI signal. The correlation with physiology can be tracked with additional external measurements or from additional measurements integrated with the acquisition \u2013 both of which have challenges. The self-navigation approach uses an uncorrupted part of the acquisition as a reference and corrects for the phase changes due to physiology before image reconstruction. The self-navigation enables correct image reconstruction, and the reduction of any additional navigators increases the scan efficiency and SNR and reduces acquisition time.",

    "ip_description": "A method of improving the energy efficiency of a hydraulic motor by rotating a valve cam for variable piston stroke. This technology may be applied to axial piston variable displacement pumps/motors in general if cam-based distributor valves are used instead of valve plates. In particular, the hydraulic motor in a line of inline hydromechanical transmissions (iHMT) - known as Hondamatic, is a viable application. The original Hondamatic was utilized in ATVs but similar designs are feasible in a wider range of applications, including on-road vehicles. The invention may also be applied to standalone variable-displacement hydraulic motors to improve power efficiency in any existing application. A typical axial-piston hydraulic motor with an adjustable swashplate and fixed valve timing cannot achieve ideal precompression and decompression across a range of operating conditions. This results in a loss in energy leading to a loss in efficiency for hydraulic motors used in All Terrain Vehicles and on-road vehicles. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a method of improving the motor's energy efficiency by rotating a valve cam for variable piston stroke. This allows, for each desired effective displacement of the hydraulic motor, a set of ideal valve timing to achieve perfect precompression and decompression so as to eliminate associated throttling losses. Efficiency improvements of as much as 10% can be achieved. The proposed method significantly improves the motor's efficiency in the iHMT. The design has been simulated, demonstrating efficiency improvements of up to 14.4% when applied to a motor in an inline hydromechanical transmission.",

Hydraulic cylinders are the most commonly used actuators for small, passive hydraulic systems such as passive human body controlled devices. One example is rehabilitation robots where the transmission extracts power from functioning muscle groups and delivers it to assist or guide stroke-affected muscle groups. In this system friction and leakage of the actuator are crucial, and typically rolling diaphragm cylinders perform best. However, rolling diaphragms currently available are limited to a stroke length being no greater than the bore of the cylinder. This restriction on the stroke length affects the work per cycle of the system and as a consequence decreases efficiency of the actuators. To address this issue researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a long-stroke rolling diaphragm (LSRD) cylinder that can be manufactured with any stroke length ( i.e, it is not limited to the standard the 1:1 stroke-to-bore ratio) while also displaying low friction and no leakage. Several tests have been conducted to evaluate the dynamic performance of this device including friction, stiffness, tracking impulse response, and step response. Results showed this new LSRD cylinder could operate at loads up to 700 kPa. In addition, a fatigue test of 1000 cycles showed a burst pressure of 350 psi could be reached.

It has been previously shown that XOR PUFs that compute XOR of standard linear PUFs can be easily attacked. In contrast, in the proposed PUF, the component PUFs are feed-forward and highly nonlinear.

    "ip_description": "A self-lubricated photopolymerization extrusion method for continuous production of profiled polymer parts, which can be deployed in self-growing robots capable of executing a range of tasks, including exploration, burrowing, and traversing tortuous paths.\n\nContinuous manufacturing of solid profiled polymer parts is challenging because common polymers have strong adhesion to various surfaces such as metal, glass, and other polymers. This leads to increased friction and eventually failure of the manufacturing process. Current available techniques to manufacture high-aspect profiled polymer parts are severely limited, and often require high melting temperatures, high-pressures, and complex machinery. Newly developed 3D printing techniques such stereolithography or vat photopolymerization can convert a liquid resin into solid parts via photopolymerization. However, they have limited applicability due to their finite build volumes and relatively low throughput. To address this limitation, Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a self-lubricated photopolymerization method that is able to continuously convert monomer fluid into a solid part. This novel method can be used to manufacture crosslinked polymer parts from various starting materials such as various meth(acrylate) monomers, but could also be readily extended to other photopolymerizable monomers. For instance, this novel photopolymerization technique can be used to produce growing robots with enhanced capabilities.\n\nGrowing robots are inspired by the biological tip growing process through which plant roots and vines are able to direct growth to reach new locations. As such, these robots interact with the environment by growing at their tip, instead of moving through surface contact like traditional robots. Unfortunately, current robots mostly grow using solid-state materials, which severely limits lengthening and their navigation capabilities. The novel self-lubricating photopolymerization technique addresses these problems by eliminating internal friction, which in turn allows for unrestricted growth of the robot's body through the environment. In addition, photopolymerization enables control over the material properties and growth patterns at the tip, which ultimately facilitates bending of its parts, navigation, and steering to avoid obstacles. Therefore, a growing robot utilizing the proposed method is capable of lengthening many times its original body length, burrowing in a simulated soil, passively avoiding obstacles, and traversing tortuous paths. A greater range of functionalities, including biodegradability, improved mechanical properties, and active steering, could be achieved by employing different chemistries and robot designs.",

This severely limits the food applications of pulse proteins, and as such protein beverages in the market are mostly formulated using whey protein. To address this problem, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a method to produce functional pulse proteins with increased thermal stability and solubility, while also meeting clean label requirements. This novel process first converts sugar inherently present in pulse protein starches into a mixture of mostly maltodextrin. This mixture is then combined with pulse protein isolates to produce partially glycated pulse proteins through an incomplete Maillard reaction. This novel process is scalable, does not compromise nutritional quality, and is especially suitable for acidic conditions, which is often the case for protein beverages.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "A new method of using hydrogen plasmas for rapid and carbon-free iron ore reduction using micron and submicron-sized iron ore particles. Iron ore reduction is essential for steel production, which accounts for about 8% of global CO2 emissions, due to the use of fossil fuels (such as coking coal) as reductants. The steel industry strives to reduce CO2 emissions from steel making by 50% by 2050. Currently, only ore with a large magnetite (Fe3O4) content is used, while hematite (Fe2O3) is discarded since there is a lack of technology to reduce it in an efficient way. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a rapid, carbon-free reduction method of iron ore in hydrogen plasmas. Different from a conventional reduction in blast furnaces, hydrogen plasma reduction is carbon-free when performed with renewable electricity, and when hydrogen is produced by electrolysis with renewable electricity. This work reports a reduction of small iron ore particles in hydrogen plasma in less than 0.1 seconds, which is about 100 times faster than other approaches to date. The plasma process charges particles negatively while in flight; the reactor walls are also negatively charged, hence, particles are repelled from the reactor walls and do not stick to the walls, which is a common problem in thermal approaches. This technology also yields a high percentage reduction of more than 90% at the same time being a carbon-free process. Additionally, this technology might have the potential to be agnostic to the type of the ore and be applicable for hematite reduction as well.",

The valves offer two order of magnitude reductions in power consumption, making them ideal for portable applications. They match the flow capacity of most miniature pneumatic valves. They offer highly linear control regardless of operating pressure. They are the fastest of any available pneumatic valves. Piezoelectric actuators require near-zero power to hold them at any static position. In contrast, conventional solenoid actuators constantly consume power to hold them at non-equilibrium positions. Piezoelectric pneumatic valves are superior for portable applications, as batteries can be downsized. However, to date, piezoelectric pneumatic valves have gained little commercial acceptance due to low flow capacity, low pressure capacity, or both. The revolutionary UMN valves achieve flow and pressure capacities comparable to common miniature pneumatic valves by combining unique seal or orifice plates with piezoelectric stack actuators. Their control characteristics are superior to solenoid valves, making them ideal for high precision applications such as mass flow controllers.",

    "ip_description": "A significant limitation in peptide drug design is the lack of methods that efficiently modify peptide backbones with functional groups that enhance the pharmacological properties of the peptides. Functional groups such as N-methylation are found in such as cyclosporin, where they confer useful biological traits, such as stability, membrane permeability, target selectivity, affinity, and oral bioavailability. However, it has been difficult to replicate N-methylation in synthetic peptides due to challenges in the synthesis process, high synthesis costs, and the inability to selectively methylate peptides. Novel solutions to these challenges would improve our ability to design new and effective peptide drugs.\n\nResearchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel technology that efficiently produces an alpha-N-methylated peptide at high yield. Briefly, this technology leverages the borosin natural product pathway that utilizes ribosomally encoded and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) pathways to incorporate \u03b1-N-methylations on peptides. This new process separates the N-methyltransferase from the borosin precursor allowing both to be expressed and purified separately. Subsequently, selective \u03b1-N-methylation is enzymatically introduced into a therapeutically relevant peptide. Unlike current systems this method installs the methylation after the peptide bond is formed allowing for the synthesis of a repertoire of peptides for downstream modification. The engineering and synthesizing of modified peptides using this method is simpler requiring fewer chemical steps, enzymes, and overall components. Additionally, the method also reduces off-target modifications. Together, this method provides a starting place for engineering efficient drug design.",

    "ip_description": "An analgesic combination of peripherally restricted opioids that eliminates the risk of respiratory depression, chemical addiction or abuse. The costly problem of pain is estimated that up to 100 million Americans live with moderate to severe pain as a result of disease or injuries. Opioid-based analgesics are the gold standard for pain treatment. However, the long-term use of these analgesics carries significant risk for lethal respiratory depression, tolerance, addiction and diversion. Approximately 25% of patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain misuse them at an estimated economic burden of $78.5 billion annually. There is a significant unmet need for pain management modalities without this social-economic burden. Opioid receptors reside in both the central and peripheral nervous system and risks associated with opioid analgesics are primarily due to actions within the central nervous system. There have been several strategies employed to avoid these risks, including: (1) slow-release opioid analgesics, (2) combining drugs that activate opioid receptors (agonists) with drugs that block opioid receptors (antagonists), (3) adding abuse-deterring compounds to the formulation, and (4) using opioid agonists that do not enter the brain. Unfortunately, these approaches have failed to provide effective pain management that truly eliminates the risk of addiction. University of Minnesota researchers Dr. George Wilcox and Dr. Carolyn Fairbanks have developed a novel method for treating pain by administering a peripherally restricted \u03bc-opioid analgesics in combination with a \u03b4-opioid receptor analgesic. Combining loperamide, a highly efficacious \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist that is excluded from the central nervous system, and oxymorphindole, a \u03b4-opioid receptor agonist that was shown to synergize with morphine spinally, elicits an analgesic effect in inflamed animals at doses as much as 150 times less than administration of either compound alone. Restriction of the \u03bc-opioid agonist to the peripheral nervous system eliminates the respiratory depression and abuse/addiction potential associated with opioid-based analgesics that gain access to the CNS. Furthermore, while the compounds behave synergistically in relation to their analgesic properties, their combination does not multiply observed side effects, which results in a therapeutic treatment window that is 5-50 times larger than either compound used alone. Taken together the loperamide-oxymorphindole combination is a promising pain intervention with a significantly diminished risk profile.",

    "ip_description": "The technology is a design of a medical device that can be placed in the ostium between the maxillary sinus and nasal passageway for treatment of chronic sinusitis. A medical device has been designed to relieve sinus congestion and pressure in chronic sinusitis patients. Sinusitis can be caused by infection, allergy symptoms, or autoimmune problems. In chronic cases lasting over 6-8 weeks, sinus surgery under general anesthesia is often required to relieve sinus congestion and inflammation of the nasal pathway. In healthy sinus activity, cilia in the ostium move mucus up a track into the nasal pathway where it can be drained. In cases of sinusitis this function is disabled, mucus builds up in the ostium, and the sinuses become infected. In order to correct chronic sinus infections, the ostium passageway must be opened and normal cilia function restored. The medical device is designed to treat chronic sinus infections with a minimally invasive approach, with less pain to the patient, decreased recovery time, as well as greatly shortening the duration of the procedure. The medical device is composed of a nasal implant and a catheter delivery system. The delivery system uses a catheter to gain access to the ostium through the nostril. With a retrograde delivery motion, the medical device is able to deliver the implant through a later portal on the catheter into the congested ostium from the posterior of the opening. The implant includes an open cross-section to open the passageway while exposing the cilia to promote normal function. The implant is intended to open and maintain patency of the sinus ostia, facilitating mucus drainage and nasal healing. The implant is made from a biodegradable material such that extraction of the implant will not be required. The implant may be coated with pharmaceutical agents including antibiotics, anti-histamines, anti-inflamatory and mucus thinning drugs to further aid in healing. The medical device or implant may also be impregnated with radio-opaque material to make them visible via x-ray to verify proper placement.",

    "ip_description": "HUH fusion tags are novel, robust endonucleases that allow proteins and DNA to be linked covalently in one simple step. Self-labeling enzymes such as the SNAP-tag, CLIP-tag, and HALO-tag are popular systems for specific protein-DNA bioconjugation. While these fusion tags are useful and efficient, they require the incorporation of expensive modified nucleotides bases and additional purification steps, which is costly and time-consuming. In addition, current protein tagging solutions use catalytic amino acids vulnerable to deactivation and are more likely to interfere with protein function due to the large size of the fusion enzymes used. Ultimately, current technologies offer a limited number of orthogonal or non-cross reactive self-labeling enzymes, which pose a bottleneck for development of multiplexed applications reliant on protein-DNA linkages, such as protein barcoding. To address this gap researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a suite of HUH enzymes (HUH-tags) for covalent linkage of proteins and nucleic acids. HUH are small proteins (~100 amino acids) found in viruses and mobile DNA elements which recognize and cleave single stranded DNA in a sequence-specific manner. These very small proteins can be engineered to bind many DNA sequences with minimal interference and utilize, more stable chemistry than pre-existing protein tags. Multiple HUH tags have been tested and work very robustly, and these tags can be used to fuse multiple types of proteins to nucleic acids (nuclear, cytoplasmic and cell-surface proteins). The chemistry works both in-vitro and in mammalian cells and multiple proteins can be labeled simultaneously in \u201cone pot\u201d reactions. The large number of available HUH enzymes expand the possibilities for orthogonal protein labeling and enable related applications in nucleic acid origami, molecular machine assembly, DNA-based drug delivery, and gene editing applications.",

A wide range of biochemical assays are available for measuring SARS-CoV-2 protease activity, but specific and sensitive cellular assays are less developed. There are currently no sensitive and specific live cell assays available for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibition, which hinders development of drugs to target this enzyme.

    "ip_description": "A novel data protection method that maintains the statistical accuracy of the data and also provides state-of-the-art data privacy. Datasets that consist of uniquely identifiable sensitive information need a high level of privacy protection. Differential privacy, which enables data sharing by adding randomness and describing the patterns of groups within the dataset while withholding information about individuals in the dataset, is the most rigorous form that is currently available. However, the mechanisms that provide differential privacy transform the dataset such that the statistical accuracy and usefulness of the dataset are lost, and requires bounded support of the data distribution to guard against extreme events. Profs. Xuan Bi and Xiaotong Shen at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel distribution-invariant privatization (DIP) mechanism to address the two aforementioned challenges for all types of univariate and multivariate data involving continuous, discrete, mixed, and categorical variables. Methodologically, DIP transforms each variable to a variable with bounded support, followed by perturbation to mask data, and a suitable mapping to the original scale. Since the data distribution is maintained, the downstream statistical accuracy is preserved. In real-world data analysis, with a given privacy budget, DIP improves existing benchmarks by 82% to 3170% in terms of accuracy across multiple datasets covering many mainstream statistical and machine-learning tasks. This method would be advantageous for companies across all industries that deal with uniquely identifiable or sensitive individual data. Organizations would no longer need to get a de-identification sign-off from the data owner and a time-consuming encryption process if this method is opted for. With this method, the transformed data can be shared easily since individual privacy is protected, yet the statistical properties of the data are maintained. This method would be beneficial to companies where data protection is needed, such as in the financial, medical, and smart-manufacturing industries. Additionally, companies that work with the following types of data will benefit from this method: Genomics, Health Care, Internet of Things (IoT), Geolocation based, US Census based, Social Media, Search Engine, Travel, Online Shopping, etc.",

However, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) and other high malignancy solid tumor types fail to respond to this approach. To address this issue, several researchers have proposed the use of T cell therapy using TCRs of high affinity against tumor antigens to overcome the solid tumor-induced immunosuppression. However, TCR modifications can lead to serious adverse responses in patients such as unwanted toxicity and rapidly induce T cell exhaustion, due to chronic TCR signaling resulting from high affinity TCRs. Seeking new therapeutic solutions researchers at the University of Minnesota have identified unique TCRs that are specific for an overexpressed tumor antigen Mesothelin. Mesothelin is overexpressed in most pancreatic and ovarian cancers, as well as many other cancers including subtypes of breast and lung cancer and AML. Here, T cells can be genetically modified to express a Mesothelin-specific TCR and transferred into patients with advanced disease for therapeutic benefit. In highly aggressive animal models of ovarian and pancreatic cancer, such an approach can lead to durable therapeutic responses for advanced intractable malignancies and is safe. This technology includes sequences of top candidate human mesothelin specific TCRs, which can lyse pancreatic and ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro. The proposed approach of using tumor-reactive TCRs in combination with novel strategies identified has a high potential to develop into effective durable cancer therapeutics since T cells which express tumor-reactive TCRs have repeatedly demonstrated the capability to eradicate large, bulky solid tumors in patients.",

    "ip_description": "An approach that enables data-driven methods to continuously learn and optimize resource allocation strategies in dynamic environments of wireless communications. Providing accurate predictions using data-driven models for wireless communication systems in a dynamic environment is extremely challenging. The key reasons behind the challenges are (a) the inability to learn from data across all times without over-writing information from earlier time-steps, and (b) additional memory requirement to incorporate information from earlier times. In existing systems, whenever the data distribution changes, the actual system performance significantly drops because the models are learned based on outdated information. Prof. Mingyi Hong at the University of Minnesota has developed a method that addresses the above challenges by using continuous learning and allocation of working memory for storing samples. To do this, dynamic temporal data is divided into episodes consisting of stationary data and retaining information from the most significant episodes. This makes the model predictions accurate since the model retains information from not only the most recent times (as in other models), but also from all previous significant times. Division of time into episodes of stationary data enables the model to incrementally learn from significant episodes without overwriting prior information. This is made possible by allocating working memory (based on available system memory size) for storing samples. The proposed method would be beneficial for all wireless communication systems, for tasks such as resource allocation, channel estimation, channel decoding, etc by improving the speed and accuracy of the model performance.",

    "ip_description": "Efficient hydraulic power-take-off circuit for wave-powered reverse osmosis desalination plants that independently controls the load on the wave energy converter and the pressure at the reverse osmosis membrane through a switching valve. Currently, 1% of the world\u2019s population consumes water from desalination, but the United Nations (UN) estimates that by 2025 this number will reach 14%. Desalination is mainly performed through reverse osmosis (RO) or distillation, which are both energy-intensive processes. Unfortunately, this high energy consumption makes desalination expensive and might result in high carbon emissions depending on the energy source. Wave-driven desalination plants, which use energy harvested from ocean waves to power RO systems, are a potential solution to this problem. However, significant design constraints and energy losses arising from coupling wave energy harvesting and RO processes need to be addressed, namely 1) that pressure pulsations generated by the wave energy harvesting process must not exceed levels appropriate for the RO system components and 2) that the operating pressure of the wave energy harvesting process is constrained to the limits of the RO process. To overcome these challenges researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a new fluid power circuit configuration that uses a hydraulic switch-mode power transformer (SMPT) with an electrical generator. In this new configuration, the SMPT uses the inertia of a hydraulic motor driven electric generator and switching of the hydraulic motor inlet between high and low-pressure sources to decrease the pressure at which power is transmitted to the RO process from the levels used in the wave energy harvesting process. This novel technology decouples the operating pressures of the wave energy harvesting and RO processes, allowing the wave energy harvesting process to operate at higher pressures, improving the power density and enabling a significant reduction in component sizes (e.g. a 77% reduction in displacement of the wave energy converter-driven pump). This technology can potentially lead to more sustainable and cost efficient desalination plants. This novel technology is particularly relevant for establishing desalination plants in vulnerable coastal communities, which have experienced persistent water shortages and have limited power supply. Besides wave-driven desalination plants this technology can be used to improve power density, decrease power consumption, and improve controllability of RO systems in water and wastewater treatment plants, and general fluid power circuit applications such as off highway equipment.",

These are either nucleic-acid, viral vector, inactivated virus, or protein based vaccines. However, each of these types has certain limitations. For example, nucleic acid based vaccines might not elicit sufficient immune responses because of inefficient DNA translation into proteins after injection. Viral vector vaccines have been associated with severe side effects and may be cleared by the host body quickly due to pre-immunity to the virus. Virus based vaccines have been associated with safety concerns, especially for immunocompromised people. Finally, protein-based vaccines might not be very efficacious because the human immune system has evolved to recognize virus particles as opposed to individual viral proteins. Thus, there is a need to develop robust and effective COVID-19 vaccines that can prevent infections without these drawbacks. Researchers at the University of Minnesota developed Nanominne-1, a series of novel vaccines that combine the advantages of both virus and protein based vaccines but without their associated drawbacks. Briefly, this novel vaccine contains 60 copies of SARS-CoV-2 antigens, which are displayed in an ordered array on a virus-like particle scaffold (nanoparticle). Antigens are displayed in high local density and repetitive patterns to induce a potent immune response. The proposed vaccine has shown strong neutralizing antibody responses in mice, and is expected to protect mice from future SARS-CoV-2 infections. The featured protein-scaffold has a high safety profile and is expected to be highly effective in activating an immune response in humans and preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

    "ip_description": "Engineered SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain expressed from stably transfected mammalian cell lines to be used as an effective diagnostic antigen against different SARS-CoV-2 variants. Currently, RBDs and the N proteins are the most commonly used antigens in COVID-19 diagnostic assays. However, the recent emergence of many SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised concerns over their ability to accurately predict COVID-19 infections. For instance, the N protein has relatively low specificity, and it cannot be used for people immunized by Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, once their produced immune response is based on spike mRNAs. On the other hand, RBDs are not strongly conserved across all virus mutants, and as a result, it might not be effective against new virus mutants. To address this problem, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed an engineered SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain with a D614G mutation, which can be used as an effective COVID-19 diagnostic antigen. This novel spike ectodomain is more evolutionarily stable and contains a higher number of epitopes than the traditionally used RBD antigens. Thus, this novel diagnostic antigen is more likely to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients infected with different virus mutations. This spike ectodomain is expressed from stably transfected mammalian cell lines and pursues enhanced resistance against denaturation or proteolytic degradation. The engineered recombinant spike ectodomain polypeptides can be quickly obtained with high yield and purity. Furthermore, scaled-up production for commercial uses can be readily achieved.",

Computer vision techniques and facial recognition algorithms are used to verify a patient's identify, proper placement of electrodes, continuous presence of the patient and their attention to provided tasks. Customizable treatment: specialized equipment and stimulation unit connects to a server, which delivers treatment with prescribed parameters such as frequency and length. Certification for prescribers and clinical staff: through online interactive training and testing of the platform, which leads to certification. Easy progress monitoring and evaluation of continuity of care: A summary of each treatment session is maintained on the server, where it can be shared with the prescriber/clinical staff as medical records via electronic transfer. Compulsive behavior disorders such as thoughts, urges, or behaviors that persist despite negatively affecting health, job, or relationships are considered complex brain disorders. Examples of such conditions include drug addiction, alcohol abuse and depression. Despite the prevalence of these psychiatric conditions in the modern world, current treatments mostly involve pharmaceutical interventions, which is not always beneficial to the patient. Recently, two new therapy treatments have received significant attention, electrical brain stimulation and cognitive treatments, which involve passing an electrical current over a user\u2019s head and requiring the person to repeatedly practice a cognitive training task such as a memory game, respectively. For enhanced results, these two approaches can be combined into one treatment, often defined as cognitive neuromodulation therapy. Unfortunately, the delivery of these two treatments combined is currently limited because patients are not able to administer these treatments unattended. To address this problem, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a system to deliver unattended cognitive neuromodulation therapy. This system includes basic equipment such as computer, camera, microphone, keyboard, and a screen as well as a customized neuromodulation stimulation unit and electrode cap. The appliances communicate wirelessly with the stimulation unit, controlling the timing and intensity of the stimulation delivered, synchronizing with the training tasks, and monitoring the current delivered. This novel system is connected to a server, which stores and delivers the prescribed treatment parameters such as frequency or length. A camera is used in conjunction with computer vision techniques and facial recognition algorithms to verify a patient\u2019s identity, ensure proper placement of the electrode cap, and assess patients presence and engagement throughout each treatment session.

This novel system also supports online training of healthcare professionals leading to a certification. All together, this novel system constitutes an effective, simple, user-friendly option to deliver at-home cognitive neuromodulation therapy treatments for patients suffering from compulsive psychiatric disorders.",

    "ip_description": "Iron nitride nanoparticles are post-processed by applying a wet ball milling method in conjunction with different surface-active media and centrifugation steps to obtain ultra-stable, monodispersed, uniformly sized, surface-functionalized, and sub-100-nm iron nitride nanoparticles suitable for biomedical applications. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are widely used in biomedical applications. However, there is an increased demand for magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with higher magnetic moments that can enable more sensitive magnetic diagnosis and lower dose treatments via magnetic bioassays, imaging, and therapies. To this regard, Iron nitride nanoparticles constitute a promising solution because their saturation magnetization is three times higher than that of IONPs, which corresponds to an estimated five to eight times higher sensitivity. However, the large and non-uniformly distributed sizes of \u03b3\u2032-Fe4N nanoparticles prevent them from being used in biomedical applications. Currently, there is no method capable of producing uniformly sized and surface functionalized \u03b3\u2032-Fe4N nanoparticles suitable for biomedical applications at scale. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a method that is capable of separating \u03b3\u2032-Fe4N nanoparticle agglomerates and functionalizing their surface with desired chemical groups, while also yielding ultra-stable, monodispersed, and uniformly sized nanoparticles. In this novel method, \u03b3\u2032-Fe4N dry nanoparticles produced by conventional manufacturing processes are separated and functionalized by applying a wet ball milling method along with different surface-active media. A follow-up centrifugation step is then used to effectively extract sub-100-nm and uniformly sized \u03b3\u2032- Fe4N nanoparticles from turbid suspensions. Thus, the proposed technology couples conventional NP manufacturing methods with post-processing steps to yield at-scale production of highly-stable, and uniform \u03b3\u2032-Fe4N nanoparticles suitable for biological and biomedical applications such as magnetic imaging, gene & drug delivery, magnetic hyperthermia therapy, magnetic separation, and magnetic biosensors.",

The resulting filter demonstrates improved capture efficiency and sensitivity toward separation of biological materials (cell, DNA, RNA, microorganisms, viruses) in water and other solvents. Additionally, this new filter reduces the number of steps needed, enables the capture of over 70% of the nucleic acid, exhibits higher loading capacity and capture efficiency, and enables separation and concentration of free nucleic acids in solution. This new process can be used to functionalize cellulose or nitrocellulose paper, glass fiber, or metal oxide filters with different pore sizes. Compared to existing commercial methods, the technology offers a low-cost, high-volume, and rapid method for separation and concentration of biological compounds. This is especially relevant toward nucleic acids due to limited capture efficiency demonstrated by existing systems. The chemistry can be applied toward a variety of filters and can be tuned to optimize pore size, affinity, and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, ultimately tuning the filter toward the target biomaterial and its environment.

Glassy thermosets, such as epoxy, are brittle and lack the mechanical toughness needed for many applications. Traditional toughening strategies for epoxy thermosets can be roughly classified into two categories: 1) modification with soft additives, including liquid rubbers and amphiphilic block copolymers; And 2) modification with rigid fillers, like silica particles, carbon nanotubes, clays, and graphenes. Both categories have their limitations. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel composite material with exceptional mechanical performance using graphene, block copolymer and epoxy. This material is prepared by combining a rigid platelet-shaped filler that is micron-scaled in the lateral dimension, and a soft filler that is nano-scaled to toughen a thermoset polymer matrix. Specifically, this material is made of (i) amphiphilic block copolymer with an epoxy miscible block and an epoxy immiscible block; (ii) resin material; and (iii) amine modified graphene oxide. Researchers have shown that the resultant hybrid composite exhibits a superior toughness that is higher than the combined toughening resulted from solitary modifiers. Furthermore, the elastic modulus of the hybrid composite is retained as that of the unmodified polymer matrix.

    "ip_description": "In the US over 5 million people suffer from cachexia, a serious condition of extreme weight loss and muscle wasting common in people with cancer, chronic heart failure, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease and other chronic diseases. In cancer patients, cachexia increases hospitalization costs, length of stay and mortality. While many biological pathways control appetite and weight, the final step is controlled by two brain receptors, melanocortin receptors 3 and 4 (MC3R and MC4R, respectively). Activation of MC4R results in decreased food intake while blocking MC4R results in increased food intake. Therefore, MC4R offers a druggable target in the pursuit of treatments for anorexia-cachexia syndrome. Researchers at the University of Minnesota leveraged the Agouti-related protein (AGRP), a potent orexigenic peptide that antagonizes MC3R and MC4R, to generate novel peptides that are highly potent and selective antagonists against MC4R. The AGRP-derived peptides were designed to mimic the active \u03b2-hairpin secondary structure that contains the hypothesized Arg-Phe-Phe pharmacophore. The most potent sca\ufb00old, c[Pro1-Arg2-Phe3-Phe4-Asn5-Ala6-Phe7-DPro8], comprised the hexa-peptide \u03b2-hairpin loop from AGRP cyclized through a DPro\u2212Pro motif. However, this scaffold is 16-fold less potent than AGRP at the mouse MC4R (mMC4R) thus necessitating modifications to facilitate studies in mouse models. A more potent mMC4R antagonist was generated containing a Phe7 to Nle7 substitution. This peptide was equipotent to the lead ligand 200-fold selective for the mMC4R over the mMC3R and caused a signi\ufb01cant increase in food intake when injected intrathecally into male mice (Fig 1). These compounds are a first step to developing MC4R antagonists for treating underweight conditions, including cachexia.",

However, compounds targeting MC4R are linked to severe side effects including hypertension and increased male erectile activity. Therefore, there is an unmet need for compounds that would address obesity without these off-target effects. Researchers at the University of Minnesota developed a non-selective macrocyclic melanocortin receptor ligand, MDE6-5-2c (cPro-His-Dphe-Arg-Trp-Dap-Ala-DPro) with nanomolar potency at the MC4R (Ericson, et al., 2017). MDE6-5-2c was administered in mice intrathecally or intracerebroventricularly and examined for its effect on food intake and energy homeostasis. Regardless of the route of administration, treatment with MDE6-5-2c resulted in decreased food consumption. However, differences were observed in food intake, respiratory exchange ratio and plasma biomarkers with IT having a slower onset but sustained effect while ICV had acute onset but shorter duration of action.

Testing for exposure and infection to coronavirus is important in addressing its spread and informs the ability of public health professionals in the deployment of containment measures including contact tracing and quarantining. Despite this importance, widespread testing remains a significant hurdle. Currently, COVID-19 testing requires labor-intensive RNA isolation, specialized instrumentation for real time RT-PCR, and results take 1 to 2 days to obtain. Thus, there is a critical need for a rapid, high throughput COVID-19 point-of-care test. In addition, there are two types of COVID, (Type I and Type II) and because of differences in translational efficiencies, Type II virus particles are believed to be more transmissible than Type I virus particles. Thus, there is a need for a simple test to identify and differentiate between the two types. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a sensitive assay for the detection of coronavirus and disambiguation between Type I and II viruses. Briefly researchers used commercially available reagents to develop a CRISPR/Cas9-based lateral flow assay (LFA) that can detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences with single base specificity. They also developed a rapid, multiplex fluorescence CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease cleavage assay capable of detecting and differentiating SARS CoV-2, influenza A and B, and respiratory syncytial virus in a single reaction.

    "ip_description": "An energy efficient modular convection-enhanced evaporation (CEE) system and control algorithm for brine management. Desalination systems provide alternative water sources, helping to address the global scarcity of freshwater. However, all desalination processes result in two fluid streams, the product stream and the byproduct stream known as the brine or concentrate. Heavily contaminated brines are also produced in several other industries, such as textile dyeing and electroplating. Brine management is subjected to strict environmental regulations that sometimes require zero liquid discharge. However, current brine disposal methods either pose significant risks to the environment (e.g. deep-well injection and land application) or involve high energy consumption and upfront costs, such as multi-effect distillation. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed both a modular convection-enhanced evaporation (CEE) system for brine management and a novel control algorithm/software that optimizes the operating settings of CEE in real-time to minimize energy consumption while maintaining a constant evaporation target. The software makes CEE a stand-alone unit (or group of units) able to operate in different weather conditions in an energy-efficient status. The software and the modular system provides a flexible design that can be easily manufactured and customized for different sized operations, and has lower thermal and electric consumption, footprint area, and total costs. The proposed CEE system is composed of a set of packed hydrophilic evaporation surfaces at uniform spacing. Liquid is released along each evaporation surface forming thin film, a fan attached to the CEE unit forces air flow over the films and the difference in vapor pressure between the air and liquid induces evaporation; a heating element is usually integrated in the system to preheat the fluid. The innovative design of the CEE device enables 5 times less energy consumption than traditional solutions, reducing the overall operating costs and carbon footprint. A case study (Alamogordo, NM) showed competitive costs of less than 1 USD per cubic meter of evaporated liquid. This new system has low maintenance costs, and it is particularly relevant for brine management for decentralized desalination plants and small industries.",

Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a bidirectional switching mechanism of a full MTJ stack and device that, unlike other technologies, relies only on the electrical field. This proposed technology performs bidirectional switching of the perpendicular magnetization via the electric-field manipulated exchange coupling of the synthetic antiferromagnetic free layer. This E-field driven magnetization switching of MTJ devices approach enables ultralow energy performance, ultrafast switching speed, low write error rate and read disturbances. This technology is compatible with currently used geometry and standard CMOS technologies, which facilitates easy integration with conventional devices in the market. This invention can also be used as a novel design for spin based memory and logic devices. The proposed device has high stability, scalability, and can easily be fabricated in wafer scale.",

    "ip_description": "Spintronics-based memory array system that performs true in-memory computational operations. The novel spin Hall effect (SHE) technology is used to implement a new CRAM computer architecture (SHE-CRAM) that is capable of inter-raw communication. In traditional computing systems, a central processing unit retrieves data from a memory, performs an instruction on the data to produce a result and returns the result to memory for storage. Thus, data must be transferred along a bus each time an instruction is executed. The process of physically moving data from memory to the processor introduces significant power consumption and delays, especially for large-scale data analytics applications. Currently this issue is addressed by using near-memory processing (NMP), where the computational unit is put at the periphery of memory. NPM provides fast access to data but still implies high energy consumption and delays. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a true in-memory computational platform called SHE-CRAM that effectively addresses the communication bottlenecks of current hardware paradigms. The Computational Random Access Memory (CRAM) utilizes spintronics-based memory array to organically enable logic operations within the array. In this invention, a novel spintronics technology, spin Hall effect (SHE) based memory array, is applied to obtain a new CRAM structure. The proposed SHE-CRAM platform is fast, reliable, features a large noise margin and allows inter-raw communication. As a result, this novel computational platform can perform more universal logic operations. The SHE-based CRAM uses materials with ultra high spin Hall efficiency such as BiSe and other topological insulators, which allows low writing voltage and small energy dissipation during computing operations. The SHE-memory cell features a three-terminal scheme, which enables gating control and in turn provides another degree of freedom for computational operations. Thus, the SHE-CRAM platform can significantly improve CPU-centric computing. Potential applications include big-data analytics, deep neural-network such as pattern recognition, mobile devices, and IoT devices particularly for artificial intelligence (AI).",

People with cognitive challenges and their care partners (caregivers) are often overwhelmed when they receive complex instructions or overly general guidelines after clinical appointments.

However, these resources only provide general advice and are often left unused or discarded. While structured training programs offer better training, they require long time commitments (several weeks to months outside of clinical visits), and are not customized to specific needs of the patients. Researchers and clinicians at the University of Minnesota and Minneapolis VA Health Care System have created an easy-to-understand, actionable, and customizable care program for persons with cognitive challenges and their partners. Clinicians can use this program during clinical sessions to collaboratively develop a \"Just One Thing\" care plan, which would provide clients a strategy to focus on until the next visit. This plan also enables an easy method to track progress. Having an adaptable planning worksheet gives caregivers a simple and clear plan that is specific to the patient they are caring for.

    "ip_description": "A microalgae strain that secretes simple sugars in conditions favorable for co-culture schemes and fermentation processes. Biomass fermentation processes represent an alternative avenue to produce fuels and commodity chemicals with reduced environmental impacts. Currently, land crops (corn, sugarcane, and sugar beets) are the main source of sugar-rich biomass for fermentations, but they require considerable cultivation time and post-harvest processing to extract and yield the monomeric sugars needed for downstream applications. Thus, feedstock costs represent a large portion of the total process costs, imposing minimum molar yields for commercial viability. The use of lignocellulosic biomass, electro-biotechnology approaches, and C1 feedstocks (CO, CO2 and CH4) have been proposed as potential solutions. Microalgae stand out for their ability to use C1 feedstocks, having a faster growth rate than land plants, and the availability of existing infrastructure for a variety of industrial applications. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed methods of producing simple sugars using a microalgae strain, and a method of co-culture of the microalgae strain with other microbes to biosynthesize a product of interest using the sugars secreted by the microalgae strain. The recently isolated microalgae strain is found to secrete simple sugars into its extracellular environment under a broader range of pH than previously reported strains. Its high flexibility in pH, and ease of culture, enables co-culturing of a variety of microbes that can convert secreted simple sugars into other products such as ethanol. This method is also of interest for carbon sequestration by converting carbon dioxide to glucose. This alga has the potential to decrease our reliance on conventional crops as a source of simple sugars. The ability to co-culture with other microbes opens new opportunities for reducing energy consumption, time, and wastage in biomanufacturing processes. This strain is more suitable for industrial applications, as many biosynthetic strategies are developed around a sugar feedstock; and, unlike this strain, most algae produce internal polysaccharides (starch) or complex carbohydrates in the extracellular space, which are not suitable for co-culturing systems.",

    "ip_description": "A series of methods and designs to quickly and accurately fabricate partial dentures from intraoral scanning without stone or printed models. The methods include harnessing the abilities of 3d printing, milling, and scanning technology to allow for the most efficient clinical and laboratory outcomes. The removable partial denture is a removable dental prosthesis that replaces some, but not all the teeth in the dental arch. Currently, the fabrication of removable partial dentures often involves a complicated workflow that creates unintended issues. As such, patients may require multiple visits to adjust and correct errors in the partial denture due to outdated fabrication procedures (detrimental effects of duplicating stone models, acrylic shrinkage, etc). John Madden CDT., with guidance from Prof. Olin at the University of Minnesota has developed a method that expedites the clinical and eliminates laboratory steps of the manufacturing process of the conventional removable partial denture. Using this method, precisely designed dental prosthetics can be produced directly from intraoral scans and 3D printing. This method eliminates the need for labor-intensive fabrication methods that use stone and heat cured acrylic. Additionally, the number of return patient visits can be significantly reduced while also improving patient outcomes. The technology includes three major components that can be applied to different types of commonly used partial dentures. First, the \u201ctooth-horn\u201d is a replacement for the all-acrylic or flexible partial denture. Second, the framework application which allows for \u201cslideability\u201d of the framework and the denture base to be assembled and adhered without a stone model.

    "ip_description": "A disruptive machine learning architecture invented for privacy-sensitive entities to collaborate with each other without sacrificing the quality of gained intelligence. Concerns of data security and privacy have led to more stringent regulations on the use of data in machine learning. Successful conventional machine learning architectures provide intelligence from user data sets but often require disclosure of that data. Collaborating with privacy is one of the most significant challenges in contemporary machine learning. There, designing machine learning architectures that facilitate not only accuracy, but also privacy and data security is of high interest. In addition, there is also a growing demand for protecting the learner units that manage data. To address these issues, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed Assisted Machine Learning Architecture, a disruptive technology invented for privacy-sensitive entities to collaborate without sacrificing the quality of gained intelligence. In Assisted Machine Learning Architecture, an entity/learner assists another entity's machine learning by iteratively exchanging non-private statistics such as confidence scores. This newly developed methodology can be applied to a broad range of machine learning types such as regression and classification, and can allow assistance among numerous entities in a computationally efficient manner. This invention simultaneously addresses two challenges in the current machine learning ecosystem. 1) Privacy: the state-of-the-art privacy focuses only on data. This technology offers several methods and software architecture that focus on the protection of each learner unit, models as well as data. 2) Design of decentralized machine learning architecture: Each learner has the flexibility of assisting or being assisted by others, which simultaneously facilitates flexibility, fairness, privacy, and personalization, a design drastically different from previous state-of-the-art architectures (such as the current popular Federated learning, a centralized learning architecture, advocated by multiple influential technology companies). Assisted Machine Learning Architecture is applicable in privacy-aware, transmission-economical, and decentralized learning scenarios such as collaborations between clinics or hospitals, services among financial institutions, distributed learning among smart devices/mobile apps, and between IT companies. Additional applications include machine assisted learning among cameras that observe the same objects, among clinical divisions that record the same patients, etc. Key Benefits & Differentiators: **Data:** Data are not exchanged or released, Model architectures and parameters are not exchanged, Only task-relevant statistics are exchanged. **Models:** Autonomously-chosen models without a global model, Personalized learning goals. **Architecture:** Any individual module can be either service provider or user, Adversarial modules allowed. **From the user's perspective:** Module-level privacy, Private model & task objective, as well as private data, Active querying of useful information to assist personalized learning. **From the service provider's perspective:** Module-level privacy, Private model as well as private data, Active responding to benign queries to assist each user's personalized learning in a black-box manner.",

Non-pneumatic tires, tires that are not supported by gas pressure, offer several advantages over conventional pneumatic (air-filled) tires. Though potentially viable, existing non-pneumatic tire constructions and designs are less than optimal. For example, non-pneumatic tires are often significantly stiffer than their pneumatic counterparts, which results in substantially less-cushioned ride and therefore contributes to slower adoption in the automotive industry. Additionally, non-pneumatic tires are typically heavier than pneumatic tires. Non-pneumatic tires have an equivalent and sometimes shorter lifespan than pneumatic tires because of reliance on buckling of the spokes to bear loads. To address these issues, researchers at the University of Minnesota have designed and developed a non-pneumatic tire that offers extreme asperity accommodation (i.e. high cushion) and better durability compared to existing options. This technology uses topological polarization principles in rolling devices for enhanced local absorption of terrain asperities. Increased localized softness along the outer radius prevents transferring of significant forces to the axle, thereby increasing cushion. This technology also utilizes topological protection principles to increase resistance to performance deterioration from the erosion of material caused by wear in rolling devices, thereby increasing its durability and duration of usability.",

Incorporation of degradable polymers in general plastic applications includes food packaging, utensils, films, and biomedical devices. Key Benefits & Differentiators include: Non-toxic and renewable starting materials; Enhanced hydrolytic degradability with potential to be biodegradable; Simple, cost-efficient, and industrially relevant method; Sustainable; Incorporation of salicylic acid units does not negatively impact other material properties. Most commodity plastics are derived from fossil fuels, are not readily degradable, and are largely found as single-use packaging, leading to significant environmental concerns and driving interest in new sustainable and degradable polymers. While the global degradable polymer market is rapidly growing, some of these polymers are still difficult to degrade, requiring high temperature, humidity, and microorganism concentration in industrial facilities. Polylactide (PLA) is industrially produced in large scale and is part of a larger class of polyesters based on renewable monomers. Incorporating salicylic acid into these polyesters enhances degradability in soil and water (including sea water). Additionally, alternative methods to make more competitive degradable polymers typically involve products derived from fossil fuels and complicated synthesis processes, ultimately limiting their sustainability and utility. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a new strategy to incorporate salicylic acid moieties into commercial polymers, including PLA, polycaprolactone (PCL) and a derivative of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PETg), through a straightforward transesterification approach. Incorporation of salicylic acid moieties has been shown to greatly enhance the hydrolytic degradability of polymers without sacrificing other material properties. Additionally, transesterification has been broadly used in polymer chemistry and can be readily incorporated into industrial processes. This new approach enables development of sustainable and degradable polymers in a simple, scalable, and cost-efficient method.",

    "ip_description": "A multi-functional photopolymerizable glue that enhances the physical and biological adhesion between soft skin and a metal prosthetic device. Osseointegrated (OI) prosthetic devices were designed to overcome the limitations of press-fit socket devices and to improve life quality of limb amputees. Despite substantial progress made in optimizing implant design, surgical techniques and post-surgery rehabilitation, limitations such as implant associated infection and poor sealing at the skin interface have prevented widespread use of OI prosthetic devices. A recent meta analysis found that deep infections resulting in implant loosening occurred in up to 29% of patients. These infections can thereby affect implant longevity, residual limb health and function, and in particular, widespread usage of the OI implants. Current approaches to address these issues involve altering the surface topography of the metal implant or biomimetic coatings but with limited success. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a multi-functional photopolymerizable glue that enhances the physical and biological adhesion between soft skin and an Osseointegrated metal prosthetic device while reducing infection rate. When applied between the material of the prosthetic device and skin, this visible light polymerizable glue strengthens the skin-implant interface. Enhanced interface adhesion, in turn, improves the wound healing process and leaves the site of surgery less vulnerable to infection. One of the active materials used in this glue supports the release of cytokines from keratinocytes, which are key for supporting wound healing without the need of additional growth factors. Furthermore, antimicrobial peptides incorporated into the glue through silicate nanostructures provides an additional, prolonged line of defense against infection until a stable seal can be achieved. This technology offers an opportunity to use a biocompatible bioactive adhesive that can provide a porous mechanical buffering scaffold which will thereby support skin tissue attachment to the metal surface. Additionally, the application of this glue does not require any alteration to existing materials but only an additional step of applying the glue during the surgical procedure. This technology can be easily used for prevention of failure by infection of other transmucosal implants and devices, such as dental implants.",

Using the SCR system, unburned ammonia and nitrogen oxides (NOX) in the engine exhaust is catalytically reduced, thereby reducing poisonous gas emission while generating heat and hydrogen that can be recycled to improve combustion. This design can be installed in the exhaust stream of combustion-based power systems, enabling retrofitting onto existing power plants and engines, as well as incorporation as original equipment.

    "ip_description": "Characterizing analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is a challenging task because the performance of an ADC is sensitive to the noise in the measurement setup. Among these metrics, differential non-linearity (DNL) and integral non-linearity (INL) are the standard linearity parameters which are obtained from a histogram of the ADC codes for a slow triangular input voltage signal. The frequency of the triangular signal during a non-linearity test should be low enough to avoid any settling time issues. In the ideal case, all ADC codes appear the same number of times during a non-linearity test. In reality, however, some codes may have a higher or lower count than the ideal count due to non-linearity in the circuit and/or due to noise effects. This is because the input-output (IO) signals are switching at a high frequency while the ADC is performing the sensitive analog to digital conversion. Consequently, this setup is not suitable for characterizing high resolution ADCs or studying subtle shifts in ADC performance. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel light-weight measurement circuit employing a bank of counters for precise differential non-linearity (DNL) and integral non-linearity (INL) characterization. This technology is immune to measurement noise as the ADC operation and data transfer operation are separated in time.

The ability to validate sterilization procedures in situ and in a risk-free manner is attractive to a very large market. As the characteristics, quantity, placement of the surrogate virus can be controlled, this method can be used to fine tune or develop new feed treatment processes that are more effective.

Fluid bags used for intravenous (IV) infusion are prepared with some air in the bag. When priming IV tubing for infusion with a rapid infuser device, the air in the fluid bag needs to be removed first. The current method to remove air involves spiking the fluid bag (at the outlet valve) with the IV tubing spike provided. The user then disconnects the spike from the bag, turns the bag over so that the air is near the bag valve, burp the bag until all the air has been extracted, and then re-spike the bag with the IV tubing. This method involves multiple spikes of the fluid bag with the same device, which increases the risk of contamination of the spike tip, decreases the tightness of the connection, and adds time. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel one-way purge valve that allows for quick removal of air from IV fluid bags with a single spike. This medical device accessory is designed to purge air from the bag prior to the start of infusion. A healthcare professional will first spike the fluid bag with this purge valve. The one-way valve used in this purge valve device facilitates removal of air from the bag while still attached. Once the air is purged, the conventional IV tubing spike is inserted into the purge valve to begin infusion.

Current neuromodulation therapeutic devices are designed to stimulate a single brain target, largely in an open-loop fashion. They cannot produce targeted change in specific sub-circuits/networks.

Specifically, current devices cannot address mood, anxiety, or cognitive disorders, and have failed RCTs in those spaces. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel closed-loop and deep brain stimulation system that can directly read out and alter the connectivity of specified brain networks. The key has been the development of novel approaches to lock stimulation pulses to ongoing brain activity, especially to the phase (rise and fall) of ongoing electrical brain rhythms. When this precisely time-locked stimulation is given, network communication changes. Those changes can last for hours after the stimulation stops. Communication between individual brain areas can be increased or decreased, and specific electrical frequencies (communication channels) can be targeted. In between stimulation pulses, the system contains specialized signal processing circuitry to measure brain network connectivity in real time, and to predict a patient\u2019s behavioral state based on that network activity.

A Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a battery-operated mechanical pump that helps the left ventricle pump blood to the rest of the body. During implantation surgery, the graft that carries the blood from the LVAD pump to the aorta needs to be placed and sized appropriately. Typically, a surgeon determines the placement of the LVAD during surgery, cutting the graft as necessary to install the device. As every patient is different, a surgeon essentially \u201ceyeballs\u201d where to place the device during an operation and trims the graft while taking very few measurements. If the graft length is too long, the graft may kink, causing turbulent blood flow that damages blood cells. If too short, the graft may press on the right ventricle, compressing the right coronary artery and interfering with the expansion and contraction of the right ventricle. Importantly, any imprecise location of and/or mal adjusted angle of graft attachment, and positioning of pump, may result in adverse events. To address these issues, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed an image processing algorithm that can assist surgeons in determining where and how the device should be surgically implanted. This algorithm processes routine pre-procedural CT scans to identify specific regions (such as mitral valve, apical dimple, etc.) of the patient\u2019s heart. Using this information, the algorithm determines the most ideal implant placement parameters in terms of distance and direction from the apical dimple, and the optimal length of the graft.

Previous work has shown that, by breaking a 2D RF pulse into multiple undersampled k-space segments, the excitation bandwidth can be increased. However, this requires fully sampled acquisition k-space, which in turn leads to increased imaging time. To address this issue, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a new method for accelerating image acquisition using segmented 2D RF pulses as virtual receivers. Data acquisition is accelerated using segmented RF pulses for excitation and refocusing, and undersampling k-space in a phase-encoded dimension that is in the direction of excitation segments. By finding the redundancy found between the data from different segments, acquired undersampled data can be used to synthesize unsampled data. Image reconstruction can be performed by applying Generalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisition (GRAPPA) or other commonly parallel imaging techniques. This is made possible by treating the signals from each pulse segment as if they were received by a virtual coil with a spatially dependent sensitivity map. Whereas conventional techniques such as GRAPPA rely on simultaneous imaging with more than one receive coil, the virtual receive coil concept used in this method makes it suitable for scanners with single receive coils.",

    "ip_description": "A non\u2010Cartesian k\u2010space reconstruction method using self-calibrated, region\u2010specific interpolation kernels for highly accelerated acquisitions in MRI. In MRI scanning, parallel imaging techniques such as GRAPPA use properties of multicoil receiver arrays to recover missing k\u2010space data points using nearby acquired k\u2010space samples. In conventional non\u2010Cartesian GRAPPA with through\u2010time GRAPPA (TT\u2010GRAPPA), the use of region\u2010specific interpolation kernels has demonstrated improved reconstruction quality in dynamic imaging for highly accelerated acquisitions. However, TT\u2010GRAPPA requires the acquisition of a large number of separate calibration scans, which lengthens overall scan duration; for every ~20 s data acquired, there is a ~3 min calibration data acquisition step. To eliminate calibration steps and reduce overall scan time, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a new reconstruction method named Self\u2010calibrated Interpolation of Non\u2010Cartesian data with GRAPPA (SING) to self\u2010calibrate region-specific interpolation kernels from dynamic undersampled measurements. The SING method synthesizes calibration data to adapt to the distinct shape of each region-specific interpolation kernel geometry, and uses a novel local k\u2010space regularization through an extension of TT\u2010GRAPPA. This calibration approach is used to reconstruct non\u2010Cartesian images at high acceleration rates while mitigating noise amplification. Researchers have shown that SING offers visually and quantitatively similar reconstruction quality to TT\u2010GRAPPA, and provides improved reconstruction quality over conjugate\u2010gradient SENSE in both numerical phantom and in vivo cine data sets. In the SING method, the computational burden is spent up-front and is low for subsequent data; and can be highly parallelized for rapid application such as for free-breathing scans.",

In MRI systems, placement of high dielectric constant (HDC) pads between the subject and dipole antennas of radio frequency (RF) coils has been shown to significantly improve the image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and B1 field uniformity, while reducing the overall required input RF power. In addition, HDC pads improve transmission efficiency without requiring changes to the software or hardware alterations in standard clinical MRI systems. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have designed a novel RF coil apparatus with antenna-HDC material that is shown to substantially improve B1+ efficiency compared to currently available designs with HDC material or with inductively shortened dipole materials. This improvement is achieved by a simple counterintuitive modification in the antenna-HDC material setup, and does not require any additional hardware or software modifications. Using an 8 channel array at 10.5T, researchers have demonstrated that this new design improves the B1+ efficiency by 2-fold and SAR (specific absorption rate) efficiency comparable to a typical RF coil setup with HDC pads. Furthermore, computer simulation and experimental evidence shows that the radiated field to the RF shields is also reduced using this new design.",

GRAPPA, one of the most clinically-used linear reconstruction methods for parallel imaging, suffers from noise amplification. As an alternate, a nonlinear method that utilizes subject-specific convolutional neural networks for k-space reconstruction, Robust Artificial-neural-networks for k-space Interpolation (RAKI) was proposed and shown to improve noise resilience over linear methods. Advancing this RAKI method, researchers at the University of Minnesota have now developed a method to reconstruct images from undersampled k-space data using a residual machine learning algorithm that combines the benefits of both linear GRAPPA and nonlinear RAKI reconstructions. This hybrid method, called residual RAKI (rRAKI), offers significant improvement in image quality compared to linear method, and improves upon RAKI in highly accelerated simultaneous multi-slice imaging. Specifically, the convolutional neural network in the residual network removes the noise amplification arising from coil geometry in the linear part. Experiments in brain imaging show that rRAKI has noticeable advantages over linear methods in terms of noise resilience, produces sharper images and generates fewer blurring artifacts compared to RAKI. Furthermore, rRAKI maintains the scan-specific reconstruction offered by the RAKI method. Lastly, implementation of rRAKI does not require changes to hardware or data acquisition methods, and can have significant image quality improvements especially in lower strength MRI systems.",

    "ip_description": "A design and method to fabricate high-gyrotropic optical isolators directly on Si and other common substrates, without using seed layers. This foundry-friendly technology enables creation of smaller, high performance components. Optical isolators are unidirectional passive devices used in photonic integrated circuits to protect the laser from destabilizing back reflection of light. The unidirectional nature of an isolator is realized by using the magneto-optical property of rare earth iron garnets. The effectiveness of an isolator largely depends on the Faraday rotation (magnetic gyrotropy), the extent to which the material can rotate (or phase delay) light. Today, thin layers of magneto-optic materials are grown epitaxially on garnet substrates, using molten saturated baths of lead oxide (a process called liquid phase epitaxy). These are currently used in free space and fiber-coupled isolators (light goes through the thickness of the garnet) For waveguide isolators, academic researchers have found ways to grow magneto-optic materials on semiconductors, but a seed-layer is needed to crystallize the garnet phase. While seed layer-based methods have been shown to produce high quality isolators with high Faraday rotations, the processes involved are not reliable, require several additional steps, and are prone to defects. Additionally, non-reciprocal phase shift (NRPS) based designs are used to obtain large isolation ratios, but this design is so far only practical in TM-mode operation and they are two-dimensional structures. Our waveguide isolator designs are 1-D (higher densities of devices are possible), magnet-free (important to reduce device cross talk and also for applications such as quantum clocks), and work for TE- and TM-modes. Importantly, most integrated lasers are TE-mode. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a new design and process optimization method to fabricate high performance optical isolators with high gyrotropy. This technology uses a foundry-friendly, seed layer-free, RF reactive co-sputtering process to fabricate an optical isolator directly on Si and other common substrates (like silica). By taking advantage of a temporally-varying characteristic trend(s) arising during the sputtering process, the researchers have manufactured magneto-optical isolators with repeatable Faraday rotation values >-3,200 deg/cm, and optical isolation >30 dB, for 1550 nm infrared light. Moreover, the design and placement of the one-dimensional isolator presented here offers high optical isolation from tapers or device interfaces.",

Thin-film deposition is a fundamental step in the fabrication of components for optics, electronics, packaging, and other applications, and is expected to reach a market size of $22 billion by 2022. Currently, the method of choice to evaporate refractory and noble metals is electron-beam physical vapor deposition (EBPVD). EBPVD involves bombardment of a target with an accelerated electron beam in high vacuum to evaporate or sublime the elemental metal of interest, which is then deposited onto a surface. Despite its ability to vaporize metals that require >2000\u00b0C, EBPVD technique is expensive. Furthermore, to obtain metal-oxide depositions, oxygen must be introduced into the chamber, which can compromise the equipment and materials and therefore the quality of deposition. Prof. Bharat Jalan\u2019s research group at the University of Minnesota have developed a method that allows thin-film deposition of refractory or noble metals or their metal-oxides at much lower temperatures than current methods such as EBPVD. Additionally, a method for the production of thin-films of predetermined oxidized refractory metals similar to metal-organic chemical vapor deposition has been developed. The device includes a vacuum chamber containing an evaporation source (such as an effusion cell) enabling refractory metal thin-film deposition at low temperature using solid metal-organic substances. The potential application is the use of this system to deposit thin films of refractory metals such as platinum, iridium and ruthenium, as well as metal-oxides at the desired oxidation states in a controlled manner. The advantages of the technology are the reduced cost and the low temperature operation for thin film production compared to the current methods.",

Traditional methods of detection require the growth of microorganisms in media and detection is only possible when growth reaches a high number of colony-forming units, which can take several days. On the other hand, biomarker-based detection methods are fast but lack specificity and have poor sensitivity. These techniques still require 12-48 hours of enrichment before detection.\n\nProf. Abdennour Abbas at the University of Minnesota has developed a high-sensitive microbial screening and identification assay that can be completed in 1 hour. Rapid screening of samples is enabled by a chemiluminescence signal that is altered by the presence of microorganisms. The method of action is as follows: the oxidation of gold nanoplates (or nanotriangles, AuNT) particles by tris(2-carboxyehtyl)phosphine (TCEP) generates a long term, stable chemiluminescence signal in the presence of luminol chemical. As a reducing agent, TCEP also targets disulfide bridge (DSB)-containing proteins on the surface of microorganisms. The competitive reaction of TCEP-gold nanoplates and luminol in conjunction with the TCEP reaction with the DSB proteins of microorganisms allowed the researchers to develop methods for screening the presence of microorganisms. Additionally, specific pathogens can be shielded from the chemiluminescence signal by antibodies which allows for identification of target microorganisms. Use of this technology will not only aid in the treatment and prevention of microbial diseases but also reduce costs in the medical and food industry due to increased automation and faster processing times.",

BPTF is implicated in various types of cancer, such as breast cancer, melanoma, lung, bladder, and etc. Therefore, inhibitors targeting this protein could potentially be effective against multiple cancers. BPTF has also been shown to play an immunomodulatory role supporting an additional mechanism for anticancer therapy. The inhibitors developed here are highly water soluble, low molecular weight and potent, resembling good drug-like physicochemical properties. Genome instability and mutations is one hallmark of cancer. Epigenetic alterations concern heritable yet reversible changes in histone or DNA modifications that regulate gene activity beyond the underlying sequence. The emerging epigenetic therapy for cancers seek to normalize DNA methylation patterns and post-translational modifications on histones that promote or maintain a malignant phenotype. The Nucleosome Remodeling Factor interacts with chromatin through its largest subunit, the bromodomain and PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF), resulting in changes to chromatin accessibility and gene expression. BPTF is overexpressed in several cancers and has been shown to promote resistance to several chemotherapeutics. Targeting BPTF using small-molecule inhibitors presents a potential strategy for anti-cancer therapies. While numerous chemical probes have been developed for other bromodomain proteins, inhibitor development for BPTF has lagged behind.

This material is ideal for developing magnetic memory devices such as magnetic domain wall-based devices, where spin-transfer torque and spin-orbit torque combine to efficiently operate the device. This new spin Hall material and device has several advantages: It produces large spin-orbit torque that can efficiently switch in and out of plane magnetization. In a device with a ferromagnetic insulator as the magnetic layer, it can produce large spin-orbit torque with a very small current. In a device such as magnetic domain wall, spin-transfer torque and spin orbit torque work together to produce large domain wall velocity. The researchers have discovered SOT from magnetron-sputtered BixSe(1-x) thin film in a BixSe(1-x) /CoFeB heterostructure by using a novel DC planar Hall method. The spin Hall angle from the BixSe(1-x) thin film was found to be as large as 22.41, which is the largest ever reported at room temperature. Moreover, the researchers have demonstrated switching of perpendicular magnetization using SOT from the BixSe(1-x) with the lowest-ever switching current density reported in a bilayer system, 2.7\u00d7105 A/cm2, at room temperature. Furthermore, the smooth surface of the BixSe(1-x) film yields better device performance, and growth of the film on a silicon substrate enables easier integration into existing CMOS devices. The giant spin Hall angle, large spin Hall conductivity, low switching current density at room temperature, smooth surface, and growth of the films on silicon substrate make the magnetron-sputtered BixSe(1-x) thin film a very strong candidate as an SOT generator in SOT-based memory and logic devices.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "A low-cost system for computing stochastically using periodic analog signals. In stochastic computing, circuits operate on randomized bit streams. Currently, physical random sources or pseudo-random constructs such as linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) are used to generate random bit streams. However, these stochastic number generators can account for as much as 80% of the total stochastic circuit cost. Additionally, long run-time of stochastic circuits, together with the high power consumption of the existing stochastic number generators, could lead to significantly higher energy use than their conventional binary counterparts. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel system for generating stochastic bit streams using analog periodic pulse signals. Exploiting pulse width modulation (PWM), signals corresponding to specific values are generated by adjusting the frequency and duty cycles of PWM signals. With this approach, the latency, area and energy consumption are all greatly reduced. Experimental results show up to 99% performance speedup, 98% saving in energy consumption, and 40% area reduction compared to existing methods. In this technology, instead of communicating data to and from the stochastic computation components in the form of random or pseudo-random digital stochastic bit streams, the bit streams are communicated as pulse-width modulated signals. Signal generators can be configured to generate and output the signals, for example, by adjusting the frequency (periods) and duty cycles so as to encode values in a manner that allows the encoded analog signals to be utilized with conventional stochastic digital logic components. The approach is motivated by the observation that, as technology has scaled and device sizes have gotten smaller, the supply voltages have dropped while the device speeds have improved. Control of the dynamic range in the voltage domain is limited; however, control of the length of pulses in the time domain can be precise. Encoding data in the time domain may be more accurate and more efficient than converting signals into binary radix. The transformative idea in this invention is a technique for performing computation on time-encoded analog values directly with ordinary CMOS digital logic. This technology is suitable for applications in digital or analog chips operating in domains such as image processing and signal processing in general. This technology could also be applied to approximate computing applications and operations that tolerate some degree of uncertainty (such as video processing, image tagging).",

Among the methods employed for tracking the six-degrees-of-freedom (d.o.f.) position and orientation of a device, vision-aided inertial navigation is one of the most prominent, primarily due to its high precision and low cost. VINS have been successfully applied to spacecraft, automotive, and personal localization, demonstrating real-time performance.\n\nResearchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a method using Iterative Kalman Smoother (IKS) for tracking the 3D motion of a mobile device in real-time. Specifically, this technology utilizes a sliding window-based estimator to track the 3D motion of a VINS system in real-time. In contrast to existing Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based approaches, this technology can better approximate the underlying nonlinear system and measurement models by re-linearizing and reprocessing them within the optimization window. Additionally, by iteratively optimizing over all measurements available, this technology can increase the convergence rate of critical parameters (e.g., IMU-camera clock drift) and improve the positioning accuracy during challenging conditions (e.g., scarcity of visual features). Furthermore, the resulting numerical stability allows for efficient implementations on resource constrained devices, such as cell phones and wearables.",

    "ip_description": "A periodic irradiation method for measuring exchange-induced relaxation rate constants to characterize tissue properties using MR spectroscopy. Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) is an emerging magnetic resonance technique that is viewed as a better and safer alternative to PET. CEST imaging has been demonstrated in mapping low-concentration metabolites such as creatine, glucose, glutamate, and changes in microenvironment properties such as temperature and pH, promising a host of in vivo application such as imaging of ischemic stroke and tumor. However, CEST MRI suffers from several limitations including long imaging time, and the qualitative nature of the contrast, which depends on chemical exchange rate, concentration of exchangeable protons, longitudinal relaxation time, and RF saturation power. Additionally, CEST imaging has a high specific absorption rate (SAR), and is highly sensitive to the magnetic field (B0). Researchers from the University of Minnesota, the University of Eastern Finland, and the University of Oulu have developed a method for enhancing sensitivity of MR to probe exchanging systems using periodic radiofrequency (RF) irradiation. In this method, by applying periodic RF pulse sequences to a region of interest, off resonance sidebands are generated, which significantly amplifies the exchange - induced relaxation rate constants when the system is in the intermediate or slow exchange regime. This enables them to enhance specific relaxation rate constants induced by exchange by altering the irradiation periods of the pulses. This feature could be used for more precise determination of the MR fundamental parameters of the sample by sequentially incrementing frequency of RF irradiation. In addition, unlike chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) technique, which is used for mapping low-concentration metabolites such as creatine, glucose, glutamate, and changes in microenvironment properties such as temperature and pH, the novel method has several technological advancements. Periodic RF irradiation results do not depend on accurate measurements of magnetic field (B0) strength, thereby limiting the variability of the imaging, and require less power deposition to the living sample (less SAR).",

All hydraulic motors and many hydraulic pumps require active valves to control flow entering and exiting the fluid chambers of the machine.

Both of these methods for changing valve timings allow for fully mechanical valve actuation, which is a more reliable method than electrical actuation. This technology offers a variety of methods to actuate the adjustable valve timing including hydraulic rotary actuators (vane or screw type), linear actuators, or electric motors coupled to gear drives. A key advantage of this technology is that the valve timing can be created using a fixed geometry, such as a simple valve plate (that is low cost), and the variability comes from angularly adjusting that fixed geometry.

However, stent placement can result in complications such as stent migration, ingrown tissue around stent, infection, necrosis, all of which mandate the removal of the stent. Currently, there is no specific tool designed for removing central airway stents. Interventional pulmonologists end up using standard forceps that do not work well with the unique mechanical and geometrical properties of stents. This in turn, results in longer surgery time to capture or destroy the stent in order to remove it. Sometimes the surgery is aborted and the imperfect stent is left implanted. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a device for placement, repositioning or removal of central airway (i.e., trachea and main bronchi) stents using either a flexible or rigid bronchoscopy. This device uses a stent gripping mechanism with the appropriate range of force required to detach a stent from tracheal/bronchial tissue and to transport across tracheal/bronchial cavity to remove it. This new device was designed to withstand the mechanical and geometrical properties of airway stents to allow for their removal. By having a dedicated tool for removal and simplifying the removal process, the ability to induce less procedural trauma is greatly improved.",

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor found in dogs, particularly in large breeds where occurrence can be as high as 20%. Although effective treatment is available if the cancer is caught early (amputation, irradiation, chemotherapy) there are no safe, early diagnostic tests. Furthermore, osteosarcomas are highly aggressive cancer and micrometastasis occurs in up to 90% of dogs, emphasizing the importance of close monitoring following treatment. Unfortunately, the current methods to assess dogs for relapse are multiple radiographs or CT scans every three to six months respectively. There is a clear need for a simple, low risk method to detect canine osteosarcoma for use in diagnostics as well as after diagnosis and/or remission in order to inform treatment decisions in a timely manner. Dr. Jaime Modiano\u2019s lab at the University of Minnesota used a method they previously developed (UMN Case No. 20170056) to identify a differential biomarker signature for osteosarcoma in dogs. The biomarker consists of a panel of exactly six, cell free nucleic-acid biomarkers that can be collected from a simple, minimally invasive blood sample. The biomarkers were identified using samples collected from dogs with osteosarcoma as compared to dogs with no evidence of disease, other tumors or other diseases in order to create a test that was sensitive and specific for osteosarcoma.

The method identifies signatures containing multiple biomarkers and accounts for the heterogeneity between cancer cells in the same tumor and between patients with the same cancer. The approach uses xenograft models, allowing discrimination between biomarker changes in the host and in the disease. The method identifies RNA biomarkers in exosomes which can be recovered from a blood sample. Precision diagnostics are among the unmet medical needs that are required to achieve efficient and cost-effective personalized health care. Specifically, robust methods are needed to uncover biomarkers that serve as accurate predictors of risk, early detection, prognosis, and companion diagnostics for individualized therapies. Currently, biomarker discovery results in identification of single markers. While initially promising, these standalone markers often fail due to the heterogeneity observed within tumors in individual patients and among different patients with the same type of cancer. Dr. Jaime Modiano\u2019s lab at the University of Minnesota developed complementary methods to identify more robust, multi-biomarker signatures for cancers using xenografted tumor cells. One method is the use of gene cluster expression summary scores that account for coordinated regulation of multiple genes, overcoming deficiencies of single biomarkers. The second is the use of reconstructed hybrid genomes (mouse host and tumor donor species) and bioinformatics approaches to identify mRNAs expressed exclusively in the tumor cells (donor) and mRNAs expressed exclusively in supporting stromal cells (host). These methods can be used for virtually any tumor for which there are cell lines or patient isolates that grow as xenografts (which reflect disease variability).

In cold climate regions, ice formation on turbine blades (accretion) poses significant challenges for wind turbine systems. Ice accretion on turbine blades and irregular shedding during wind turbine operation lead to load imbalance and excessive, unpredictable turbine vibration. Accretion of ice also affects the aerodynamic properties of the turbine, which significantly impacts its efficiency. Consequently, such icing events result in severe energy losses. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a software that enables forecasts for energy losses of wind turbines caused by icing. The underlying model uses temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, or other weather forecast parameters as initial inputs to predict the forthcoming meteorological icing event. Based on the relationship between the meteorological icing event and typical icing duration (i.e., icing duration derived from historical data), the software can estimate the duration of the wind turbine icing event, and further forecast the turbine energy loss during the event with turbine power curve as input. The underlying model is self-adjusted, relying on evaluating each passed icing event for more general application to wind farms in various geographical environments.

Although prescription opioid analgesics, such as morphine, fentanyl, hydrocodone and oxycodone, are the gold standard for management of chronic, post-surgical and post-traumatic pain, drug abuse, addiction and respiratory depression constitute a huge, current societal problem. Targeting non-opioid analgesic or anti-hyperalgesic targets represents an effective method to avoid those problems.

Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a series of strategically substituted agmatine compositions selectively targeting NMDA receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) to avoid motor and memory side effects. These compounds have been proven to reduce chronic pain without opioid addiction in preclinical models. Agmatine selectively antagonizes NR2B, exhibiting inhibitory effects on chronic pain without the associated motor toxicity. In addition, agmatine reduces or prevents opioid-induced tolerance and dependence. However, agmatine is highly polar and cannot cross the blood brain barrier.

    "ip_description": "A method of using a block copolymer comprising PCL and a stretchable amorphous block such as P(\u03b2M\u03b4VL) or random P(CL-co-DLLA) for creating extruded structures with bioactive ingredients. Biodegradable thermoplastic materials are highly attractive for a variety of applications including medical devices loaded with bioactive agents. However, fabrication of thermoplastic, biodegradable elastomers into devices via thermoprocessing methods (such as extrusion and molding) or 3D printing typically requires heating above 100\u00b0C, which degrades most bioactive agents. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a biodegradable, thermoplastic block copolymer that can be thermoprocessed below 60\u00b0C. By combining semi-crystalline polycaprolactone (PCL) blocks and an amorphous and highly stretchable block, such as a poly \u03b2-methyl-\u03b4-valerolactone P(\u03b2M\u03b4VL) block or a random poly(caprolactone-co-D,L-lactide) (P(CL-co-DLLA)) block, copolymers with attractive biodegradability, elastomeric, and melting properties are achieved. The unique material properties enable low-temperature molding and extrusion of structures loaded with bioactive materials, whose functional properties are preserved. This material could potentially be used for implantable products in the biomedical field. Lastly, the biodegradable nature of this material makes it safe for the environment when used for non-implantable products. TRL: 3-4 Lab-scale material synthesized and its mechanical properties (modulus, stretchability, and reversibility) have been characterized. Experiments to confirm biodegradability and non-cytotoxicity have been conducted. Researchers have successfully 3D printed using this material at 60\u00b0C. Experiments to encapsulate, retain, and preserved-bioactivity of a model enzyme have also been performed.",

    "ip_description": "A method for cryopreservation of large (100-1000micron dia.) biological samples while improving cell viability. Cryopreservation of immortalized cell lines and other biological samples is routine in many biomedical labs using conventional cryopreservation approaches such as controlled rate freezing (1 K/min). These biological samples are often smaller than 100 micron in diameter. However, for larger biological samples (>100 micron dia.) existing cryopreservation techniques are ineffective; slow cooling and warming rates due to large sample volumes result in cell injury and death. Therefore, new techniques to effectively preserve large biological samples such as embryos, cell aggregates, germplasm, tissues, etc. are needed. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel high throughput cryopreservation system for biological samples in the 100 - 2000 micron size range. Using a combination of new printing, sorting, and warming techniques, the researchers have successfully demonstrated vitrification and crystallization-free thawing of droplets with 1000x higher volume than that is demonstrated with currently available techniques. The system includes a \"pick & print\" method, which solves the tip blocking issue associated with conventional printing methods, for rapid placement of samples into cryopreservation chambers. Ultrafast cooling to vitrify samples is achieved by dropping the samples onto a cryogenic copper dish. This in turn, allows usage of toxic cryoprotective agents (CPA) at lower concentrations (<3 M). Next, a new nanoparticle-assisted laser warming method is used to rapidly rewarm these millimeter-sized biosamples and overcome ice formation and resulting injury. Finally, a microfluidic sorting platform was developed to handle and sort large quantities of biomaterials at different stages of cryopreservation procedures, thereby improving the efficiency. Applications may include cryopreserved storage, banking and reconstitution of cells and aggregates (e.g. pancreatic islets), embryos or oocytes (e.g.. vertebrate biomedical models) from important farmed or endangered species.",

    "ip_description": "A method to capture one or more analytes using polymers to enable multiplex quantitative detection by surface-enhanced Raman scattering. Mycotoxins are small molecule toxins produced from fungi that contaminate a wide variety of crops. These small molecules can be extremely carcinogenic to humans, posing dangerous hazards in food production and consumption even at low concentrations. Detecting mycotoxins traditionally employs the use of specific affinity agents. These detection methods, however, are expensive, do not offer the opportunity to detect a multitude of toxins in complex matrices, and are often qualitative. To address this gap, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a new method for capturing and detecting small molecule toxin targets such as mycotoxins. This method utilizes linear polymers, with commercially available monomers, as capturing agents for various small molecules. Using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), a single polymer affinity agent can facilitate multiplex detection of a class of molecules through less-specific interactions than traditional affinity agents. In other words, by providing fingerprint spectra for various targets, one can easily detect more than one target mycotoxin in relevant complex matrices. Lastly, polymer affinity agents exhibit heightened flexibility in solution, thus enabling optimal polymer-target binding that is not achievable when pre-anchored to the substrate.",

Soft tissue expanders have been widely used for the purposes of reconstructive surgery. New skin is grown adjacent to the surgical site through the use of an implantable expander device which stimulates skin growth by applying a sustained stretch. The new skin is useful from a surgical perspective because it expands the area that can be covered by local flap grafts.

Urodynamic tests are used to diagnose patients who may have urinary incontinence (UI) or other lower urinary tract symptoms. These tests may involve measurement of pressure in and around the urinary bladder (cystometrography), nerve and muscle function (electromyography), and flow rates (uroflowmetry). Currently available catheters for pressure measurements, however, can only measure pressure at a single point in the urethra and cannot be used for real-time measurements. In addition, catheters currently available in the market cannot be used for recording urethral pressure profiles during provocative manoeuvers, such as coughing and val salva. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a novel sensor system for urethral catheter that is capable of simultaneously measuring pressure distribution in the urethra and neural signals from urethral sphincters. With an array of pressure sensors along its length, and an electromyography (EMG) recording electrode that can be positioned at the urogenital diaphragm, this urethral catheter enables concurrent measurement of distributed urethral occlusive pressures and sphincter EMG. The flexibility and dual-modality of the sensor system enables real-time measurement of urethral pressure distribution during provocative actions such as coughing and val salva maneuvers. The sensor strip can be significantly bent during urethral insertion into the body. The developed sensor has important clinical applications in urodynamic testing and potentially in other in-vivo biomedical catheter applications. Parasitic capacitance noise expected during measurement procedure is addressed using novel reference measurements. This novel catheter can provide significantly improved urodynamic diagnosis for addressing urinary incontinence, help determine structural and neurological causes of urinary incontinence, provide instantaneous and continuous measurements of functional urethral length, and help in determining appropriate rational procedures for surgical intervention.",

Invisible thermoplastic teeth aligners are an increasingly popular method for orthodontic teeth alignment correction as these aligners are, unlike traditional fixed braces, aesthetically pleasing, convenient and easy to wear and remove. Currently, these aligners work mostly by displacement-control, with the forces applied to the teeth largely unknown. In addition, these aligners are sequentially replaced on a standard schedule based on average patient response and not based on individual response, which can lead to slow, painful, ineffective treatment with suboptimal results or even dire consequences. Improved understanding and control of the forces delivered to teeth can improve the efficiency of tooth movement, patient comfort, safety and outcome. Prof. Alex Fok\u2019s research group at the University of Minnesota have developed a system and method for measuring strains and subsequent changes in mechanical properties of orthodontic teeth aligners. In this system, invisible fluorescent speckles are included in the transparent teeth aligner. The method involves sequentially acquiring digital images of the aligner over time, and analyzing them using digital image correlation (DIC) and finite element analysis (FEA) techniques to extract useful mechanical responses of the aligner. These mechanical responses can then be used to understand the various forces at play (within the aligner and between the teeth and the aligner) and changes in the mechanical properties of the teeth and aligner on a patient-to-patient basis.

Early and sensitive detection of meningiomas: Use of a unique biomarker signature to diagnose meningiomas bypasses the requirement for tumors to have grown to increased size for visual scanning approaches. Minimally invasive and cost effective: Biomarkers can be detected in serum obtained from a simple blood draw. Potential for improved patient outcomes: Development of a minimally invasive, sensitive and affordable diagnostic tool facilitates broad patient accessibility as well as early and frequent testing. Although meningiomas account for 53.1% of all non-malignant brain and other CNS tumors, there are no specific biomarkers for early diagnosis or prognosis. Because of this, doctors rely on visual diagnostic approaches that can only detect tumors above a certain size threshold, which delays diagnosis and increases the risk of poor outcomes. Drs. Nurten Saydam and Okay Saydam at the University of Minnesota identified 14 proteins that show consistent differential expression patterns in the blood serum of patients with meningiomas. These biomarkers have the potential to serve as a diagnostic protein signature for meningiomas, facilitating minimally invasive, early tumor detection. Most CNS tumors are currently diagnosed primarily via radiology-based modalities like CT or MRI scans followed by validation with genetic or IHC-based diagnostic markers. The major challenge with these approaches is that the tumors can be detected only when they reach a certain size, which increases risk to the patient as tumors can mutate over time to malignant forms. This technology encompasses the application of identified biomarker signatures to diagnose meningiomas as well as their transition from benign to malignant forms. When detected early the 10-year survival rate of meningioma patients 20 - 44 years old is 77% and 39% in patients older than 75 years.

The method involves transfection of a fiber-modified plasmid library and a fiberless adenoviral DNA-TPC in Cre-expressing 293 cells. Using in-cell Cre recombination and fiberless adenovirus greatly simplifies the library-making steps, and the fiberless adenovirus suppresses expansion of unnecessary adenovirus vectors. The novel method can produce a high quality live adenovirus library, which could enable the development of targeted adenovirus vectors for a variety of medical applications, including potential for systemic delivery. Adenovirus has very high in vitro and in vivo transduction efficiency compared to other viral and non-viral gene transfer methods, so its application to various library works should benefit many fields.

A hardware-based processor uses camera image data, inertial measurement unit (IMU) data and odometry data indicative of scale information to estimate the VINS position and orientation.\n\nExisting ground vehicle localization methods are restricted to only 2D localization. Attempts to improve accuracy in 3D ground vehicle localization leveraged recent advances in vision-aided inertial navigation systems (VINS). However, the VINS technology suffered unexpected performance degradation due to unobservable directions caused by certain restricted motions of ground vehicles (e.g., straight-line motion or lack of rotational motion). This new technology addresses the degradation issue and improves localization accuracy in 3 dimensions (x,y,z) when applied on ground vehicles. It applies to all VINS estimators that 1) apply a stochastic constraint that constrains motion to a manifold (e.g., a plane) and 2) incorporate odometry information (e.g., wheel encoder data). Using additional sources of information, this system achieves significantly higher positioning accuracy while operating in real-time on a commercial-grade mobile device.\n\n*   Prototype dev. Working prototype demonstrated on commercial-grade platforms tested in both indoor and outdoor environments.\n\nBenefits\n--------\n\n*   Improved accuracy in 3-dimensions (x,y,z) as compared to standard VINS localization for ground vehicles\n*   Stochastic constraint robustly compensates for vibrations of robotic platforms\n*   Achieves significantly higher positioning accuracy\n*   Operates in real-time on commercial-grade mobile devices\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n*   Vision-aided Inertial Navigation System (VINS)\n*   Ground vehicle localization in 3D space\n*   Low-frequency wheel-encoder data renders scale observable\n*   Hardware-based processor\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Robotics, ground robots\n*   Autonomous vehicles\n*   Module on mobile device/robot",

The system employs a custom algorithm to auto-register 3D bone models to 2D fluoroscopic images for quantifying 3D joint kinematics. Such analysis and 3D shape reconstruction from 2D x-ray images are important for different orthopedic applications. The auto-tracking program measures 3D in vivo joint kinematics from radiographic images (single and/or biplane) using model-image registration. Initial estimates for bone position and orientation are obtained manually and the 3D bone model is projected on the image plane. The algorithm then minimizes the difference between the projected bone model and fluoroscopy image.\n\nCurrent fluoroscopic motion tracking techniques face some major barriers. Manual data processing for model-based tracking typically requires manual shape matching of a subject-specific 3D bone model to each fluoroscopy image. This manual processing of dynamic fluoroscopy task is tedious and time consuming, so researchers often process only a few selected frames instead of the entire dynamic fluoroscopy sequence. These shortcuts impair its application and clinical translation outside the research environment. This new auto-tracking software measures 3D in vivo joint kinematics. The algorithm improves efficiency of fluoroscopic motion tracking techniques and reduces novice manual shape matching time. Such technology offers greater automation of these processes and can significantly accelerate applied and translational research in the field.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "A new biofeedback hand grip device is used with a custom computer game to assess muscle function in patients with muscle diseases, particularly children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This novel muscle strength and fatigue assessment tool is quantifiable, can be performed by patients at all levels of muscle disease progression (including non-ambulatory patients) and is fun and motivating for the patient. The device features a grip sensor embedded in a custom handgrip piece designed to fit a child\u2019s hand. When the patient squeezes the device, the sensor records the isometric grip force of the patient and sends it wirelessly to a host computer (tablet). The tablet displays a fun and motivating video game where the patient performs a brief fatiguing exercise. A wide range of protocols can be specified, which may be useful for research or for clinical diagnostic means. The novel game-based tool encourages muscle disease patients to follow a prescribed protocol to train/fatigue the muscle. Furthermore, an assessment tool that is fun for the patient may limit the dropout of patients from trials where assessments were too stressful. Existing neuromuscular diseases (e.g., muscular dystrophy) muscle function tests are difficult to quantify and are often limited to ambulatory patients and/or those with relatively mild disease. Some therapies are susceptible to declining motivation, where doing the test can be depressing/demotivating for patients with DMD because they immediately see that their performance was worse than before. Current solutions do not motivate patients to perform to their maximal ability and do not allow a specific muscle-fatiguing protocol that can be used for research or for clinical diagnostics. This new medical device provides a simple, engaging upper-limb assessment tool that measures muscle strength and fatigue in children with DMD. The new biofeedback grip sensor is combined with a game-based interface to motivate patients to complete maximal and fatiguing grip protocols. The new device uniquely enables customized assessment and fatiguing exercise protocols. The level of force for the game can be tailored to the disease or to each patient\u2014and can be done without the patient knowing. By adjusting game parameters as disease progresses over time, the game is equally easy to play at all visits, regardless of actual force production. This way, the child can achieve the same\u2014or an even higher\u2014score over time, and can even compete against friends and family. This competitive aspect improves patient experience and compliance with the exercise protocol and motivates the child to keep playing.",

    "ip_description": "An autonomous data corruption filter algorithm for recovering 3D structure of an object from 2D images. Recent outlier-robust methods have been proposed for camera location estimation and as a preprocessing step to improve their subsequent estimator. The state-of-the-art before this disclosure is 1DSfM algorithm. It\u2019s convergence to the global minimum, however, is not guaranteed, and it results in low inconsistency scores, producing inaccurate measures of corruption. Other methods such as least unsquared deviations (LUD) algorithm and the ShapeFit algorithm have shown limited ability of removing outliers. Researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed an autonomous data corruption filter algorithm that significantly improves the accuracy of camera location recovery and 3D reconstruction. The algorithm, which can be applied to common 3D reconstruction pipelines as a preprocessor, detects the corrupted pairwise directions of pairs of cameras whose locations are unknown. This data cleaning procedure significantly removes the uncertainty resulting from the corrupted data. This algorithm does not solve the heuristic optimization problem like 1DSfM, thus it does not suffer from convergence to local minima. Instead, it uses a theoretically-guaranteed statistic to measure the corruption, and it is easier to implement. By removing corrupted data in a reliable and interpretable way, this intellectual property significantly improves the camera location estimation accuracy when combining with methods such as LUD or ShapeFit.",

    "ip_description": "A new navigation method achieves simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) of large areas on a mobile device. This technology performs both localization (determining position and orientation of an object in 3D space) and mapping in a single computing thread using a square-root inverse form of a Schmidt-Kalman Filter (SR-ISF) within a Vision-aided Inertial Navigation System (VINS). The VINS produces images of reference frame poses along a trajectory, a motion sensor provides motion data of the poses and a processor estimates the position and orientation of the poses. This technology could be implemented as part of a VINS solution with applications in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) in large spaces as well as robot/human localization and navigation. Vision-aided Inertial Navigation System (VINS) has successfully demonstrated real-time performance on robots, spacecraft, automotive and personal localization (e.g., on smartphones or laptops). In computer vision, localization and mapping are separate processes. A Kalman filter is often used for real-time localization and navigation while maps are built offline. Currently, running both a filter and a slim mapping module on mobile devices, and particularly sharing information between the two processes, is a challenge. This new algorithm (inverse form of the Schmidt-Kalman filter) solves this problem by providing filtering and mapping in a single thread.

FAP is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts, in 90% of epithelial tumors including common cancers like breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, pancreatic, skin and some soft tissue and bone sarcomas. FAP activity contributes to tumorigenesis and aggressiveness through degradation of the extracellular matrix and activation of growth factors. Together, FAP is an attractive target for research to elucidate tumor pathogenicity and as a putative target for therapeutic intervention. The LeBeau laboratory used an antibody phage display library to develop an antibody (clone B12) that selectively binds FAP and FAP-expressing cells in a variety of applications. B12 recognizes FAP positive cells as evaluated by ELISA, SPR, flow cytometry and microscopy. Furthermore, B12 can be used as a live imaging fluorescent probe in tumor xenograft models in mice by conjugating the antibody to a near-infrared dye. The cross-reactivity of B12 to both murine and human FAP proteins allows its use in murine preclinical cancer models and subsequent translation to relevant human cancer research and therapeutic development. Furthermore, B12 shows rapid internalization by tumor cells, a property lacking in another anti-FAP antibody that failed in clinical trials (sibrotuzumab).

The technology works through two engineered distinct fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors. The first of these biosensors measures intermolecular interactions between separate tau proteins, allowing a readout of oligomerization. The second biosensor uses single-molecule FRET (smFRET), to assess conformational changes within single tau proteins. Combined, the readout from these molecular probes will facilitate identification of compounds that inhibit tau oligomerization, and provide immediate insights into mechanism of action. Another major advantage of these biosensors is that they are functional in live cells, allowing screening to be carried out in a biologically relevant context and without the need for costly and time consuming purification protocols. Despite decades of research, there are currently no effective therapies for tauopathies, a class of neurodegenerative disorders that include Alzheimer\u2019s disease. While recent studies have indicated that tau oligomers are the primary toxic species in these diseases, very few clinical compounds that target tau itself are being pursued. To fill this gap, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed biosensors that monitor tau oligomer and monomer conformations that can be used as a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform to identify novel compounds that modulate tau and attenuate associated toxicity.

A new process creates uniquely functional/active textiles using multi-material 3D printing combined with traditional textile equipment (e.g., circular knitting machine). The process involves 3D printing novel, yarn-like filaments with strategically varying properties (elasticity/stiffness, conductivity, activation, surface properties, etc.) that can later be formed into a textile/garment.\n\nThis functional compression garment clothing activates upon touching the body and self-fits to the body without a power source. The SMA activated compression garment is passive and loose fitting when cool (i.e., ambient room temperatures or even freezing temperatures) and activates to apply pressure on the body as it warms to skin temperature. This approach enables new, dynamic, wearable compression garments with controllable activation and low effort donning and doffing.\n\nThis SMA compression garment provides dynamic compression for therapeutic relief. The garment features nickel titanium (NiTi) alloy SMA spring actuators that contract with heat to provide compressive force when electrical power is applied. A novel tension-limiting switch gives patients independent control of compression by applying electrical power to SMA actuators to provide compressive force. The tension switch can also prevent patients from applying an incorrect amount of power and/or overheating the SMA springs. The unique feedback mechanism of the tension switch consumes no electrical power; it instead uses the mechanical properties of its material.\n\nThis technology uses SMA knitted actuators in a novel way to create self-fitting, on-body clothing and wearables. The technology leverages large and controllable displacements, and variable stiffness qualities to make textiles that are compliant and flexible in their inactive state, and become stiffer in their active state. SMA textiles are temperature sensitive and could actuate using the body\u2019s thermal energy or other forms of heating. This textile could be used in conjunction with high-force SMA textiles in a single garment to provide the necessary fitting for appropriate force output.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of Minnesota have compiled a library of 1,600 analgesics consisting of several classes of molecules and the synthetic intermediates used to create them by chemical reactions. The chemical compounds detailed in the library fall into the following broad categories: agonists, which stimulate a response from cells, antagonists, which obtain a desired outcome by blocking a response from cells, or affinity labels, which alter the mechanisms of chemical reactions inside the body to a desired effect. The majority of the compounds in this library have applications for pain relief or pain treatment in chronic pain sufferers. Other uses of the chemical compounds in this library include type-2 diabetes, obesity, compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, cancer, and depression. The compound library would be an ideal tool to screen for drug candidates with pain relief activity. This library of analgesics contains compounds developed over forty-five years of research. This library contains the analgesic compounds characterized by chemical structure and biological activity. Several compounds have shown potential analgesic activity without the side effects associated with opioids. The results, entered into a ChemBioFinder database, are easy to access and analyze. The compounds in this library could form the basis of new pain medications and treatments of other diseases with less harmful side effects than current opioid based medications. Features of Opioid Library of 1600 Chemical Compounds with Analgesic Properties include: Library is highly focused on opioids, making it optimal to screen for compounds that have analgesic or metabolic activity; All chemical compounds and intermediates are categorized chemically and biologically to facilitate efficient screening; Compounds in library are candidates for pain relief or pain treatment applications; Library contains chemical compounds which may be useful in treating type-2 diabetes, obesity, compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, cancer, and depression.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "An E. coli strain has been genetically engineered that can convert unrefined glycerol to ethanol in a fast and high yield E. coli fermentation process. Glycerol waste (also called glycerin or glycerine) is the major waste product in biodiesel manufacturing processes, and this E. coli strain can efficiently convert this biodiesel waste into ethanol, a type of biofuel. Existing processes utilize E. coli for bacterial fermentation to convert glycerol to ethanol, but at much lower yields and much slower rates. The E. coli grows on the glycerol and produces ethanol from the glycerol. Under oxygen limiting conditions, the E. coli strain grows slowly on the glycerin while producing large quantities of ethanol during fermentation. Alternatively, the strain grows quickly on the biodiesel waste when oxygen is in abundance while the Escherichia coli fermentation process is slowed. Beneficially, the E. coli strains that grow quickest in the oxygen abundant conditions also convert the most glycerol to ethanol under oxygen limiting conditions. This allows for the evolution of the designed e. coli strain to maximize cellular ethanol production by growing the culture under oxygen abundant conditions. BENEFITS OF E. COLI FERMENTATION OF ETHANOL FROM BIODIESEL WASTE: Efficient: high yields ( ~90%) and fast rate of conversion of glycerol to ethanol Cellular ethanol production utilizes toxic biodiesel waste (glycerol waste by-products) Escherichia coli fermentation converts glycerol (or glycerin or glycerine) into another biofuel (ethanol) Beneficial evolution of the designed strain results from bacterial growth resulting in improved microbial fermentation by e. coli batches.",

    "ip_description": "Organic photovoltaics, a solar cell technology, can provide flexible, wearable, lightweight and low cost solar panels for personal electronics. Organic solar cells have lower production costs because the cells are printed onto a substrate. Commercially available organic solar cells possess less than 3 percent power conversion efficiency (conversion of light into electricity, a higher power conversion efficiency is better). By comparison, the latest experimental silicon-based solar cells obtain power conversion efficiencies of up to 40.7% with commercial solar cells possessing power conversion efficiencies of less than 20 percent. The limitation of silicon-based solar cell technology is an extremely high manufacturing and material cost.\n\nThe graded heterojunction technology can increase the efficiency of organic solar cells and has the potential to dominate the estimated 1 billion dollar market for organic solar cell devices. The architecture combines the small electron distance of the dispersed heterojunction architecture (decreases the interference with the solar cell material) and the charge gradient of bilayer technology (decreases the backflow of electrons). Since the manufacturing process can be performed in a single pass, this architecture has the potential to lower the production cost while increasing the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells. Four percent power conversion efficiency has been demonstrated with more research conducted to improve the efficiency.\n\nBENEFITS AND FEATURES OF PHOTOVOLTAIC ORGANIC SOLAR CELLS\n\n* Power conversion rates of 4% with the potential to be an underlying architecture for future organic photovoltaic solar cells\n* The combination of a bilayer and dispersed heterojunction architecture greatly simplifies the fabrication process and can reduce manufacturing costs.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of Minnesota have created an infection control system to destroy bacteria and microbes with ultraviolet (UV) light to sterilize catheter access points. This system functions as both a dilator at the access site to allow delivery of treatment, and as a sterilant, periodically transmitting UV light into the catheter body and adjacent tissues. UV light sterilizes materials by using a wavelength of light that breaks the molecular bonds in microbe DNA. This either destroys them, rendering them harmless, or prohibits their growth and reproduction, taking away their ability to cause infection.\n\nCentral venous access using a catheter or central line is a common medical practice used in hospitals to deliver drugs and treatment. One of the greatest risks of using a central line is severe infection of the access site, caused by microbes such as bacteria. Infections in patients undergoing surgery can lead to major complications and potentially death. Post-operative infections also lead to longer hospital stays and are costly for both patients and health care providers. Because of this, it is imperative for hospital staff and physicians to keep the access site sterilized. This UV light medical device enables repeated, intermittent, and on-demand sterilization of the access site to prevent infections. This device has applications for preventing infection in any surgery or procedure involving catheters, which have become increasingly popular with the trend towards less invasive procedures.\n\n*   Prevents dangerous infections due to bacteria and other microorganisms by destroying them with UV light\n*   Effective sterilization of central venous and other access points\n*   Allows repeated, intermittent, on-demand sterilization of catheter and skin with UV light\n*   Infection control device is designed for use with any catheter set\n*   Also functions to replace dilators used to open incisions to fit catheters\n*   Cost-effectively addresses high-impact, high-cost issue",

    "ip_description": "Radio Spectrum Management May Not Provide Sufficient Bandwidth. Growing wireless applications, driven primarily by mobile broadband, are creating a challenging environment where many experts predict that the most innovative radio frequency spectrum management policies and technologies may not provide sufficient bandwidth. ProTOMAC (Proactive Transmit Opportunity Detection at the MAC Layer) is a spectrum sensing cognitive radio algorithm capable of detecting unused channel capacity (transmission margin) and intelligently adding traffic. The spectrum analysis process optimizes the power of transmission for a secondary opportunistic user so that quality of service for primary network users is maintained and overall spectrum use is maximized. Sensing the unused signal in the interference temperature is the most important step. All current opportunistic spectrum access techniques for cognitive radio work at the physical layer using methods like energy detection, cyclostationarity signal detection, multi-resolution spectrum sensing, etc. This is the first approach to this problem at the Media Access Control (MAC) Layer level of the OSI model. In other words, the data packets of the primary system are used to identify and exploit the transmission opportunities for the secondary system. The technology also allows for much higher power communication compared to ultrawideband (UWB) communication technologies. ProtoMAC has the potential to increase capacity in new and existing wireless spectrum management systems by as much as 70%. ProTOMAC is a flexible architecture that implements a transmit margin, a concept inspired by the FCC proposal of an interference temperature (IT) metric. ProtoMAC is applicable to all bandwidth intensive applications, including fixed and mobile applications in rural or urban areas. Another application is in chipset (ASIC) or transceiver DSP (low-level software implementation) and in addition to working in IEEE 802.22, is backwards-compatible with IEEE 802.11. BENEFITS AND FEATURES OF THE SPECTRUM SENSING COGNITIVE RADIO ENHANCEMENT: ProTOMAC monitors changes in network management statistics, optimizing throughput (up to 70% increase in capacity) while ensuring negligible interference with other users. The software-based technology works in the media access control layer (MAC layer); the technology will work with a wide range of existing, cost effective radios. Applications in Chipset (ASIC) or transceiver DSP (low-level software implementation) and can work in IEEE 802.11. Useable in wireless broadband (fixed and mobile) for commercial or military purposes including rural broadband data, video and telephone service.",

    "ip_name": "Corn Stover Agglomerates for Oil Absorption",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "A lightweight, biodegradable oil absorbent material created from corn stover shows desirable oil sorbency characteristics, making it an effective alternative to clay-based sorbents. Dust-free corn stover agglomerates are produced by a gentle agglomeration and rolling action using a novel, two part bonding system that forms a web onto which additional particles adhere and roll upon. The web is formed as a result of crosslinking of liquid and solid portions of binding system. The cellular structure of the corn stover is conserved: particles remain intact in an undensified, \u201cnon-collapsed\u201d state, allowing oil and other hydrocarbon fluids to wick into its porous structure. The ground corn stover is gently agglomerated into 4 to 8 mm beads with a very high open porosity, creating pore surfaces and pore volume for oil and other liquids to be captured. Conventional technology, such as compression pelleting, uses high compression dies where material is forced under friction through a die cavity. This new process uses gentle growth agglomeration, where properly prepared feed is self-agglomerated in a balling drum, disc or tire with significant emphasis on minimal densification, assuring the delicate corn stover fibers are attached to one another with pendular bridging. Overall, the process creates agglomerate sooner, at lower moisture and with superior green strength compared to single stage binders. Compared to conventional clay based absorbents, agglomerated corn stover fiber has over 5 times more sorbency, significantly less ash, and provides more recoverable energy. Benefits and features include: Lightweight, biodegradable oil absorbent material from corn stover; Alternative to clay-based sorbents; Agglomerated corn stover fiber has over 5 times more sorbency, significantly less ash, and provides more recoverable energy than conventional clay based absorbents; Process creates agglomerate sooner, at lower moisture and with superior green strength compared to single stage binders; Gentle agglomeration and rolling action using two part bonding system; Conserves cellular structure: particles remain intact in an undensified, \u201cnon-collapsed\u201d state, allowing oil and other hydrocarbon fluids to wick into its porous structure; Very high open porosity; Simple process uses commonly available agricultural equipment.",

This method does not require the downstream separation and recycling that are currently limiting factors in creating plants with small capital investments. The improved process includes the addition of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) as an absorbent that optimizes the kinetics of ammonia production. This inexpensive additive absorbs ammonia from the gas phase, allowing the reaction to continue at a high rate without reaching equilibrium and improves yield in reactors that currently use the Haber-Bosch process. This technique may allow distributed small scale ammonia production as opposed to current methods that require one consolidated plant. Ammonia is used primarily in fertilizers, coolants and fuel, and has drastically altered agriculture in the past century. The Haber-Bosch process has been predominantly used to make ammonia, and involves combining nitrogen and hydrogen gas under high pressures and temperatures in large, capital-intensive plants. In order to be highly economical, tremendous capital and energy costs must be incurred to build and sustain a plant large enough to supply multiple states with ammonia. The efficiency of ammonia production must be increased significantly before it can be synthesized on a small scale while remaining cost-effective.

Traditionally, power transformers are large and heavy due to the massive amounts of steel and copper windings contained inside of them. Due to operation at low-frequencies, the transformers are massive in size. Today's high-frequency transformers are smaller than the low-frequency transformers, but require multiple semiconductor switches and are less efficient. Through the complex switching, the transformer can input an AC input waveform and output an AC waveform.\n\nResearchers at the University of Minnesota have developed a high-frequency transformer topology with a dramatic reduction in the number of semiconductor switches that enable much simpler operation and greater reliability for high-frequency transformers. The high-frequency transformer can be implemented with only two semiconductor switches with a simpler on/off operation, which improves reliability. The conversion from AC to AC is direct, so there is no DC-conversion step, which eliminates the need for a capacitor and reduces overall weight and increases efficiency. The smaller size makes the power generator useful for wind turbines, power electronics or anywhere where transformer storage space is scarce, such as naval vessels and aircraft. Additionally, the transformer can be integrated into plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) as a bi-directional interface for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications, which would allow the power grid to use PHEVs as distributed energy storage for a smart grid.\n\nFEATURES AND BENEFITS OF THE COMPACT POWER TRANSFORMER DESIGN:\n\n*   A hundred-fold smaller and lighter than the current power transformers, e.g. a reduction from 35 tons to 450 lbs. in some applications\n*   Reduces the number of switches ten-fold which reduces complexity and reliability issues\n*   Efficiency only slightly lower than the current, large low-frequency transformer\n*   No intermediate DC-conversion step, therefore no bulky capacitor is used\n*   Applications in wind energy, power electronics, hybrid electric vehicles",
