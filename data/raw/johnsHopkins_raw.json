    "ip_description": "Invention provides compositions and methods useful for the diagnosis and treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI). Demonstrates the feasibility of using a multiomics approach to discover novel, noninvasive markers of AKI that are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is a strong need for the identification of biomarkers and other diagnostic tools as a means to refine risk assessment and AKI diagnosis, ultimately improving therapeutic targets. AKI occurs in approximately 10-15% of patients admitted to hospital, while its incidence in intensive care has been reported in more than 50% of patients. AKI is a serious complication in critically ill patients, associated with increased morbidity and mortality, increased hospitalization time and care cost, and long-term development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Present diagnostic measures for AKI have significant limitations and revolve around changes in serum creatinine (SCr), urine output, and requirement for kidney replacement therapy (KRT). However, change in SCr or urine output are not sensitive enough to detect early injury. In addition, SCr may increase in various clinical scenarios that require different management strategies, making the diagnosis and treatment challenging. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have identified eight protein biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral blood and reflect the severity of injury in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). It is unique because it integrates tissue transcriptomics and proteomics technologies to identify biomarkers of AKI. Because of the comprehensiveness in assessing gene expression and protein synthesis from these two technologies, this invention is able to identify multiple novel protein biomarkers of AKI at a large scale. The researchers have confirmed these proteins in the ASSESS-AKI cohort and NAKiD cohort using OLink technologies- completing the validation studies.",

    "ip_description": "This invention provides a leap forward in saturation mutagenesis called PFunkel. PFunkel is a next-generation Kunkel mutagenesis strategy that can, for the first time, efficiently and cheaply produce libraries containing user-defined mutations, including sequentially permuted genes. This technique is rapidly being adopted by academic labs and can be adopted to reinforce commercial, directed evolution service offerings. There is currently no method for creating extensive libraries with a researcher-defined mutational composition spanning across an entire gene. Further, methods to make multiple mutations and methods for site-directed mutagenesis suffer from low efficiency. The PFunkel mutagenesis method overcomes the pitfalls of current research methods. This novel method provides a simple, single tube procedure for the creation of single mutations approaching 100% efficiency, the creation of multiple mutations at high efficiency, and the creation of expansive, user-defined libraries of mutations consisting of all possible mutations of a gene or genes, or a user-defined subset of all mutations of a gene or genes. Additional advantages of this method include: \u2022 Higher efficiency than currently practiced techniques. \u2022 Method is performed in a single tube and can be executed in a single day. \u2022 Possibility to produce a novel library mutagenesis kit. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel method for mutagenesis. In this method the mutations are introduced via oligonucleotides that anneal and prime synthesis on a single- or double-stranded uracil-containing DNA template. The reaction makes use of five enzymes and undergoes multiple temperature cycles that ultimately result in double-stranded closed circular plasmid DNA ready for transformation, each molecule encoding a user-defined mutation. The protocol can be optimized for introducing one or more mutations per gene and the frequency of mutated variants approaches 100%. Importantly, the method is rapid, taking a single day and performed in a single tube.",

Existing approaches often require stacked alignment layers, patterned electrodes, or physically tilting the sample, making them cumbersome, expensive, and limited in scalability. These techniques require multi-step processes, specialized equipment, or external electric fields to maintain desired LC alignment. Therefore, there is critical need for a simple, scalable, and mask-free technique that enables high-resolution, continuous 3D alignment of liquid crystals while maintaining stability without external fields.

Personalized: Predicts location of optimal ablation or LV electrode placement for each patient. Unmet Need: Ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the setting of myocardial infarction is associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Catheter-based ablation, which has become a safe and effective first-line therapy for other types of cardiac arrhythmias, is associated with low levels of success in eliminating infarct-related VT. Low response rates are due to numerous limitations to current voltage and pace mapping techniques that often miss critical sites for ablation. Similarly, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients, yet 30% of patients fail to respond to CRT. The location of the left ventricular (LV) pacing lead plays an important role in CRT efficacy, but determining this location in a patient-specific manner is not currently possible. Therefore, there is a need for better identification of optimal targets of ablation or CRT in order to achieve better patient outcomes.",

Changes in kidney volume over time have been implicated in progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and polycystic kidney disease (PKD). In PKD, fibrosis and extensive cyst formation leads to significantly enlarged renal volume, which can be characterized by MRI. By automatically segmenting whole kidney volume, AI LOGIK therefore provides an objective, quantitative assessment of disease progression. Importantly, identifying patients with rapidly progressing disease would facilitate selection for clinical trials and treatment. Similarly, CKD is caused by a change in renal function and/or structure over time. Structural changes as assessed by MRI are important for accurate staging and inform prognosis. Beyond CKD and PKD, AI LOGIK also segments and tracks the progression of renal lesions. The system accurately localizes the lesion, classifies lesion as benign vs. malignant, and tracks lesion volume over time to assist in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning.",

    "ip_description": "Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive technique that provides the overall molecular vibrational signature of a sample. Its nondestructive nature has made it possible for in vivo imaging of cells and other small organisms. Furthermore, advances in this field have made high resolution mapping, known as Raman spectroscopy imaging (RSI), possible. However, the current set-up is slow and cumbersome, and lacks detailed information on specific molecular information. Conversely, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful analytical technique that can reveal the molecular distribution of hundreds of molecules in one single run. Current advancements have improved the overall speed making a typical MALDI imaging run less than one hour. Nonetheless, MALDI MSI cannot analyze live samples, is more destructive than RSI, and is yet to reach submicron resolution commercially. The strengths and weaknesses of RSI and MSI reveal a strong compatibility of these two techniques. Currently, most experiments that take advantage of these two techniques require two separate samples, one for RSI and another for MSI. Therefore, there is a strong need for a novel approach that may consolidate the strengths of both techniques into a functional approach that can collectively analyze one sample. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a novel workflow that allows for the same sample to be analyzed with Raman spectroscopy imaging as well as MALDI mass spectrometry imaging. This novel invention produces a combined approach that reduces sample requirements and overall sample preparation time, making it possible to effectively run combined RSI-MALDI MSI experiments on precious samples.",

    "ip_description": "The demand for lithium (Li) is rapidly increasing as their applications in energy storage increases in efficiency and popularity. It is projected that traditional lithium sources (minerals and Li-rich brines) will no longer be sufficient to meet the drastically rising demand. Alternative sources such as seawater, geothermal brines, and mine tailings are available to be explored; however, the concentration of lithium is much lower than in traditional sources, raising concerns for cost-efficiency, environmental impact, and water/energy consumption in lithium extraction, as traditional methods are already quite cumbersome and unlikely to be applicable to the alternative sources. Therefore, there is a need for a more efficient and effective means of extracting lithium from alternative sources. Inventors at Johns Hopkins have developed a novel electrochemical system that can be implemented in selective lithium-ion extractions from alternative sources with low lithium concentrations. The technology consists of three primary unit operations: 1) an electrolyzer employing a Li+-selective solid-state electrolyte membrane for conversion of Li-containing chloride solutions to lithium hydroxide and diatomic hydrogen and chlorine, 2) a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell that produces hydrochloric acid and electricity which can be used in step 1; and 3) a reactor that leaches lithium using hydrochloric acid, which can be obtained from step 2 as a byproduct. This system could close the mass balance for hydrogen and chlorine, leaving only the conversion of the lithium sources into lithium cations for battery manufacturing and other forms of energy storage.",

The risk of adverse outcomes in a catheter ablation procedure can be decreased by standardizing the procedure process and timing and by simplifying it such that it can be performed even by less experienced electrophysiologists. There is also a need for real-time navigational feedback to assist the operator in VA origin localization.

It reduces the need for experienced operators, allowing less experienced operators to rely on the system\u2019s knowledge.

    "published_date": "1/16/2025",
    "ip_description": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is responsible for regulating the brain microenvironment by tightly controlling the entry of molecules and cells into the brain. This restricted access has presented challenges in the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. As a result, only a few central nervous system disorders are currently treatable with small-molecule drug therapy. One strategy to enable drug delivery to the brain is to induce transient opening of the blood-brain barrier. Unlike transcellular transport, blood-brain barrier opening involves reversible mechanical or chemical disruption of cell junctions to allow transient paracellular transport between endothelial cells. Transient opening allows drugs to extravasate from circulation into the brain. The current standard for delivering agents to the brain involves intra-arterial injection of the hyperosmotic agent mannitol, which transiently opens the BBB. This technique has been used for several decades in both preclinical models and in the clinic to improve delivery of therapeutics. However, difficulties in reproducibility have prevented widespread use of this method in the clinic. Johns Hopkins researchers have adopted a strategy of inducing transient opening of the blood-brain barrier using membrane active peptides (MAPs). In particular, they show that melittin, a major component of the venom of the honey bee (Apis mellifera), and its sequence variants can induce transient BBB opening and overcome the limitations of current methods used in the clinic, such as hyperosmotic treatment with mannitol. Transient opening of the BBB with melittin would enable delivery of a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic agents and drug and gene delivery systems into the brain. Thus, this approach is highly versatile and could be used to increase brain penetration of existing FDA-approved therapeutics. Preclinical and experimental data is available for in vitro and in vivo studies where inventors have demonstrated that melittin enables reversible BBB opening and highlighting the diverse range of therapeutic compounds for which melittin can enhance drug delivery.",

Thus, there is a need for a sustained delivery system that provides similar efficacy with reduced side effects.

Immune checkpoint therapies have become a powerful treatment route for a wide variety of cancer types and have increased the life expectancy for patients whose disease is refractory to all other therapies. Due to variability in patient response rates, a number of different biomarkers are used to predict successful responses and inform therapeutic approaches. High levels of the immune checkpoint protein programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and high levels of tumor mutational burdens tend to produce successful treatment responses which makes these therapies effective against melanoma, breast, non-small cell lung, and bladder cancers (see UpToDate). However, the majority of patients do not experience clinical benefit from immune checkpoint therapies, and treatment durability is often limited. There is thus an urgent need for novel immune checkpoint therapies with novel mechanisms of action in order to improve the efficacy and durability of cancer treatment. Technology Overview: Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a multispecific antibody immunotherapy that simultaneously blocks PD-L1 signaling and downregulate PD-L1 expression on the surface of cells.

The gold standard of care consists of symptom relieving remedies as well as disease modifying therapies. However, there are no curative therapies for MS, and most existing disease modifying therapies are only partially effective in preventing relapses and have little impact on the accrual of disability. Furthermore, to date, MS therapeutic development efforts have primarily focused on modifying the peripheral immune response or promoting remyelination and neuroprotection in the central nervous system. One potential solution could target the underlying physiology that is altered in people with MS and have both anti-inflammatory and reparative effects, unlike other treatments that are broadly immunosuppressive and do not target pathophysiology specific to the disease. There is therefore a need for a safer, more well-tolerated drug with both anti-inflammatory and reparative effects to be developed to address this deficit in treatment of MS. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have identified a link between levels of a certain metabolite and multiple sclerosis (MS). They have discovered that levels of this metabolite can be indicative of severity of MS as well as risk of developing MS. They determined that supplementation with this metabolite reduces disease severity in an animal model of MS. In addition, they found using both human and murine oligodendrocyte precursor cells that the metabolite promoted differentiation of these cells to myelin producing oligodendrocytes. This would be beneficial in the setting of MS since this could promote repair of existing damage. The researchers envision creating an oral medication to routinely deliver the metabolite to MS patients. The inventors are currently in the pre-clinical stage of development.",

Allows for discovery and screening of novel drug targets for E. coli infection-associated lethal diarrhea in infants. The WHO Global Burden of Foodborne Diseases report estimates that >300 million illnesses and nearly 200,000 deaths are caused by enteropathogenic and enterohemorragic E. coli globally each year, mainly in infant and immunocompromised populations. Current methods of studying such infections are limited to studies in immortalized human cell lines, which do not capture the full extent of the disease mechanism. Thus, there exists a strong need to develop an in vivo model to provide the detailed information to prevent and treat this life-threatening disease. Current methods for modeling pathogen-related infantile diarrhea are limited to in vitro studies in human cell lines. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a mouse model capable of modeling the condition. The mouse strain exhibits comparable life-threatening symptoms when infected with rodent intestinal pathogens, creating an accurate model for lethal infantile diarrhea infections. The model has successfully been developed and is ready for commercialization or corporate partnerships.",

In contrast to the Cox model, the POTOMAC model is based on the random survival forest approach and has a lower risk of overfitting when handling high dimensional data. Additionally, it allows for exploration of non-linear effects and possible interactions amongst covariates. The POTOMAC model includes the consideration of a comprehensive set of 9 LMs with both traditionally reported metrics and novel lymphopenia. As such, the POTOMAC model provides an objective, disciplined approach that seeks to visualize the data in various perspectives, which is essential in the quest to understand complex data patterns in a survival prediction model and move towards consensus and unification of previously described findings.",

This accurate positioning enables accurate separation of specific layers without unwanted perforations. Corneal defects/injuries are a major cause of reversible blindness, and they can often be fixed with a corneal transplant. Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) is a cornea transplant method used when patient endothelium is healthy. DALK separates patient stroma while maintaining endothelium in order to reduce immune rejection of donor tissue. The most common method for separating stroma from endothelium is the big bubble method. However, this method suffers from the difficulty of accurately placing a cannula at the barrier between stroma and endothelium. Therefore, there is a need for development of technologies for better placement of cannula during DALK and other partial tissue dissection procedures. Proof-of-concept completed.

Scalable and translational manufacturing process. Neurotoxins are widely used in the aesthetic and therapeutic space. Among the 16 million minimally invasive plastic surgery procedures performed in 2018, injection of Botulinum Toxin Type A (Botox) accounted for over 50% (American Society of Plastic Surgeons). These substances are typically administered to patients via injection. Neuromodulators work by paralyzing muscle bodies and subsequently provide relief for migraine and, more commonly, are used to reduce signs of aging for facial aesthetics. However, the products currently on the market suffer from fast clearance from the inject site with only a 14-day maximally effective release period. This requires that the patient undergoes follow-up visits at least every 3 months. Thus, there is a need for a delivery mechanism that facilitates sustained release of the neurotoxin.

Melanin pigments have broad optical absorption and are capable of absorbing ionizing radiation. Melanin pigments also have powerful antioxidant activity and are capable of binding to a broad range of chemical compounds. Importantly, radiation energy that is absorbed by melanin is effectively translated into heat, making it potentially useful in solar thermal energy systems. Melanin is produced by animals, plants, and microorganisms. In particular, melanin-producing microorganisms provide a sustainable source of natural melanin that could be used for large scale production. However, current approaches to isolate melanin from melanotic fungi require the use of laborious efforts to isolate the melanin coat from the cell wall of fungi. Consequently, simpler, cost effective methods of isolating melanin from fungi would have widespread utility in multiple industries. The inventors discovered that the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans secretes melanin granules into microbial culture supernatant. The inventors have developed a method of isolating melanin from the cell culture supernatants of fungi, including Cryptococcus neoformans. This method uses ultracentrifugation and filtration to purify melanin granules. The inventors have validated that these granules exhibit the characteristics of melanin. Additionally, the inventors developed a method of isolating melanin from cell walls that is quicker and has similar yield compared to existing, more laborious methods.

    "ip_description": "Artificial intelligence (AI), with its ability to computationally carry out complex tasks quickly, has the potential to revolutionize many fields. However, its real-world use is currently limited by its lack of interpretability: it is difficult to understand how AI models generate their outputs. This is especially important in risk-averse fields such as medicine and autonomous driving, where an error can have substantial negative consequences. Moreover, an inability to understand the model makes error identification and correction difficult, and current models tend to achieve high performance but low interpretability, or vice versa. As a result, a model that performs well on both aspects is needed, and such a solution would facilitate the application of AI to many fields, especially those that cannot accept any level of risk. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a machine learning (ML) algorithm that can be applied to a diverse range of applications, which solves tasks similar to a game of \u201c20 question\u201d, where a series of questions are asked about an input and using the outputs to generate a prediction. The structure of the queries depends on the task and is user defined to be meaningful for the task at hand. For example, for an image classification problem, the queries could be portions of the image, or relate to aspects of an object, such as its color, while in a medical diagnosis task the queries might be the results of various medical tasks or the presence/absence of symptoms. In experiments, this model outperforms other interpretable models on every task tested, with accuracy is nearly comparable to state-of-the-art non-interpretable models. Thus, this model demonstrates suitable performance and transparency for real-world use. The core concepts of the approach have been developed along with an algorithm for efficient computation.

The treatment of many cancers relies on the delivery of drugs (small molecules, peptides, and other biological molecules) to destroy the cancer (chemotherapy). While many chemotherapies have been highly successful at destroying the tumor, the effectiveness is limited by off target side effects and lack of bioavailability and distribution (see Lorscheider, M. et al 2021). A major improvement to decreasing off target interactions of the drug is by making drug delivery systems specific to the cell type affected. Nanoparticle technology has been especially important in targeted delivery as they are small in size and the surface proteins can be manipulated to interact only with desired cells. However, nanoparticles (NPs) have not been successful at penetrating solid tumors and have the potential to activate the immune system (see Mitragotri, S. et al 2014 and Lorscheider, M. et al 2021). The ideal drug delivery system should be site-specific, avoid immune cell activation, and have a controlled release upon stimulation (see Bunggulawa et al. 2018). There is a need for delivery systems that can incorporate all of these requirements to effectively treat cancer without harmful side effects. The use of exosomes as a drug delivery can incorporate all of these requirements to effectively treat cancer without harmful side effects. However, the current state of exosome processing is limited and unreliable due to scalability challenges (see Lorscheider, M. et al 2021). There is a need to develop a method of producing exosomes at high quantities which would greatly increase their potential for drug delivery.\n\nTechnology Overview\nThe JHU technology enhances exosome production from a cell line that causes the overexpression of the exosomal protein CD63.

Convenient Delivery: Hydro(LNp) is a two-phase delivery system that increases effectiveness in regulating transplant rejection. Broad Scope: Has the potential to adapt for applications beyond transplantation, involving cancer, autoimmunity, and regenerative medicine. After end-stage organ diseases and other devastating tissue loss, transplantation becomes the only therapeutic option. However, transplanted patients need to receive high doses of multi-drug immunosuppressive therapy for the rest of their life to prevent rejection. This current standard often does more harm than good, with dangerous side effects including nephrotoxicity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and higher predisposition to infections and cancer. Therefore, there is an unmet need to identify a safer and effective treatment plan for transplant recipients. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) have identified that concomitant inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway (via small molecule inhibitors) and of a key costimulatory pathway (via the biologic CTLA4-Ig) improves the control of the immune response to a transplant. When these two methods come together, they create \u201cEnhanced Costimulation Blockade (ECoB), generating positive results without many rejection episodes or side effects. Joining forces with researchers at the National Institute of Health (NIH) and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (JH-APL), the multidisciplinary team engineered a dual component delivery system called Hydro(LNp), which delivers JAK inhibitors (JAKi) in a dual form: microcrystalline drug deposits in the hydrogel and lipid nanoparticles encapsulated drug. This product can be injected near the transplant site and the microcrystalline drug is released locally, while the LNp carry it to the specific distal sites where the immune response against the transplant is initiated.

This methodology can be completed at room-temperature, making this a thermally favorable synthesis. The poly(trans-SiCH) produced has a smaller spring constant compared to popular analogues, suggesting that this material could improve the properties of the bulk polymer network. The organosilicon described can be produced at room temperature, making it a less energy intensive material to create and manipulate. The incorporation of silicon into the material backbone supports strand elasticity and material robustness for use in energy and electronics materials. Silicon-based polymers, used in semiconductors and other electronics, are important for the future of creating flexible and large-area electronics. These polymers are not easy to manufacture, however, and current electronics use a variety of thermally-intensive technologies to create silicon wafers and electronics. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop manufacturing methods for organosilicon polymers that address the need for silicon polymer synthesis in a thermally-stable and flexible fashion. This technology has been validated and analyzed benchtop at lab scale.",

Unmet Need Capillary malformations, including port-wine birthmarks, occur in about 1 in 300 live births, while Sturge-Weber syndrome, a vascular malformation syndrome involving the brain, skin, and eye, occurs in about 1 in 20,000 live births. Current treatments are primarily symptomatic and inadequate. These conditions, caused by the R183Q somatic mosaic mutation in GNAQ in endothelial cells, lack effective targeted therapies. There is an unmet need for innovative treatments that specifically address the molecular abnormalities underlying these vascular malformations. Technology Overview Johns Hopkins researchers identified that endothelial cells with the GNAQ mutation exhibit increased sensitivity to the antibiotic puromycin. This discovery suggests a novel therapeutic approach using puromycin, its analogues, or its inhibitors to target these mutated cells. Researchers have found that puromycin treatment leads to abnormal TRPC6/NFAT signaling pathway in human embryonic kidney and human endothelial cells transfected with GNAQ mutations. Data from these cells treated with puromycin show reduced proliferation and decreased cell survival, indicating that puromycin antibiotic treatment maybe a viable therapeutic strategy of patients with GNAQ mutations and capillary malformations.",

Bead-based single-cell sequencing uses targeting sequences to capture mRNA molecules with individual molecular identifiers for each sequence. While these methods capture a large portion of RNA in each cell, they randomly collect each sequence based on binding of the 3\u2019 polyA tail on each strand of mRNA.

Currently, most synthetic catalysis is carried out via metals, enzymes, or organocatalysts. However, many of these catalysts suffer from poor separation, recovery, and recycling after use (see Jones). Additionally, they can have limited surface area for substrate interaction. Metal-organic frameworks have the potential to overcome these limitations because their porosity creates a large surface area and allows rapid diffusion of substrate molecules, and their crystalline structure enables characterization and separation from reactions (see Yoon). Metal-organic frameworks can also be post-synthetically modified to introduce additional functionalities (see Cohen). A remaining limitation for many metal-organic frameworks is their instability over time, as they tend to degrade during reaction or regeneration (see Jasuja). Increasing the stability of metal-organic frameworks through synthesis or post-synthetic modification could create longer-lasting, high surface area, asymmetric catalysts. Therefore, there is a need for creation of metal-organic frameworks that can act as asymmetric catalysts while maintaining structure and function through several rounds of catalysis. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a metal-organic framework that is post-synthetically modified and used as an asymmetric heterogenous catalyst for Michael additions and Diels-Alder reactions. The developed framework also displays enhanced stability over time. Successful asymmetric catalysis has been demonstrated.",

    "ip_description": "Mechanical ventilation is used to maintain adequate gas exchange and requires clinicians to manually adjust settings based on the patient\u2019s physiologic variables, which is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. With the shift to automated mechanical ventilators, predominantly due to their ability to automatically change the ventilation parameters in order to maintain the patient\u2019s physiological parameters at a certain control target, manufacturers have moved towards implementing novel algorithms, not only to distinguish themselves, but to provide new ventilation modes that can better control and manage the mechanical ventilation. However, in some marketed products, it was found that the algorithm would autonomously switch modes in response to unexpected stimuli, without providing information to the clinician, which can be fatal. Thus, although automation has the potential to decrease workload while maintaining an effective method of maintaining a mechanical ventilator\u2019s parameters, there currently lacks a method of increasing the reliability and robustness of these algorithms to unexpected signal inputs in order to create trust in these computer algorithms. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed an autonomous mechanical ventilation system that incorporates assurance, which is the state of being clear-headed either that a hypothesis or prediction is correct or that a chosen course of action is the best or most effective, with the goal of increasing the reliability of autonomous ventilation algorithms. The system alerts a clinician when there is a potentially clinically relevant difference between the current state and target, and the addition of assuredness in the system architecture of an autonomous mechanical ventilation algorithm has the potential to significantly improve the reliability and trust in these systems for clinical use.",

    "published_date": "8/16/2024",
    "ip_description": "Chromosomal aberrations like aneuploidies affect one in 150 pregnancies worldwide and are responsible for half of early pregnancy terminations (1). Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT-A) can screen for embryos with de novo aneuploidies such as subchromosomal deletions/additions (2). PGT-A can only be performed on embryos generated via in vitro fertilization (IVF) and can be used to select for embryos with intact chromosomes, improving the odds of viable conception and pregnancy. Other forms of pre-implantation genetic testing involve invasive procedures such as blastocyst biopsies (3). Other types of prenatal tests for aneuploidy include karyotyping (4), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (5), quantitative PCR of short tandem repeats (6), and comparative genomic hybridization (7). These prenatal tests may be done after implantation (like karyotyping) or in in situ fertilization patients (FISH). PGT-A falls short in terms of distinguishing between aneuploidies of mitotic and meiotic origin. Meiotic aneuploidies affect all of the progeny cells, with the most common type of trisomies representing about 35% of spontaneous abortions (8). Mitotic aneuploidies result in chromosomal mosaicism, which may lead to serious birth defects (9), depending on certain factors such as the types of cells and tissues in which the aneuploidies are expressed. However, some mitotic aneuploidies can be compatible with healthy live births (10). Therefore, there is a strong need for improvements in PGT-A screens to better distinguish the cellular origins of aneuploidies and aid in selection of embryos for transfer in IVF. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a new method of assessing PGT-A data from IVF patients to distinguish the meiotic versus mitotic origins of aneuploidies. Comparative analyses of chromosomal copies and abnormalities are employed to search for certain signatures and motifs that are associated with mitotic vs meiotic origins of aneuploidies. Statistical models are also used to better distinguish results that could have arisen by chance, further boosting the confidence and fidelity of the test.",

There are an estimated 357,900 adult and 19,900 pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests with the number of adult cases increasing year over year from 2008 to 2017. Currently, CPR efficacy is less than 40% of the American Heart Association standards even with the addition of feedback devices.\n\nOverall, it is exceptionally difficult (if not impossible) for a code team leader to simultaneously focus on high quality CPR, early defibrillation, ALS algorithms and identification of reversible causes of arrest. One of these foci is inevitably compromised, leading to a failure to reach AHA standards. There is a great need for a way to ensure the highest quality of CPR can be continually administered in the life-threatening situations that require it.\n\nA researcher at Johns Hopkins developed an improved team-based CPR delivery system aimed at integrating a CPR Coach within the resuscitation team to increase the overall quality and compression depth of CPR. To maximize resource effectiveness through division of labor, the CPR Coach was instructed to focus on directing high quality CPR while the code team leader focused on the higher level problem solving of managing the patient according to the appropriate PALS algorithm and diagnosing reversible causes. The CPR coach can cognitively unload the code team leader so that instead of spending mental energy on monitoring quality, they can effectively run through H\u2019s and T\u2019s earlier in the resuscitation.\n\nThe team has created training material to help hospitals include this role and train the CPR Coach, which has yielded positive results in practice, increasing CPR quality and depth.

An independent replication in peripheral blood DNA from individuals from the GenRED offspring cohort also exhibited significance at both DNA methylation and genotype model terms.

The subject of invention being reported here is a chemical agent that kills M. tuberculosis and prevents growth of Gram-positive bacteria. These specific agents are not known in the current state of art. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from long-term and widespread use of antibiotics has become a growing concern in the current clinical climate and is projected to be the number one killer by 2050. The WHO has declared AMR among the 10 worldwide public health threats facing humanity. Currently, medicinal chemists have focused their efforts on identifying new targets to develop drugs possessing novel structures with unique mechanisms of actions. The oxazolidinone class of antibiotics could effectively kill multidrug resistant Gram-positive bacteria; in fact, the clinical first-line drug linezolid (marketed as Zyvox) is currently indicated for various bacterial infections, has shown excellent antibacterial activity and is widely used to treat bacterial infections. Nonetheless, antibacterial resistance and adverse hematological and myelotoxic effects have been clinically observed with linezolid. Therefore, newer oxazolidinones that are safer without sacrificing antibacterial potency can be of very high utility in treating bacterial diseases.",

    "ip_description": "Neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) is expressed in neurons and hydrolyzes sphingomyelin, producing the lipid ceramide, which functions in stress responses leading to apoptosis, cell growth arrest, and differentiation. Increased levels of ceramides have been associated with many neurological disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and ALS. Although nSMase2 remains an attractive target for therapeutics for these diseases, currently available nSMase2 inhibitors are metabolically unstable and exhibit low potency in vivo. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed novel small molecules that strongly inhibit nSMase2. First, the researchers identified key moieties required for nSMase2 inhibition by 2,6-dimethoxy-4-[4-phenyl-5-(2-thienyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl] phenol (DPTIP). The inventors then synthesized molecular derivatives that varied at these key moieties and evaluated their potency as nSMase2 inhibitors. The invention is in the discovery phase. Inventors have synthesized novel small molecule nSMase2 inhibitors, and evaluated the in vitro inhibitory potencies of these compounds using human nSMase2 assays. Selected compounds underwent in vitro metabolic stability studies in mouse and human liver microsomes before being used in in vivo pharmacokinetics studies in a mouse model.",

    "ip_description": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that negatively impacts the immune system, leading to immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to secondary, opportunistic infections and some cancers. It is estimated that 36.7 million people worldwide are currently living with HIV. Presently, HIV has no cure and requires life-long treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) to maintain a low viral load and prevent or delay progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). ART is generally comprised of three drugs targeting various stages of the viral life cycle. However, HIV can evolve resistance to one or more of these drugs. Consequently, there remains a great need for new drugs to target the virus. Johns Hopkins researchers have discovered an inhibitor for Neutral Sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) that can be utilized as a novel therapeutic for HIV. This inhibitor interferes with viral assembly and budding from the cellular membrane, which are critical parts of the HIV life cycle and maturation process. The inhibitor demonstrated dose dependent reduction of HIV replication in vitro and also significantly reduced viral load in HIV-infected, humanized mice. The inventors have discovered the first HIV viral budding inhibitor that could be used as a novel component of antiretroviral therapy. Further studies will be conducted to determine its efficacy in human patients and its success in conjunction with other antiretroviral drugs already in use.",

    "ip_description": "In the brain, neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) is expressed in neurons and increased activity and expression of this enzyme has been associated with pro-inflammatory conditions observed in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) patients. Inhibition of human nSMase2 may preserve neuronal function by preventing increases in ceramide, and/or blocking exosome production and as a consequence decreasing cell death. A number of nSMase inhibitors have been identified, but these compounds have molecular characteristics that make them poor drug candidates including a lack of specificity, low potency, and undesirable physicochemical properties that reduce drug-likeness and blood brain barrier penetration. However, there are no soluble, specific and potent small molecule inhibitor tool compounds for in vivo studies or as a starting point for medicinal chemistry optimization. JHU researchers developed and optimized two activity assays using a recombinant human nSmase2 protein to identify more drug-like nSMase2 inhibitors. Their research identified Cambinol and eight cambinol analogues. Cambinol is a novel uncompetitive inhibitor of human nSMase2 and when compared to GW4869, the most extensively used prototype, it has similar potency but exhibits significantly higher aqueous solubility and lower molecular weight (MW). When compared to inhibitors with similar MW (e.g. altenusin, C11AG or macquarimicin A), cambinol is a more potent inhibitor. Cambinol\u2019s mode of inhibition and the lack of time-dependence of its IC50 value indicate that cambinol does not bind to the substrate binding site of the enzyme but rather to an alternative site blocking activity and it does so reversibly. Furthermore, in vivo studies revealed cambinol decreased ceramide levels and protected neurons from cell death and dendritic damage. Pharmacologically active compounds and approved drugs were screened using this strategy which led to the identification of cambinol as a novel uncompetitive nSMase2 inhibitor (Ki = 7 \u03bcM). The inhibitory activity of cambinol for nSMase2 was approximately 10-fold more potent than for its previously known target. Cambinol decreased tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 or interleukin-1 \u03b2-induced increases of ceramide and cell death in primary neurons. A preliminary study of cambinol structure and activity allowed the identification of the main structural features required for nSMase2 inhibition. Cambinol and its analogs may be useful as nSMase2 inhibitor tool compounds to prevent ceramide-dependent neurodegeneration.",

Briefly, researchers created a FRET-compatible barcoding library of FPs and calibration standards capable of normalizing signals across various imaging settings. Cells expressing biosensors are separately labeled with barcoded proteins, and imaged for spatiotemporal molecular profiling. Multiplexed biosensor imaging can facilitate comprehensive identification and kinetic characterization of multiple cellular activities.

Approximately 1.24 million hematological cancer cases occur each year, accounting for approximately 6% of all cancer cases (Bristol Myers Squibb). Currently, standard treatment strategies include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplants. However, there exist several major drawbacks for each method.

Use of small molecule modulators against the identified target have resolved many patient symptom complaints. Dysautonomia is a disease of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) with heterogenous etiology and presentation. Patient heterogeneity makes diagnosis and treatment of dysautonomias challenging. While familial dysautonomia (FD) is a rare genetic disorder, the genetic and epigenetic basis of dysautonomia is unknown for the majority of patients. Currently, patients with dysautonomia are evaluated and diagnosed based on clinical history, timeline, and neurological examination. Diagnosis informs treatment; however, treatment is often limited to lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions that are limited in scope. Therefore, there is a strong need for a better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic basis of dysautonomia to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic options for this broad patient population. Pre-clinical studies have been completed. In vitro models incorporating target mutations have been developed. Validated animal models of autonomic dysfunction have been developed.

    "ip_description": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are infections in any part of the urinary system (e.g., kidney, ureter, bladder, urethra, etc.). They are the most common outpatient infections, with over 7 million patient visits per year, 50-60% of which occur in adult women. UTIs are generally diagnosed via urinalysis which can be used to detect changes in urine chemistries or inflammation and may include urine culture to identify pathogens. Testing can be completed in a laboratory or at the point-of-care (using dipsticks). However, the sensitivity and specificity of point-of-care tests can vary, limiting the diagnostic accuracy of these tests. The current gold standard for diagnosing UTIs is through urine culture, which can be used to specifically identify the pathogen responsible for infection. However, this process can be lengthy and expensive, and only provides a single snapshot from the time of urine collection. This type of analysis also depends on the sporadic collection of urine, which has the potential to miss key events between time points. Thus, there is a need for a low-cost and real-time method of analyzing urine in order to improve the treatment and management of UTIs. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a low-cost device that can image urine draining through a catheter using lensless digital holography, and these data can be used to identify patients with UTIs. Not only is this a non-invasive alternative to traditional urine culture, it is also continuous and real-time, which permits the analysis of temporal trends. The inventors have developed prototypes that verify this approach through the comparison of particle concentration estimates in flowing human urine with ground-truth results. This is the first technology that enables microscopic analysis of urine at the bedside, which has the potential to introduce automated analyses of excreted urine over time to the clinical workflow.",

There is great interest in further understanding the molecular mechanisms governing CaMKII signaling and in finding potential CaMKII inhibitors with therapeutic applications. Both of these goals have been hindered by the lack of tools for measuring CaMKII activity with precise temporal and subcellular resolution in living cells. Therefore, there is a strong need for the development of novel bioassays to assess CamKII activity. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor (CaMKAR) that reports CaMKII activity in living cells and in vitro. The CamKAR biosensor sensitively reports CaMKII activity and has vastly superior dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio, and activation kinetics when compared to existing sensors. CamKAR measures bona fide, direct CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation and does not cause CaMKII overexpression.

    "ip_description": "Machine learning systems are becoming increasingly used in various industries, from banking, healthcare, to government and retail. These systems use large amounts of data to train models that can automatically make predictions based on past trends. For example, it can be used to detect fraud, diagnose cancer, or to detect ransomware attacks. Due to the widespread application of machine learning systems, these models are often shared and made publicly available to an extent. For example, there are many trained models that are made publicly available, such that anyone can download it and make queries, or predictions, without accessing the model parameters. However, recent literature shows that machine learning can be used for membership inference, which is classifying and determining whether a data instance was part of the training dataset or not. This is a significant privacy concern because some models are trained on sensitive data, such as patient health records. To address this potential privacy breach, membership inference attack models are designed to test how robust a machine learning model truly is, and defense mechanisms are developed to increase the robustness of a model against these attacks. However, the state-of-the-art attack models that are most effective rely on shadow models, which are models that closely resemble the target model, and are used to generate training data. This is highly unrealistic because most publicly available machine learning models only provide black box access, only enabling queries. State-of-the-art defense models compromise model accuracy and are ineffective for attacks with white box access to the model parameters, since the methods rely on perturbing the training process or output vectors. Thus, there is a need for a robust and effective method of modeling a membership inference attack and of defending against these attacks executed by any type of adversary. Johns Hopkins researchers invented a novel method of modeling membership inference attacks, and a robust defense approach that preserves the target model\u2019s accuracy. The attack model, BlindMI, probes the target model to extract membership information using a novel approach called differential comparison. It was demonstrated in a publication that BlindMI outperforms state-of-the-art attacks in terms of the F1 score, and even achieves reasonable F1 scores against models with defenses, like adversarial regularization, MemGuard, and differential privacy. The novel defense method is based on perturbing the input data instance. Adversaries with white box access to the target model parameters cannot generate accurate predictions without knowledge of this secret perturbation, thus preventing the model from successful MI attacks. It was demonstrated to be the only defense to reduce the accuracy of a MI attack while preserving the test accuracy of the target model.",

    "ip_description": "There is a growing number of aging Americans living with multiple morbidities, which has placed immense financial burden on healthcare programs across the country (CMS, 2012). Under the current model, older adult patients seek general medical care from their primary care physician (PCP), and additionally visit specialists for specific chronic health conditions. In this care model, PCPs are overwhelmed with the responsibility of not only providing the best care but also coordinating care between various specialists. A simple mistake in this care coordination can have severe consequences (Wiley-Blackwell, 2011). Moreover, as patients grow frailer, they have more difficulty following physician recommendations, leading to complications, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits, further driving up healthcare costs (Hostetter, 2016) Having a dedicated, trained health professional to assist physicians in the care coordination of older patients with multiple comorbidities can greatly improve health outcomes and reduce spending. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop new health care models to address these issues. Johns Hopkins researchers previously created the Guided Care model to better manage care for the growing number of aging American with multiple chronic conditions. This model involves training a registered nurse to work with a physician on the coordination of care. The nurse performs a standardized comprehensive home assessment and then collaborates with the physician, patient, and caregiver to generate management plans. Researchers have now developed four standardized forms that can be utilized to better facilitate patient care under the Guided Care model: 1) Health History (structures collection of specific clinical data from medical records, patients, and caregiver), 2) Preliminary Care Guide (working document by the nurse and physician that includes the patient\u2019s health-related priorities, nurse\u2019s assessment of the patient\u2019s needs, and immediate actions to be taken), 3) Care Guide (succinct summary of the patient\u2019s clinical status and plan of care), and 4) Action Plan (patient-friendly document that summarizes the self-management actions that the patient has agreed to complete). These forms allow the healthcare team and patient to prioritize their health needs and set goals. By improving patient collaboration and care coordination, incorporating standardized forms into the Guided Care model can broadly improve healthcare outcomes and reduce costs.",

The management of cardiovascular diseases depends on the specific indication, and standard therapies include one or multiple of the following types of medications: blood thinners, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel-blockers, and cholesterol-lowering medications (see Everyday Health). Despite the availability of these various drugs, nearly 18 million people still die as a result of cardiovascular diseases each year, accounting for about 32% of deaths worldwide (see WHO). Development of innovative therapies with novel mechanisms of action could expand the number of available medications for management of cardiovascular diseases and help prevent some of these deaths.\n\nOne such novel mechanism is the recently discovered physiological roles of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Naturally occurring H2S helps reduce oxidative stress in the body, and it plays roles in the relaxation of blood vessels, reduction of atherosclerotic plaque formation, and creation of new blood vessels, all of which are protective against cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, H2S helps protect the body from neurodegenerative disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and cancer (see Wallace). Some molecules are being studied for their therapeutic potential as H2S donors, however their H2S release rates can be difficult to control, thereby limiting therapeutic relevance (see Zaorska). As an alternative to direct H2S release, future drugs could act through creation of hydropersulfides, the known mechanism of H2S action in the body (see Filipovic). As such, there is a strong need for development of drugs that can create hydropersulfides and therefore be used as therapeutics for cardiovascular and other diseases.\n\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a class of molecules that act as hydropersulfide precursors. They have demonstrated that alteration of different side chains can finely tune the kinetics of hydropersulfide formation, causing faster or slower molecular action. This tunability could potentially be translated into therapeutic duration, thus enabling physiologically relevant treatment of disease.\n\nThe developed molecules have shown to increase hydropersulfide levels, as well as protect against oxidative stress in cardiac cells.

Although they have long been essential components of research experiments and diagnostic assays, their use as therapeutics is revolutionizing the treatment of many autoimmune and cancerous conditions. The antibody drug market is estimated at $126.7 billion (BCC Research) and the antibody testing market is valued at $7.4 billion (Persistence Market Research). Antibodies\u2019 enormous specificity for their target is responsible for a large portion of their value, but makes discovering and refining them for a specific task expensive. The custom antibody market is valued at $393 million (Markets and Markets). Antibodies suitable for a desired task are currently identified through experimental antibody screens that involve antigen identification, purification methods, usage of a living organism for development and collection of antibodies, and refinement to improve certain properties. The cost of this process depends on the specific antibody but is typically in the thousands of USD range at the least. The main limitation of this process is the expense and time involved in this labor-intensive process. Solutions that address the above limitations are likely computational in nature. Therefore, there is a strong need for a rapid, inexpensive, likely computational solution to be developed to simplify the difficulties in identifying promising antibodies. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a machine learning method to identify promising antibody candidates from datasets of antibody sequences, and provides suggestions for which parts of the antibody may be involved in binding to the target. The researchers developed a model based on BERT, a popular language model, and trained it on 558 million antibody sequences. They used a multiple instance learning framework to predict whether a set of antibody sequences is likely to contain a subsequence of amino acids involved in binding to the target. Further benefits of this method, in addition to its enormous time and expense-saving capabilities, include its easy potential for improvement and personalization. An improved model architecture or training dataset could be easily integrated. For personalized antibody treatments, the model could be further trained on an individual patient\u2019s antibody sequences.

In addition, automated reports produce text-structured information that would, in future, reduce the challenges of natural language processing (NLP) and other artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medical analysis. In addition to the stroke volume, other clinically relevant indices for acute treatment are extracted from brain images. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a visual evaluation system to assess the extent and location of ischemic core in patients with acute strokes. Due to its relative simplicity of assessment, ASPECTS gained popularity and was also adapted to diffusion weighted MRIs.

The 3D motion capture market has an estimated size of $151.8 million (Verified Market Research). In state-of-the-art systems, motion tracking is either done optically or electromagnetically (EM). EM trackers are inaccurate in environments containing ferromagnetic materials or when the markers are far from the sensor, and require connected (wired) markers. Optical trackers only require that the passive markers are in direct line of sight of the camera(s), which makes them the preferred tracking method in most applications. Currently, there are two predominant options for conducting marker-based optical tracking: multi-camera systems with point like markers and single camera systems with structured markers. Multi-camera systems are capable of tracking the position of small spherical markers from a wide range of fields-of-view at high precision but require an expensive array of sensors, specialized hardware and complicated setup and calibration. Orientation information can be inferred from the 3D positions of multiple tracked markers. Such systems are used in most human motion capture applications. Existing single camera systems track larger markers that feature sub-structures (e.g. QR tags) to enable the calculation of 3D orientation from a single camera view. These provide precise measurement only at limited range of orientations and positions; therefore they are not suitable for most applications where the targets can move around in freedom in the environment. Such single camera systems are often used in industrial applications where the line-of-sight and view angles are predictable or well controlled. Surgical tracking system typically use multiple cameras and structured markers in order to prevent line-of-sight occlusions and to extend the range of detectable orientations. Animal tracking is a special application space where the targets (animals) tend to move around in a way that necessitates the ability to track a wide range of orientations. In current practice it means that most 3D animal trackers use expensive and complicated multi-camera setups. Currently there are only two sections of the market that are well served by existing technologies: expensive and complicated multi-camera systems, and cheap systems with limited accuracy and functionality. There is a strong need for a solution that works on cheap hardware that is simple to set up, yet capable of providing precise measurements over a wide range of orientations and positions. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a system combining hardware that can be commonly found in behavioral laboratories (a single camera, a ring light mounted on the camera, and a computer) with a specially-designed 3D marker to be placed on the animal and a computer vision algorithm that can process the camera images and generate the animal\u2019s 3D position and orientation in each frame. The system has an accuracy comparable to a popular commercial system and a wider range of angles than a popular open-source system. In addition to the commercial-level accuracy accomplished at very little cost, this invention\u2019s generalizability is also compelling. The system can be adapted for use on bigger animals (which would require a larger marker and different camera) and objects such as drones. The invention could even be applied to multiple targets simultaneously, which could enable analysis of interactions. A prototype of this invention has been built and used in laboratories.",

    "ip_description": "Currently, 55% of the world\u2019s population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to grow to 68% by 2050 (United Nations, 2018). The increasing growth of urban population will put heavy stress on existing infrastructure such as the transportation system. Outdated traffic signal timing accounts for more than 10% of all traffic delay and congestion on major routes alone (US Department of Transportation, 2017). Implementing \u201csmart traffic controllers\u201d using artificial intelligence has the potential to alleviate the existing and future issues regarding traffic in major cities. However, artificial intelligence is vulnerable to edge failure cases that can have both performance and safety ramifications (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2014). Therefore, there is a strong need for artificial intelligence systems that can be reliably monitored and adjusted to ensure safe and effective control. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a system for monitoring artificial intelligence (AI) controller performance that can change control policies if the controller is in danger of failure. By monitoring the confidence of the AI controller, the Runtime Assurance of Distributed Intelligent Control Systems (RADICS) approach is capable of quickly switching away from the AI controller to a safer control policy. Once the potential crisis has been averted, RADICS gives control back to the AI controller for an overall improvement in performance without sacrificing safety during failure cases. The invention has been evaluated in a popular Traffic Light controller framework (Simulation of Urban Mobility) and proven to be more effective at handling failure cases than current AI solutions.",

    "ip_description": "Epilepsy is a devastating disease that affects over 50 million people globally. 70% of patients diagnosed with epilepsy can treat their symptoms with medication, but around 30% of patients have symptoms that do not respond to drugs. Recent studies have found that the most effective treatments for drug resistant epilepsy are interventions that surgically remove or electrically interrupt seizure initiation in the epileptogenic zone (EZ). The EZ refers to the network of regions in the brain from which seizure activity is triggered. However, due to lack of information and proper understanding of the anatomical extent of the EZ, surgical success rates of these interventions are quite low, varying from 30%-70%. Given that total diagnostic and surgical treatment costs are at least $200,000 per patient, these low success rates create a significant clinical and economic burden, and many surgical candidates opt out of this potentially curative procedure. Thus, there is need for a method that can provide better localization and guidance of the EZ zone for increased surgery success rates. Johns Hopkins inventors have created a computational algorithm that utilizes invasive EEG (iEEG) recordings to identify the seizure onset zone in focal epilepsy patients. The algorithm utilizes dynamic network models (DNMs) to leverage iEEG data for each patient to localize the EZ. DNMs are estimated from interictal (between seizure) data which will significantly decrease the required invasive monitoring time, as current clinical practice relies predominantly on data captured during seizure events. The properties derived from each DNM that have correlation to the EZ are then developed, validated, and benchmarked against state-of-the-art algorithms on a large population of drug resistant epilepsy patients. This tool has the potential to facilitate more accurate localization of the seizure onset zone by providing new information from largely ignored interictal data, while minimizing patient risk factors and hospital costs by decreasing required monitoring time.",

    "ip_description": "Every year, around 5 million people are diagnosed with epilepsy globally. About 30% of the global epileptic population have medically refractory epilepsy (MRE) with seizures that cannot be controlled with medication. MRE patients have two treatment options: surgical resection of or electrical stimulation of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Both treatments can be lifesaving but rely on accurate identification of the SOZ. With current techniques of identification, patients must undergo prolonged hospital stays for observation of seizures, and clinicians generally have to visually inspect, channel by channel, hours of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data looking for abnormalities that indicate epileptogenicity. These techniques are subjective and time consuming, and still result in poor surgical outcomes, in which the success rates of these treatments are still only 50% because of inaccurate SOZ localization. Thus, there is a need for a method that can efficiently and accurately localize the SOZ to improve patient surgical outcomes. The inventors have created patient-specific dynamical network models (DNMs) that can be used to characterize the dynamics of the brain network activity and provide quantitative metrics to be used in precisely localizing the SOZ. The network models are built from the evoked responses of patients that have undergone evaluation with single-pulse electrical stimulation. The DNMs are linear, time-invariant (LTI) state-space and single input multioutput transfer function models. Using properties of DNMs such as reachability and system gain, the models can accurately replicate the neural evoked responses within each patient and identify the SOZ, early spread, and irritative zones with greater accuracy than the time consuming, subjective localization techniques. This product, in the future, will be developed into a software tool that aids clinicians in identifying the SOZ. The clinicians will be able to upload the patients iEEG data and the software can process and analyze the data through the creation of DNM models. This technology will give clinicians greater insight into the network dynamics of a patient\u2019s epilepsy, enabling a more precise surgical resection and ultimately improve surgical outcomes. The models have been created and are undergoing further verification and validation testing.",

This can affect the accuracy and usability of AR applications, such as surgical guidance, architectural design, and manufacturing.\n\nJHU Solution: The inventors have developed a novel calibration technique that allows the user to align a real-world object with a virtual object from multiple viewpoints simultaneously, using reflective AR displays that simulate mirror-like views. The user can adjust the position of the real-world object until it matches the virtual object from different angles, and the system can store the calibration definitions for future use. The system can also generate the virtual object based on the images or video of the real-world object captured from different viewpoints.\n\nValue Proposition: The proposed technique can improve the alignment accuracy and stability of AR applications, by taking into account the user\u2019s viewing angle and the spatial relationship between the real-world object and the virtual object. The technique can also reduce the calibration time and effort, by allowing the user to align the objects from multiple viewpoints at once, rather than sequentially.

    "ip_description": "Over 2 million joint replacement surgeries are done per year in the United States. However, the biomechanic functionality of joint implants is often limited because of the large discrepancies between the native bone of the patient and the material and structural properties of the metallic implants. In addition to the material of the implant being greatly different from actual bone, each and every patient has unique bone properties, which can affect the way that an implant fits a patient\u2019s body. In current medical practice, joint implants have standardized sizes, and there exists a belief that all implants will behave the same in every body. However, because of this over-standardization, there are significant limitations in geometry, material, and structural properties of these implants. Additionally, there are major limitations in the design of traditional implants which can limit their use in a variety of surgical applications. Thus, a way to create customized, proper structural models for joint replacements is needed. Johns Hopkins inventors have created a new approach to design structures for joint replacement surgeries. They are utilizing computer aided methods to generate structural models from CT scans for individual patients\u2019 bones in a semi-automated fashion. They are coupling this method with topology optimization, which utilizes mathematical sensitivity information as the main driver for improving performance. Using this method, the inventors have been able to design implants such that the material layout within the defined implant geometry is based on regional demands rather than standardized sizes and material. Thus, the entire structure of the implant design can be optimized to satisfy a variety of design goals and to generate the most structurally optimal implants that are mechanically feasible. The inventors have also been able to modulate implant stiffness throughout the domain to most optimally interact with patients\u2019 local bone material properties, and to minimize adverse stress/strain distributions within the bone. Additionally, the outputs of this design method interface seamlessly with automated or additive manufacturing methods, such as 3D printing. As a result, the implants can be composed of different commonly used orthopedic materials such as titanium, cobalt chrome, or different polymers. Using these methods, the inventors\u2019 technology enables the design to either be semi-hollow or fully trabecular, demonstrating a significant improvement of their implant over many commercially available implants. The inventors have currently employed their technique in a variety of total hip femoral implants and have built models for several different bone qualities. They will apply the same technology in future testing with total knee and ankle tibial implants.",

In order to properly study the disease and investigate potential treatments, a model is needed that accurately represents the disease state. Therefore, there is a strong need to generate a mouse model with the human specific mutation in the SYNGAP1 gene. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a mouse to model the human SYNGAP1 disease mutation. Using a CRISPR-Cas9 knockin strategy, researchers were able to generate a mouse line that has a SYNGAP1 exon 17 splice acceptor mutation known to contribute to the disease state. Interestingly, these mice recapitulate the hyperactivity and repetitive behavior observed in the patients with the same mutation. The mouse line provides a model to study the pathobiology of the SYNGAP1 mutation and test therapeutic candidates. Stage of Development: Mouse model is developed.",

Using a bleomycin mouse model of lung fibrosis, they have found that intrathecal injections of recombinant human PAD4 monoclonal antibodies dramatically reduced accumulation of lung fibrosis in-vivo. Clinical data from RA-UIP patients also show that serum anti-PAD4 antibody levels were associated with less lung fibrosis, better lung function, and decreased mortality. Mechanistic in-vitro studies suggest that PAD4 targets monocytes and promotes a pro-inflammatory phenotype and the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 which promotes the resolution of lung fibrosis.

    "ip_description": "Recent human genetic studies have suggested that mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene are linked to intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), neurodevelopmental disorders, high rates of epilepsy, and schizophrenia. SYNGAP1 is a gene that encodes SynGAP, a GTPase-activating protein that is highly enriched in nerve cells in the brain. SynGAP is found at the junctions between nerve cells, allowing for cell-to-cell communications to take place. The SYNGAP1 gene has 3 distinct transcriptional start sites and can be alternatively spliced to generate 4 distinct C-terminal isoforms, designated as \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b2, and \u03b3. Key pathophysiological symptoms of ID and ASD patients have been recapitulated in SYNGAP1 heterozygous (+/-) knockout mice, which exhibit epileptic circuit activity, altered synaptic transmission, and severe working memory deficits. These data suggest that SYNGAP1 haplo-insufficiency is likely pathogenic in the ID/ASD-associated SYNGAP1 cases; however, the contribution of each SYNGAP isoform to pathogenic SYNGAP1 haplo-insufficiency remains unclear to date. This missing information is critical for the development of gene therapies combating deficits of pathogenic haplo-insufficiency. Johns Hopkins researchers have examined which splice variants rescue cellular phenotypes in SYNGAP1 haplo-insufficiency in vitro, using rodent neuronal cultures. These experiments show that expression of full-length and certain isoforms of SYNGAP1 can rescue synaptic and neuronal deficits in disease model cells. This information will help with developing strategies for genetic replacement treatments of SYNGAP1 disorders. The researchers identified antisense oligo nucleotides (ASOs) that can increase the expression of certain isoforms or total SYNGAP1, thus potentially rescuing SYNGAP1 function. These ASOs are potential therapeutic agents for SYNGAP1 haplo-insufficiency seen in intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental disorders. The inventors have characterized the key isoforms of SYNGAP1 sufficient for synaptic function rescue in disease model neurons. They have completed screening of ASOs that increase the expression of certain isoforms or total SYNGAP1.",

    "ip_description": "U.S. soldiers routinely perform military patrols, clear strategic areas, and conduct sensitive site exploitation in and around unsecured structures. During these operations, troops are vulnerable to ambushes and hidden booby traps. The ability to discretely detect these threats enables our forces to neutralize them on favorable terms and conduct operations at will. In an effort to aid this issue, researchers and engineers in APL's Asymmetric Operations Sector are developing standoff centimeter-wave holographic imaging (C-WHIM) technology for producing live 3-D images of threat objects hidden by opaque barriers. C-WHIM is a prototype radio-frequency (RF) imaging system that presents operators with a live, intuitively understandable picture of hidden metal objects such as firearms, improvised explosive devices, suicide vests, and other threats. C-WHIM imaging creates 3-D spatially resolved maps of the electric field throughout large volumes of interest (length scales of meters to tens of meters) to visualize and locate objects that strongly scatter electromagnetic (EM) energy. We image the scene using EM waves with frequencies and power levels similar to normal Wi-Fi devices. These waves easily penetrate common building materials, thick clothing, vegetation, and dense haze and dust, and provide spatial resolution on the order of a few centimeters. This technology is unique in its ability to produce live 3-D images of threat objects, penetrate thick opaque barriers, and operate in large unstructured environments using harmless low-power non-ionizing radiation. Transmitter antennas illuminate the scene with harmless low-power energy (100 mW at 3 - 6 GHz), and an array of receiver antennas measures the EM waves that scatter from nearby objects. These measurements are combined with computational holographic techniques to reconstruct the electric field throughout the scene. Regions of highly concentrated EM energy indicate the presence of strongly scattering objects such as metals. Our prototype system scans the scene multiple times per second and displays live, intuitively understandable 3-D images that can be adapted for a wide range of visualization platforms. Concepts of operation include rapidly screening crowds at checkpoints, detecting booby traps prior to entering buildings, and detecting improvised explosive devices around/ahead of convoys or forward-patrol elements. The next steps for the project are to develop new system configurations that enable future concepts of operation. These include a portable, reconfigurable collection of antennas that could be quickly deployed to surveil areas of interest and a wireless swarm of antennas that could scan ahead of convoys (airborne, drone-mounted) or around groups of soldiers (body-worn).",

Key findings from researchers at Hopkins have identified a critical c-terminal isoform of SYNGAP1 essential for its role in synaptic plasticity, \u03b11. Increasing this isoform from the intact allele of SYNGAP1 may prove as a safe and efficient therapeutic strategy, but the mechanism of splicing is currently unknown. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have characterized an essential SYNGAP1 splice isoform and found that increasing this \u03b11 isoform can rescue synaptic plasticity deficits in disease model assays. The researchers have subsequently developed splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) that increase this crucial isoform of SYNGAP1 and thereby rescuing SYNGAP function. This strategy is designed to be an effective therapeutic for diseases resulting from SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency such as epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorders.",

Through three rounds of screening, researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a highly efficient AAV-mediated gene therapy for SRID. Recent discoveries by these researchers have uncovered SYNGAP1 minigenes that can rescue synaptic plasticity deficits in disease model neurons. By using these minigenes and optimizing the vector, the inventors can deliver functional SYNGAP1 isoforms to the mouse brain at levels exceeding endogenous expression.

    "ip_description": "Identification of a mutant peptide with strong inhibitory effect on nociceptor TRPA1, useful for the prevention and treatment of chronic and acute pain and itch. Dysregulation of ion channels is associated with various debilitating conditions, including chronic pain and itch. Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), an ion channel expressed primarily in pain sensing neurons, has gained increasing attention as the main nociceptor mediating neurogenic inflammatory responses. In this invention researchers have identified a cell-permeable mimic of a negative TRPA1 regulator that strongly inhibits TRPA1 activity only when TRPV1 is present which likely only occur in nociceptors in the dorsal root ganglia. Advantages include: Enables targeted alleviation of pain via administration of a cell-permeable TRPA1 inhibitor. Animal data using this small peptide show significantly decreased acute nocifensive behaviors. This peptide is a regulator of TRPA1-TRPV1 complex that presents only in pain-sensing neurons thereby limiting off target side effects. Broadly useful for the treatment of multiple conditions, including pain, itch, and asthma. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a cell-permeable peptide effectively inhibiting activity of the mechanical stress sensor TRPA1, presenting a novel therapeutic for acute and chronic pain and itch. TRPA1 are calcium channels located in primary sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which generate different types of somatosensation, including pain and itch. Here, inventors discovered a peptide that, when carrying a specific mutation, promotes strong inhibition of TRPA1 activity. Therefore, administration of effective amounts of this cell-permeable mutant peptide can serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for disorders related to TRPA1-mediated neuronal hyperexcitability.",

    "ip_description": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects over 5 million people in North America. AD leads to nerve cell death and tissue loss in the brain, shrinking the brain and affecting many of its functions. The global AD population is steadily growing by 3-5% annually, with no cure or effective treatment (BCC Research). Current pharmacological treatments include cholinesterase inhibitors (Cis) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists. While these therapies both work to mitigate symptoms, there are no marketed treatments to reverse or prevent the progression of the disease (Yiannopoulou et al.). With the immense and rapidly growing size of the affected AD population, there is a significant need for more effective treatments that work to change the course of the disease progression. Researchers from Johns Hopkins and University of North Texas Health Science Center have developed a sigma-1 receptor (S1R) ligand that has potential as a therapeutic for the treatment of age-associated cognitive disorders in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, including AD and other forms of dementia. During research studies, the compound was able to reverse certain cognitive deficits in mouse models in a BDNF-dependent manner. In addition to AD, the compound may also act as a therapeutic agent for other neurological disorders including Parkinson\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington\u2019s Disease. This compound\u2019s ability to reverse cognitive deficits indicates its potential as a novel therapeutic for the treatment of AD and other cognitive diseases. The researchers have completed in vitro and in vivo testing, including evaluation of metabolic stability, pharmacokinetics, and in vivo cognitive efficacy. They are currently testing the product in a genetic model of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.",

    "ip_description": "Melanin pigments show many unique physicochemical properties with several commercial potential. Specifically it has much academic and commercial potential in broadband optical absorption, efficient conversion of radiation into heat, hybrid ionic-electronic conductance, and high affinity to a wide range of metals and radionuclides. Within these applications, there is an understanding that melanin biopolymers shield against different types of ionizing radiation. This is extremely relevant to space exploration and radiation therapeutic applications. The medical radiation shielding market size is expected to be worth $1,330 million by 2021, and this does not include the emergent space economy. Therefore, there is a need for a melanin thermoplastic composite that is able to shield against different types of ionizing radiation effectively and consistently, as there is no current solution on the market. In addition, this composite needs to be compatible with thermoplastics with the heat tolerance of melanin, such as current commercially available thermoplastics like PLA, PET, PETG, and PE. The inventors have developed a composite material of melanin mixed with thermoplastic usable as a 3D printer filament. This melanin-based 3D printed filament will allow for the construction of numerous objects for diverse applications of radiation shielding, energy capture, and bioelectronics. This composite is a PLA-melanin composite that has the ability to shield ionizing radiation for several applications, ranging from diagnostic medicine to space exploration. In addition, results have shown this composite to shield against UV and visible light, while also continually promoting heat harvesting properties due to the melanin physiochemical properties. By fabricating the composite through 3D-printer filaments, this technology also has the potential to be cheap and easier to produce than other potentially more expensive alternatives. The inventors have developed a prototype and are working to implement a 3-D printing component. They are continuing to develop further thermoplastic composites.",

These disorders result from progressive degeneration of the structure, function, and network of neurons in the central nervous system that are unable to self-repair and regenerate, causing blindness, paralysis, and loss of various cognitive and sensory functions. Millions of people of worldwide are affected by neurodegenerative disorders, and in the United States, more than 5 million people are living with AD and at least 500,000 are living with PD. The risk for developing a neurodegenerative disorder increases with age, and is a result of a combination of both environmental and genetic factors. As overall life-span increases and the generation of aging Americans continues to grow, a greater number of people will be affected. At present, there are no cures for these disorders or ways to drastically slow disease progression. Consequently, there is a great need to develop novel approaches to treat and prevent a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders. Johns Hopkins researchers have determined that the amyloid-beta (Ab) and alpha-synuclein aggregates that arise in the neurons of those with AD and PD and promote A1 astrocyte formation and the release of neurotoxic cytokines also significantly induce the activity of a serine/threonine-protein kinase. When this kinase was inhibited by various small molecules neuroinflammation was reduced, Ab and alpha-synuclein aggregate activation and A1 astrocyte formation was blocked, and neurons were secured. In a PD mouse model with alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFFs), a known RIPK2 inhibitor significantly rescued PFFs induced pathologies. The inventors have identified a novel, potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders including AD and PD. Further research and development are required to generate a first in class, orally active targeted kinase inhibitor with disease modifying effects for various neurodegenerative pathologies in actual human patients.",

    "published_date": "3/5/2024",
    "ip_description": "Novel temporary implant can offer a durable treatment for male urethral stricture by converting a complex open reconstructive surgery into a simple procedure.\n\nUnmet Need\nUrethral stricture disease causes fibrotic narrowing of the urethra leading to incomplete voiding, frequent and painful urination, and high rates of urinary tract infection. Graft-based reconstruction (substitution urethroplasty) is the curative gold standard for urethral stricture due to its high efficacy (85-90%). Unfortunately, few urologists can offer this durable therapy due to its technical complexity. Minimally invasive endoscopic interventions to incise or dilate the stricture are simple, and commonly performed by general urologists (GU). While minimally invasive, these procedures are also minimally effective with a high failure rate (50-90% stricture recurrence). In spite of this, endoscopic procedures are commonly repeated, leading to progression rather than resolution of the condition. Approximately 1% of the 21 million males on Medicare seek treatment for urethral strictures annually. Urologists estimate that 1 in 5 men will develop a stricture in their lifetime, with more than 600K stricture treatments performed annually in the US. This is expected to increase with the improved longevity of our aging population. Urologists and patients alike are dissatisfied with the limited solutions for treating urethral stricture disease.\n\nTechnology Overview\nThis invention is a novel medical device capable of performing endoscopic urethral reconstruction (EUR). An opportunity exists to combine the efficacy of open substitution urethroplasty with the simplicity of minimally invasive access through EUR. Building on prior innovative EUR attempts in the 1990s, this device allows for simple, efficient, and secured placement of a tissue or a skin graft at the urethral stricture site to promote patency. The device procedure involves the following steps: 1. Stricture incision to prepare an engraftment site. 2. graft harvest and fixation to the delivery device. 3. Endoscopic device delivery and deployment. 4. follow-up device retrieval after engraftment. Key innovations in this technology include mitigation of tissue ischemia and graft/device migration, atraumatic graft delivery, active graft release, and office-based atraumatic device removal.\nThe procedure begins with a graft harvest (buccal mucosa or other suitable tissue) and stricture incision with a custom graft-bed preparation tool. The harvested graft is loaded onto the device and atraumatically delivered to the target site. Once positioned, the temporary implant is deployed and the delivery tool is retrieved from the urethra. Urine can be voided either through the device or an indwelling catheter. After a 7-10 day recovery period, the patient returns for device removal (no anesthesia is required). The graft is released, and the implant is retrieved from the graft site. The result is improved urethral caliber with durable resolution of urethral stricture symptoms.\n\nStage of Development\nThe research team successfully demonstrated device immobility and graft adherence in a naive large-animal model. Currently, experiments are underway to validate the technology and demonstrate safety and increased urethral patency in a stricture-induced large-animal model. Extensive benchtop testing and validation have been performed to characterize mechanical performance and bond strengths. Simulated use-case tests involving residents and fellow physicians are being performed to assess usability and human factors. As the device approaches design freeze, the team intends to develop a small-batch manufacturing plan within the next 6-9 months.

    "ip_description": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most frequent form of pancreatic cancer, with a survival rate of less than 10% at five years largely due to late-stage diagnosis. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, primarily due to metastatic disease. Although routine clinical imaging methods (CT/MRI) represent the current standard of care for at-risk individuals in pancreatic and lung cancer surveillance, the cost of imaging, the availability of imaging facilities, the risks associated with radiation or contrast agents, all represent potential obstacles in expanding the imaging-based approaches to meet the demands of population level screening for PDAC or lung cancer. There is an unmet need for a simple, convenient and cost-effective screening tool that can offer high sensitivity and specificity for detecting cancer at population levels. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel data-driven approach using a system of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to process high resolution 1H MR spectra of human plasma or serum samples to distinctively identify individuals with undetected cancer from those who are healthy or may have other confounding forms of pancreatic or lung diseases to avoid false detection which is also of paramount importance in cancer screening. Since the spectral features obtained from plasma or serum reflect intricate metabolic processes associated with cancer or other disease processes, the ANN system can be extensively and optimally trained to track and discriminate subtle changes in the features with high sensitivity and specificity. This is the first of its kind approach in that it solely relies on the spectral data to learn the distinguishing patterns in its entirety from the training samples, so that the approach can be well adapted to diverse population demographics for detecting PDAC or NSCLC. As an AI-enabled biofluid-based screening tool, the approach can be extended, with availability of samples, to other cancers where early detection may play a crucial role in long term survival and also to make use of other types of biofluids other than plasma or serum from which 1H MR spectra can be obtained. Proof of concept. The implementation and rigorous testing were performed for PDAC, and in a limited way for NSCLC pending acquisition of more samples for training.",

    "ip_description": "Neuromodulation is an alteration of nervous system activity caused by the deliberate delivery of an electrical or pharmaceutical agent to a target area. It has a plethora of applications including deep brain stimulation for Parkinson\u2019s disease and responsive neurostimulation for seizure disorders. It is also becoming increasingly common to use electrophysiological features as biofeedback in neuromodulation procedures in order to adjust the characteristics of the applied therapy. These closed-loop systems must record and stimulate simultaneously during neural activity, a challenging task due to the presence of persistent stimulation artifacts that distort the recorded signals. Thus, there is a need for a method of reducing the artifact in signals acquired during neuromodulation therapies in order to increase the effectiveness of neuromodulation systems. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed an adaptive artifact removal system for removing brain stimulation artifacts from the recording sites of target brain structures. The method allows for simultaneous stimulation and recording while removing transient stimulation artifacts to provide an accurate electrophysiological signal detection during stimulation. This method can be fully implemented on a system-on-chip (SoC) technology and added to existing neuromodulation systems, for online stimulus artifact removal or as a software package for offline stimulus artifact removal. Currently, the inventors have fully designed and implemented this method in their electrophysiology devices and are working on a dedicated processor application. This invention has the potential to increase the accuracy of electrophysiological signals acquired in various neuromodulation procedures, thus significantly improving the effectiveness of closed-loop neuromodulation systems.

    "ip_description": "Loeys-Dietz Syndrome (LDS) is a rare genetic connective tissue disorder that is characterized by a high risk for aneurysm and dissection throughout the arterial tree and phenotypically resembles Marfan Syndrome. Marfan Syndrome and related disorders, such as LDS, have an incidence of 1 in 3000 to 5000 individuals (see UpToDate). LDS is specifically caused by heterozygous missense mutations in either TGF receptor gene (TGFBR1 or TGFBR2). Current management of the disease includes frequent imaging surveillance, prophylactic surgical repair, and vascular management, including the use of blood pressure-lowering medication and exercise restrictions (see MacCarrick et. al). These interventions are targeted to managing the disease rather than treating the pathogenic mechanism of the mutation. Therefore, there is a high demand for preclinical model systems of LDS that would promote a better scientific understanding of the disease and lead to the development of more targeted therapies. Researchers at Johns Hopkins developed the first Loeys-Dietz Syndrome (LDS) mouse models. Two strains of mice were made to model the disease; JAX Stock # 024634 (Tgfbr2G357W/+) and JAX Stock # 036511 (Tgfbr1M318R/+). In both strains, heterozygous mice recapitulate classic and severe features of the LDS phenotype. Mice at 24 weeks of age have detectable elastic fiber formation in aortic roots, aortic wall shows progressive thickening with excessive collagen, and mice have a predisposition to early death (hemothorax or hemopericardium is observable in approximately 60% of deaths). These mice also develop skeletal manifestations associated with LDS, such as kyphosis and craniosynstosis. These features all together make the mouse models a valuable tool in studying LDS in a preclinical setting.",

    "ip_description": "Sarcopenia is the progressive loss of muscle mass and function, and is a natural part of the aging process. Age-related muscle loss and weakness can contribute to frailty and increase the likelihood of falls and fractures in older adults. Recent reports found that 5-13% of persons over the age of 65 years and >50% of people 80 years and older have sarcopenia (see Morley et.al). Currently the standard of care for patients with sarcopenia is in managing the condition. Patients are put on exercise regimens, nutritional supplementation plans, and some receive occupational therapy. These interventions improve quality of life but do not stop treat cellular and molecular mechanism leading to muscle loss (see UptoDate). To date, there are no approved drugs to treat age-related sarcopenia. Therefore, with today\u2019s sizable aging population, there is a significant need for therapeutics to treat sarcopenia. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a class of drugs that are able to target an important mechanism involved in the preservation of the neuromuscular junction and muscle function in models of disease as well as normal Aging. They have tested GCPII inhibitors in SOD ALS mice and well as aged wild-type mice and showed that treatment significantly improved muscle mass, strength and physiology in comparison to vehicle-treated controls. Drug treatment also improved overall mobility, decreased age-related pro inflammatory cytokines in the plasma, and strikingly increased lifespan of the aged mice. In summary, researchers have found a new utility of GCPII inhibition via targeted drugs, for the treatment of age-related sarcopenia as well as longevity enhancement.",

    "ip_description": "Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain. Excessive glutamate signaling can disrupt calcium homeostasis, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, and neuron loss via necrotic or apoptotic pathways. This phenomenon, known as excitotoxicity, contributes to disease pathogenesis in the settings of acute brain injury (i.e., stroke, trauma) and chronic neurodegenerative disease (i.e., ALS, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, schizophrenia). Therapeutic efforts to curb excitotoxicity include treatment with glutamate receptor antagonists (Memantine) or with drugs that inhibit presynaptic glutamate release (Lamotrigine). These approaches have had limited clinical success, in part due to side effects from the disruption of normal neurotransmission. Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) is a surface membrane protein that is responsible for the hydrolysis of N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) to release glutamate and N-acetylaspartate (NAA). GCPII inhibition directly reduces glutamate levels, while also increasing levels of NAAG, a glutamate receptor agonist whose activity prevents additional glutamate release and promotes the release of TGF\u03b2, leading to neuroprotection. The utility of GCPII inhibitors has been demonstrated in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases associated with excitotoxicity, but the blood-brain barrier remains an obstacle to clinical candidate development. Therefore, there is a strong need to identify GCPII inhibitors with efficient central nervous system penetration in order to address neurodegenerative disorders associated with excess glutamate signaling. Johns Hopkins researchers have identified L-DOPA, D-DOPA, and caffeic acid as novel inhibitors of GCPII. Using these compounds as scaffolds, they have synthesized prodrugs with enhanced CNS permeability. They have also explored the effectiveness of intranasal delivery for augmenting brain penetration. These novel GCPII inhibitors may provide additional therapeutic options for neurodegenerative disorders associated with excitotoxicity. Inventors have completed GCPII inhibitor design and have validated brain penetration in both mouse and primate models.",

Solid biopsies can be difficult to obtain and provide limited information on tumor composition. In recent years, liquid biopsies have allowed for non-invasive testing of circulating tumor-derived components, such as tumor cells or nucleic acids. However, the specificity and sensitivity of liquid biopsies can vary depending on the type and stage of cancer. The amount of circulating tumor-derived components can also be low and hard to detect, and false positives can occur due to the presence of circulating nucleic acids from other sources. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop liquid biopsy methods with improved sensitivity and specificity to enhance their clinical utility, improving health outcomes for patients with cancer. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a method for cancer detection in liquid biopsies that combines cell enrichment with a flow-cytometry based assay.

The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy may be as high as 39% among older adults living in the United States. Schwann cell transplantation represents a potential therapeutic approach for the repair of both acute and chronic peripheral nerve damage, since these cells play a key role in the native repair and remyelination processes. However, there are still significant barriers to the mass production of Schwann cells for clinical use, including issues with quality control, culture timelines, and enriching for cells with high levels of reproducible biological activity. Therefore, there is a clear need to improve methods for Schwann cell production and for identifying cultured cells with a functional myelinating phenotype. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a novel approach for the differentiation of hPSCs into functional Schwann cells that are highly capable of myelinating axons in both in vitro and in vivo models. Their method improves upon existing technology by a significant modification, which drives developing cells towards a functional, mature phenotype.

Inhibition of PER proteins allows cardiomyocytes to enter mitosis, which leads to increased proliferation and regeneration. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Heart failure arises when cardiomyocytes die (e.g., post-heart attack), as these cells have limited capacity for regeneration. They are instead replaced by fibrous tissue, resulting in a gradual loss of heart function. The standard-of-care in cases of severe heart failure is organ transplant, which carries significant risk. There are no regenerative therapies currently available for heart failure.

However, tools that evaluate the bio-machinery of LINE-1 and allow for the study of cellular events during LINE-1 expression and oncogenesis are limited. There is a strong need for the development of novel research tools that allow for the cancer cells to be evaluated in the context of LINE-1 expression.\n\nTechnology Overview\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a novel cell line containing a Tumor suppressor protein 53 (TP53) knockdown as well as an inducible LINE-1 transposable element. This invention may allow for further understandings of early disease development in various cancer types such as ovarian and colorectal cancer.\n\nStage of Development\nExperimental data and cell lines are available.",

Previous studies done by the investigators have shown that changes in T-cell metabolism and proliferation occur after AKI and can exacerbate the injury and repair. Data suggests that pre-treating mice before AKI with JHU083, a drug that targets T-cell metabolism, improves renal injury outcomes and prevents pathogenic T-cell metabolic reprograming, activation, and proliferation in-vivo.

Collectively, IRDs have an estimated incidence of 1:2000. Gene therapies targeting IRD, including FDA approved Luxturna, are injected directly into the retina to correct the underlying genetic defect. Viral gene therapy strategies have several limitations, including high cost, risk of cancer and immunological side effects, limited payload packaging capacity and suboptimal tissue-specific delivery. Therefore, there is a strong need for a non-viral gene therapy delivery vector to overcome the barriers associated with viral vectors and improve health outcomes for patients with IRD. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a synthetic polymer for non-viral vector for delivery of gene modification therapies to the eye. The delivery platform is applicable to various nucleic acid payloads (plasmid DNA, mRNA, siRNA, CRISPR/Cas9, etc.) and target tissues, such as ocular tissues. This methodology provides a standardized, scalable, and low-risk platform for gene modification therapy delivery and can be expanded for use across the human body.

    "ip_description": "Analysis of a complete blood count (CBC) test can help detect a plethora of diseases and conditions including leukemia, anemia, and blood infections. The information gained from a CBC analysis helps doctors treat any unusual symptoms, reduce risk of disease or complications, or simply help the patient make decisions to optimize their health. However, the current state of the art method requires blood to be drawn in order to perform a CBC test and analysis by running the blood sample through a hematology analyzer. The hematology analyzer then counts the blood cells and creates histograms for the clinician to view. Some hematology analyzers can detect size and shape of cells in addition to counting cells, which can further inform clinicians about any possible diseases or conditions that the patient may have. Existing hematology analyzers require laboratory equipment, expertise to operate, are expensive, and rely on on invasive blood draws for analysis. Thus, there is a need for a non-invasive, low-cost procedure that can perform fast and reliable CBC tests. There are also future areas of opportunity that would be enabled by such a system, such as monitoring temporal trends in blood constituents, observing cellular-endothelium interactions for the first time in-vivo to guide pharmaceutical agent development, and enabling a foundational new vital sign that could be exploited by machine learning technologies for improving patient care. Johns Hopkins inventors have designed a technology to enable non-invasive blood analysis through a mobile phone, tablet, or compact device. The technology consists of a capillaroscope that utilizes a cell-phone image sensor to acquire high speed videos of capillaries in the region of interest. The capillaroscope redirects light from flash in order to obliquely-illuminate the object in question through the objective lens. There is also a disposable cap with suction mechanism that stabilizes the field and prevents cross-contamination. The technology is coupled with a user-interface to guide the operator in positioning the capillaroscope properly to record high-quality videos. The user-interface automatically analyzes videos once complete and takes into account prior-knowledge (such as age, weight, ethnicity, etc.) as input, and outputs final diagnostic values similar to ones acquired from a complete blood count (CBC) test. Complete blood count is very useful for numerous diseases such as emergency triage, anemia, sickle cell disease, and overall health monitoring in the ICU.

    "ip_description": "According to the WHO, approximately 4.9 million people globally are affected by bacteria that leads to corneal scarring of the eye (WHO). Additionally, in the United States alone 4.88 million people age 50 and older suffer from dry eye, which may lead to scarring of the cornea (Healthline). The cornea serves as a window to the eye, and transparency is central to its function. The cornea is comprised of uniquely organized extracellular matrix biomaterials that provide tissue transparency and allow for vision. However, when this highly organized matrix structure is damaged, fibrotic scar tissue develops that leads to corneal opacity and vision obstruction. Conventional eye drops that are used to stop inflammation and prevent scar formation within the eye involve steroid compounds. However, these treatments can have significant limitations in that they may lead to corneal melting or glaucoma. Therefore, there is an unmet need for efficacious therapeutic options to treat traumatic injuries from physical and chemical abrasions, as well as cornea damage associated with the rising number of elective cornea surgical procedures. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a therapeutic modality whereby a pro-regenerative biomaterial can harness immune cells to promote a scar-less repair of the eye. This invention deploys a concept of regenerative immunotherapies by use of a biomaterial that is capable of targeting the immunological pathways, during ocular surface wound healing and inflammatory disease, for cornea repair. This therapy may easily be integrated into an eye-drop product or remain in liquid form for more advanced injection procedures.",

Direct current (DC) can excite, inhibit, or control extracellular potential of target neurons, but DC stimulation is biologically unsafe.

This approach degrades the fidelity of the DC signal by periodic current flow. Therefore, there is a strong need for a system to remove interruptions in DC flow for optimal performance of neural prostheses. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a neural prosthetic device for safer and more efficient treatment using DC stimulation by incorporating two safe DC stimulators in tandem.

Here, they have also developed an apparatus for surgical placement and securement of the MUSIC device. This apparatus, unlike existing ones in the field, is capable of adjusting an implant in all three dimensions along the spinal cord, enabling device placement to match patient-specific anatomy. Although developed for use with MUSIC, the apparatus could potentially be used with additional spinal implants. There are nearly 18,000 new cases of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States every year (see NSCISC). Currently, there are few methods to monitor the injury site and either provide damage information or aid in the healing process. A CT scan or MRI can be performed, but these give indirect readouts and can take a long time to complete. Additionally, there are currently no therapies approved by the FDA to enhance patient outcomes following SCI (see Hwang, 2021). SCI is generally treated in a prioritized manner, focusing on life-threatening symptoms like breathing and bleeding before addressing the neurological injury (see UptoDate), which can lead to more extensive damage. Therefore, there remains a severe need for SCI interventions to both monitor and treat the injury. This unmet need demands the use of novel solutions, such as the MUSIC neural implant, which needs to be placed, fixated and taken off manually and without damage to the surrounding tissues.

    "ip_description": "The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of rapid and sensitive testing for infectious material to limit the spread of a virus. The gold standard of testing is detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR has long been used in laboratory settings and can reliably detect viral infection at a highly sensitive level (CDC 2022). While sensitive and reliable, PCR testing is limited because the large demand for this assay causes results to be delayed. Additionally, these tests can only be performed in a lab setting that has a thermocycler, further limiting the access to fast results. Current PCR tests for COVID-19 testing are either provided at a medical facility or require patients to ship samples to a lab where testing can be performed. This limits access to tests and has delays in notifying patients of their status. To better cater to the demands of reliable PCR testing, there is a need to streamline sample testing to rapidly return results. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have discovered a method of improving the current state of polymerase chain reactions (PCR). Current methods of PCR require thermocyclers that continually change temperatures which limits the ability of non-lab environments to run medical tests that involve PCR.

These kinds of therapeutics require a nuanced and precise manufacturing process, including bioreactors and filtration systems that can reliably obtain large quantities of the desired product consistently. One challenge to this is the biofouling of tangential flow filtration membranes, or the build-up of undesired material that clogs the pores of the filters used to separate desired product from the rest of the cellular slurry. The current solution to this problem is frequent cleaning and/or replacement of filtration membranes, which is costly and inconvenient for uninterrupted production. One way to address this challenge would be to engineer a filtration system that does not get clogged with undesired bio-products and does not need to be replaced often. Thus, there is a strong need to develop a filtration membrane that resists biofouling in order to address this expensive challenge in biomanufacturing. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a zwitterionic peptide modification for filtration membranes that will form a hydration shell and prevent undesired product from entering membrane pores, making the modified membrane resistant to biofouling. This system does not impact cell viability, which is important in the continuous production of therapeutics and in reducing the cost of production. This type of membrane modification could significantly improve the ability to create cell-derived therapies and make them increasingly cost effective to manufacture, which could in turn reduce the cost for both patients and third-party payers.

    "ip_description": "Viral-based gene therapy holds tremendous promise for the treatment of human diseases. Using genetically engineered carriers called vectors to deliver genes into cells, gene therapy can help replace a mutated gene with a healthy copy or even introduce a new gene into the body to fight a disease. However, an important concern when designing these vectors is to ensure that genes are only delivered and expressed in the intended cell type. Since off-target delivery and expression can lead to side effects, current methods attempt to address these concerns by selecting virus serotypes (for vector) or constructing cell-specific promoters. Collectively, these current methods have significant limitations and as a result, gene therapy treatments have not succeeded in reaching their full therapeutic potential. As such, there is a need to create gene therapy vectors that will be able to specifically deliver and express into a defined cell type.\n\nJohns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel platform methodology for gene therapy. This method exploits alternative RNA splicing in order to precisely restrict gene expression to defined cell types. The technology uses cell type-specific alternative exons to drive cell type-specific gene expression (independent of any other sequence in the vector). Cell type-specific exons can be incorporated into gene expression constructs for viral-based gene therapies. By coupling cell type-specific splicing events to a desired translational reading frame, the technology ensures that the viral vector will only express encoded proteins in the target cell type.\n\nAdditionally, this vector technology is independent from other methods of controlling gene expression and can be easily used in conjunction with other strategies.

    "ip_description": "Electrical stimulation with neural implants plays a crucial role in restoring sensory and motor function, as well as treating neurological disorders, including Parkinson\u2019s disease, seizures, and even psychiatric disorders. Despite decades of research and development, neural implants only result in limited restoration of function in patients and optimal outcomes remain a challenge and patient recovery typically remains significantly below normal levels of function. System-specific explanations have been offered, ranging from unnatural recruitment of neurons to local interference based on physiology. To illustrate this issue, consider cochlear implants. Over 1 million people in the U.S. are considered deaf, with severe sensorineural hearing loss that do not benefit from hearing aids. Instead, cochlear implants are used to restore speech perception. However, cochlear implants cannot successfully restore pitch perception or music appreciation due to limitations in how sound is processed and converted into an electrical stimulus. Studies suggest that if auditory neurons were activated with fine timing closer to that of natural responses, pitch would be restored. Johns Hopkins (JHU) inventors have developed a fast algorithm for determining the optimal stimulation pattern to produce naturalistic responses in single neurons. This algorithm has two components. (1) It uses machine learning to efficiently determine desired local single neuron responses to inputs that would be naturalistic at real-time speeds. On a test set of auditory inputs, which is hidden during the training of the algorithm, it achieves a 4.4% error and runs 300 times faster than the state-of-the-art phenomenological model of sound processing in generating target cochlear responses to auditory input. This suggests that it is possible to integrate artificial intelligence into cochlear implants that can accurately predict normal physiological responses to sound and restore pitch perception, allowing patients with hearing loss to appreciate and listen to music again. (2) It includes a back-end that applies novel mathematical rules to pulsatile stimulation to account for disruptive effects of sequences of pulses on neural firing. The algorithm uses the range of viable pulse rate and pulse amplitude parameters and a measure spontaneous firing rate of neurons to predict the optimal pulse parameters to generate the target firing rate over time. In this case, the output of (1). The method can be applied to various types of neural implants, including cochlear, vestibular, retinal, deep brain, and spinal cord stimulators. Currently, the inventors have completed bench-top testing of the algorithm and expect to release the early version of the software on GitHub.",

    "ip_description": "Telomeres are repetitive sequences found at the end of eukaryotic chromosomes that play a key role in eukaryotic genomic stability. In humans, telomeres naturally shorten with time. Genetic disruption to telomere biology can cause dyskeratosis congenita and pulmonary fibrosis, while telomere length contributes to complex diseases such as cancer and aging. Current methods to measure telomere length focus on average length, as there is no standard assay to quantify the length of individual telomeres. These methods have limited reproducibility, bias toward short telomere length, and are relatively low-throughput. Therefore, there is a need to develop a standard and accurate technique to quantify telomere length. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a standardized assay for accurately quantifying telomere length. The methodology relies upon enrichment and subsequent sequencing of telomeres to quantify length. This approach is simple, high-throughput, scalable, and is appropriate for research and/or diagnostic use. Assay has been validated based on comparison to telomere length measured by Southern blot. Protocol is being optimized for multiplex applications.",

    "ip_description": "Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of death globally. A vaccine to prevent TB has not been approved since the development of the BCG vaccine in the early 20th century. New treatment paradigms using small molecule antibiotics have led to cures in a large proportion of individuals with drug-susceptible TB. The course of treatment though is often months long and requires combinations of up to four potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Moreover, drug-resistant TB is an emerging crisis in many parts of the developing world. The coalescence of these factors necessitates new strategies to aid in the course of treatment for TB. The inventors have identified a DNA vaccine product that codes for an antigen within the stringent response pathway necessary for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) survival. The vaccine is designed to be used in the setting of treatment in order to bolster immune-mediated clearance of the bacteria. For this reason, the inventors have designed their vaccine to code for the Mtb RelB protein fused to CCL20 to promote uptake by antigen presenting cells. The inventors have shown evidence that their vaccine product elicits production of a number of TB-protective cytokines in various tissues. The goal of this regimen is to shorten the total treatment time to achieve relapse free cure and limit drug resistance due to non-compliance. The inventors have tested immunogenicity of their vaccine candidate in a mouse model, and plan to perform a challenge study to assess efficacy.",

    "ip_description": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths. It is estimated to result in approximately 131880 deaths in the US annually and causes more deaths in men and women than prostate and breast cancer, respectively. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have become a useful therapeutic for certain cancers. However, the therapeutic effect varies between patients as response rates have dwindled. Specifically, PD1 (programmed death 1) blockade has shown efficacy in treating lung cancer, however the effects are not consistent as some patients fail to respond. This is due in part to an increase in patients developing resistance (acquired and primary) to blockade therapy. This has increased the need to improve patient outcomes as they relate to the potency of PD1 based immunotherapies. Johns Hopkins researchers have identified targets to enhance checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. These targets were identified by profiling T cells specific for non-small cell lung cancer. These potent targets may present opportunities for combination therapy to potentially improve the response rate and prevent or delay relapse after surgical resection. Preclinical data available.",

Despite the physiological importance of these channels, development of antibodies specific for the different Nav isoforms has been challenging. Johns Hopkins researchers have produced, purified and characterized two nanobodies, Nb17 and Nb82, which recognize human voltage gated Sodium Channels (Nav 1.4 and Nav 1.5). Nav 1.4 and Nav1.5 are the principal Nav isoforms in skeletal and cardiac muscle, respectively. These nanobodies recognize Nav 1.4 and Nav 1.5 with nM or higher affinity and without cross-reactivity tested to other isoforms. Applications for these nanobodies include, molecular Nav visualization agents (WB, ELISA, live cell imaging), bait proteins to capture and purify Navs from cell lysates, Nav channel modulators for tissue-specific targeting in health and disease and crystallization chaperones.

One of its most notable applications is efficient multiplexing of samples into batches by dedicating a number of metal isotope channels to barcodes, enabling robust data acquisition and analysis. Barcoding is most effective when markers are present in all cells of interest. While CD45 has been shown to be a reliable marker for barcoding all immune cells in a given sample, a strategy to reliably barcode mouse cancer cells has not been demonstrated. To this end, we identified CD29 and CD98 as markers widely expressed by commonly used mouse cancer cell lines. We conjugated anti-CD29 and anti-CD98 antibodies to cadmium or indium metals and validated their utility in 10-plex barcoding of live cells. Finally, we established a potentially novel barcoding system incorporating the combination of CD29, CD98, and CD45 to multiplex 10 tumors from s.c. MC38 and KPC tumor models, while successfully recapitulating the known contrast in the PD1-PDL1 axis between the 2 models.

Currently, there are no MS drugs in the market that have neuromodulatory property, which in itself makes this compound innovative, and this molecule has additional benefit of immunosuppression that is also vital in treating MS. This molecule improves the neurological symptoms by increasing the differentiation of OPCs. Treatment of mouse-derived neurospheres, which are clusters of neural stem cells, with the compound resulted in increased levels of O4 (an oligodendrocyte marker) expression. Increase in OPC differentiation can result in increased remyelination of neurons, which is crucial in treating MS, a demyelinating disease. Johns Hopkins researchers have tested their novel compound in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model for multiple sclerosis. The mice are immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), which induces demyelination of neurons resulting in muscle weakness and paralysis, which are also observed in human MS, and is therefore a standard mouse model for MS. When the compound was injected into mice with EAE, the neurological symptoms were almost completely abolished. cells have already taken place, and therefore, only the neurological deficits remain with very minor immune activation. Results from this experiment showed that there was an improvement in the neurological symptoms, suggesting that this molecule could also repair the CNS damage created by the immune cells.",

    "ip_description": "According to WHO, over one billion people worldwide are living with elevated blood pressure which may lead to a range of adverse health conditions that cause ~1,100 deaths per day. Many current high blood pressure therapies focus on angiotensin receptor blocking drugs. Unfortunately, adverse events (e.g., renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and hypotension) limit the duration of their administration regimen. As such, there is a warranted need for new therapeutic strategies. Recently, Johns Hopkins researchers identified a \u2018mitochondrial angiotensin system\u2019 (MAS) with functional angiotensin II receptors. These mitochondrial based angiotensin II receptors offer novel targets for anti-inflammatory therapies that may improve the current standard of treatment. Building on this discovery, the investigators have developed a method for the targeted delivery of \u2018mitochondrial angiotensin receptor blockers\u2019 (MARBs) to the mitochondrial angiotensin system for the treatment of diseases caused by angiotensin-related mitochondrial dysfunction. The invention describes a novel composition comprising the conjugation of a MARB therapeutic agent to a peptidyl \u2018mitochondrial targeting signal\u2019 (MTS), which selectively delivers therapeutic moieties to the desired component of the mitochondria (outer membrane, inter-membrane space, inner membrane or matrix). Furthermore, this type of conjugated modification can also be used to transport imaging agents (e.g., fluorophore) to selective zones of the mitochondrion for additional imaging studies. By specifically targeting drugs to angiotensin II type 2 receptors in human mitochondria much lower doses will be needed thereby reducing the systemic side effects for treatments aimed at maintaining mitochondrial functions while reducing oxidative stress damage and potentially leading to improved muscle function, physical fitness and delay the signs of aging.

    "ip_description": "The disclosed technology is a novel approach to diagnosing cancer, by looking for loss of methylation stability in gene expression instead of searching for specific methylation profiles. The conventional approach to identifying epigenetic cancer markers is by querying the methylation profiles at specific sites within the DNA. This technology highlights a fundamentally novel approach to diagnosing cancer by providing evidence that cancer may not have a specific methylation profile. Instead it has an \u201canti-profile\u201d, a stochastic deviation from normal. Other advantages include:\n\n\u2022 Discovery of a new mechanism for cancer, \u201cgene expression heterogeneity\u201d, that allows cells to grow despite varying challenges (chemotherapy, hypoxia, metastasis).\n\u2022 Uses standard techniques to detect cancer from as few as 10-25 CpG sites.\n\u2022 Methods to identify hypomethylated blocks associated with cancer and \u201cmethylation boundary shifts\u201d at CpG islands that result in hypermethylation of the CpG islands and shores.\n\u2022 A safer alternative to current drug hypomethylation strategies, as hypomethylation is likely to cause or accelerate tumor development.

Enhances drug retention in the lung for local treatment via inhalation. Formulation allows for long-term storage and remote shipping. Surface-stabilized with adsorptive non-adhesive polymer coatings to overcome biological delivery in the lung barriers to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Silicosis is an irreversible and progressive fibrotic lung disease caused by inhalation of large amounts of crystalline silica. There are no proven therapies specifically for silicosis; therefore, treatment is limited to supportive therapies such as bronchodilators and glucocorticoids. Oral formulations of nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, are used to treat other fibrotic lung diseases and may slow progression and relieve symptoms, but do not reverse or cure the disease with the current dosage form. Current oral formulations of nintedanib have an adverse side effect profile and would be required in large doses to achieve optimal therapeutic effect in the lung. A significant portion of an oral formulation will not reach the lung. Therefore, there is a strong need for nintedanib to be developed to address side effect and bioavailability concerns with current oral formulations. Current oral formulations of NTB are associated with adverse events. In order to target the lung, larger dosages would be needed to ensure proper availability at the expense of systemic toxicity. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a nanocrystal-based suspension formulation of nintedanib (NTB), to be inhaled intranasally. This formulation provides enhanced stability in the body and has the ability to overcome biological delivery barriers. Additionally, it can be lyophilized for long-term storage and transportation.

Recent advances in 3D printing have focused on the introduction of new, advanced materials such as refractory ceramics. Ultra-high temperature metal carbide ceramics in particular are optimal structural materials for applications that require resiliency to extreme temperatures (>2000\u00b0C), oxidation, corrosion, and wear (e.g. titanium carbide, TiC). The AM of these materials has not been fully realized due to the incompatibility of their properties with current AM techniques. Due to their numerous applications in aerospace, energy generation, and tooling, there is a growing need for new 3D printing techniques for next-generation refractory ceramic components. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed a two-step process for the additive manufacturing of carbide ceramics, including UHTCs. The first step involves selective laser sintering of a ceramic precursor, followed by post-processing in reactive gas to convert the green part into a carbide final product. The system is reaction synthesis based and can be readily adapted to the workflows of existing commercially available 3D Printers. It has achieved sub-millimeter precision and produced high-quality standalone ceramic parts that are not otherwise producible using existing techniques.

    "ip_description": "Cancer treatment is an ongoing endeavor across the globe and there have been many milestones achieved recently in successfully treating cancer, such as immunotherapy and gene therapies. The current gold standards for the treatment of blood cancers include chemotherapy, radiation, stem cell transplants, surgery, and immunotherapy. Each of the treatment options have their own benefits and downsides, such as immunosuppression, invasiveness, off-target effects, and failure to detect mutated and transformed cancer cells. This results in the need for the development of new and novel cancer therapies such as immune stimulating antibody conjugates (ISAC). ISACs are a subcategory of the clinically-approved antibody drug conjugates being used in cancer treatment today; instead of carrying a cytotoxic payload, ISAC contains a biologic that stimulates both innate and adaptive immune responses against the detected cancer cells. Despite its potential, there are no clinically-approved ISACs; therefore, there is a strong need for the development and advancement of new ways to combine tumor targeting antibodies with immune stimulating agonists. Inventors at Johns Hopkins have developed a novel way to target certain cancer cells to be destroyed by the host immune system, by promoting cancer cell phagocytosis and subsequent stimulation of cancer-specific adaptive immune response.

Technical Details:  BACKGROUND  Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from existing ones, is essentially required during embryonic development, formation of vasculature, wound healing and rebuilding of the uterus lining. When angiogenesis becomes unregulated for reasons that are not fully appreciated, growth pathologies such as diabetic vasculopathies, tumor growth, arthritis and other inflammatory diseases result. Specifically in cancer, however, the detection of growth pathology has not yet been realized in the clinic, such that diagnosis comes too late for early treatment or surgical intervention. Early detection of cancer is integral for improved survival outcomes.  TECHNOLOGY  This technology offers diagnostic application as a biomarker for colon cancer. In human colon cancer endothelial cells, the mRNA transcript of an isoform of an enzyme involved in the angiogenic signaling pathway was markedly over expressed 4.5-fold in human tumor endothelial cells compared to normal human endothelial cells, thus enabling efficient and early detection of unregulated angiogenesis in human colon cancer. Looking for Partners:  This invention has application as a biomarker that involves the use of elevated levels of mRNA as a biomarker for colon cancer.

As demonstrated in ex vivo and in vivo studies labeled EVs preferentially bind to B cells. Therefore, the disclosed process can be exploited as a platform to treat B cell diseases through targeted delivery, including treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer. Extracellular vesicles are increasingly regarded as promising delivery vehicles for various therapeutic cargoes, however, lack of understanding of the pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties and resulting off-target effects are hindering clinical translation of EVs. Therefore, there is a need for EVs with improved cell-specificity and half-life for therapeutic applications.",

    "ip_description": "Unmet Need\n Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized with misfolded \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) accumulation in Lewy bodies (LB). Although some \u03b1-syn mutations have been associated with familial PD, the majority cases are sporadic with unknown etiology. Tremendous efforts have been made to develop a sporadic PD model with \u03b1-syn spreading model for mechanism study and therapeutic development. The \u03b1-syn preformed fibrils (PFF) model is groundbreaking that a single injection of recombinant \u03b1-syn PFF can replicate LB-like pathology spreading, neurotoxicity and motor/non-motor dysfunction in wildtype mice. The PFF model can perfectly mimic the sporadic PD; however, limited nanomaterials have been reported to prevent prion-like spread. Another critical issue is the biological effect of nanomaterials. Metal oxides nanoparticles are prone to cause uncertain biological effects due to unstable multivalent metals on the surface. Therefore, there is a critical need to explore the potential of metal alloy nanozymes in preventing prion-like spreading induced by oxidative stress in the sporadic PD model.\n\n Technology Overview\n Johns Hopkins researchers have proposed a series of in nitro and in vivo experiments to address the question that nanozyme can prevent prion-like spreading. The report has shown that the PtCu nanoalloys (NAs) functionally mimic three redox enzymes, including peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase and demonstrate superior antioxidant capability in a cell-free system. Furthermore, we tested the effects of PtCu NAs in sporadic Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) models by using recombinant \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) preformed fibrils (PFF). Treatment with the PtCu NAs significantly reduced the \u03b1-syn PFF-induced ROS in mouse primary cortical neurons, and subsequently decreased \u03b1-syn PFF-induced pathology and neurotoxicity. Moreover, we\u2019ve found that the treatment with PtCu NAs significantly blocked pathologic \u03b1-syn cell-to-cell transmission in microfluidic chambers and in intrastriatal \u03b1-syn PFF injection model of PD. These data, taken together, have shown that biocompatible PtCu NAs have therapeutic potential to prevent pathologic \u03b1-syn cell-to-cell transmission in PD and related \u03b1-synucleinopathies.\n\n Stage of Development\n The in nitro and in vivo experiments data has been developed.",

There are several applications for this technology, ranging from educational purposes for teaching students to a medical application for anatomical study and surgeon cutting path in surgery. The impact of projection mapping is immense, yet there are a few shortcomings that need to be addressed for optimal application and practicality. In conventional projection mapping, both the projection and screen are fixed, causing there to be difficulty in using a large and heavy device that is not able to project images or videos anywhere in 3D space. There is an unmet need for a device that addresses the mobility, size, weight, and actual projected images or videos that result from its use. In addition, this device should not require a head mounted display as this limits mobility and application while also limiting access to patient data. There is an unmet for this device to be hand-held with augmenting capabilities to allow for transparent access to patient data. The inventors have developed a novel Portable Projection Mapping Device (PPMD) that consists of a projector, video camera, depth camera, and inertia measurement unit (IMU). The images that are taken can project images or videos anywhere in 3D space, and can range from virtual internal tissues, surgical virtual plans, and virtual hardware. Other features of this hand-held device include being lightweight, small, and allowing multiple users to view the projection at the same time. It addresses several unmet needs of the types of images and videos that are allowed to be taken, the size and weight, and the improved practicality of the portable design. In addition, this device has augmenting capabilities so that patient data can be accessed at any point and be overlaid. Furthermore, this device can be used for educational purposes, in that it has the ability to overlay the internal anatomy on to a subject\u2019s body for overall learning.

There is an unmet need to develop a novel, high-content and high-resolution method for reconstructing 3D tissues in large volumetric landscapes to both further disease understanding and serve as a basis for biomarker and drug development. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a computational method for the 3D reconstruction of tissue from imaging data. The method, called CODA, utilizes nonlinear image registration, color deconvolution, and deep learning semantic segmentation to create a digital tissue volume from serially sectioned hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histological samples and identify and label single cells and tissue subtypes. The result is a multi-labelled digital 3D map of cm-scale volumes of tissue at micrometer and single cell resolution. The CODA platform can be paired with additional single-cell analysis tools such as immunofluorescence and next-gen sequencing to provide a detailed single-cell tissue landscape in disease.

    "ip_description": "Trigeminal neuralgia is a condition that affects the fifth cranial nerve, caused either via trigeminal nerve compression or secondary to another medical condition (i.e., multiple sclerosis, facial injury, tumors, etc.). Trigeminal neuralgia results in severe orofacial pain that is exceptionally debilitating, with a profound effect on one\u2019s quality of life (JHU, 2022). This condition affects approximately 13 per 100,000 people, and is one of the more frequently seen neuralgias in the older adult population, as incidence increases gradually with age (UpToDate, 2022). First line treatment options for trigeminal neuralgia include anti-convulsants. For patients that fail to respond to first-line therapy, surgical referrals are recommended. Unfortunately, surgical interventions for medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia present the risk for anesthesia dolorosa\u2014a condition more intolerable than the pain from classic trigeminal neuralgia itself. Additionally, significant side effects are associated with present pharmacological interventions. Therefore, there is a strong need for alternative pharmacological interventions to be developed to address the present, limited, and ineffective pharmacological treatment modalities for trigeminal neuralgia. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a treatment modality, that is neither an anti-epileptic, nor opiate to treat breakthrough pain in trigeminal neuralgia. The implications of these small molecules are significant, as they may prove to be more effective than first-line pharmacological interventions or effective for medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia.

    "ip_description": "Unmet Need: Toxoplasmic Encephalitis (TE) is a life-threatening central nervous system (CNS) disorder that results from the reactivation of a chronic brain infection with Toxoplasma gondii. Chronic T. gondii infection poses a constant and severe danger in situations of immunodeficiency as can occur in HIV infection, organ transplantation, or cancer chemotherapy. Disease burden will likely increase as immunosuppression for solid-organ and stem-cell transplant patients becomes more frequent in the United States and other areas of the world. Because TE progresses rapidly, early diagnosis is crucial for optimal patient outcomes. The primary diagnostic assay for TE is a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay that targets the multicopy B1 gene and AF146527 elements. However, because T gondii infection is located in the brain, direct measurement of infection is difficult. Toxoplasma DNA can be detected in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and blood from symptomatic patients with TE. However, the use of these assays is generally limited to the time of diagnosis. They offer little predictive value in determining risk of infection. Due to the rapid onset and often fatal nature of TE, there exists an unmet need to design a robust diagnostic tool to determine risk of TE in immunocompromised populations. Technology Overview: Inventors at Johns Hopkins developed a non-invasive method for predicting the risk of TE via a serological assay for antibodies to a chimeric MAG1 antigen specific for the chronic phase of the Toxoplasma parasite. Preliminary data support the predictive value for TE of a positive test up to 2 years prior to the clinical diagnosis of TE in patients with HIV. The invention could support closer clinical monitoring for determining when aggressive prophylactic or therapeutic therapy is appropriate. Stage of Development 1. The serological assay employs synthetic peptides which can be produced economically with ultra-high purity and in large quantities. 2. The synthetic peptides are chimeric antigens with linkers between different regions of the MAG1 protein. The antigens were identified through a combination of bioinformatics analysis of protein antigenicity and empirical studies. 3. The inventors demonstrate the predictive value of the MAG1 assay for TE in HIV infected patients several years prior to clinical diagnosis. 4. Commercialization of the technology will require development of an optimized ultrasensitive immunoassay and determination of predictive value for TE in defined clinical populations.",

They have identified genes in a CSC-specific pathway that contribute to their drug resistance and have further found small molecules that inhibit these genes. Studies have demonstrated efficacy of these small molecules in mice where combination of their small molecules with conventional chemotherapy suppressed the growth of human lung adenocarcinoma tumors. Despite treatment advances, lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, with late-stage diagnosis having a 5-year survival rate of only 12%. There were an estimated 236,760 new cases of lung cancer and 130,180 lung cancer deaths in the United States in 2022, according to the American Cancer Society. Among subtypes of lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma is the most common in the United States. Treatment options include surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy; however, the presence of CSCs reduces treatment efficacy and increases the likelihood of relapse and/or metastasis. Following chemotherapy, CSCs may persist and reestablish tumors following remission. Patients with CSCs have poor prognosis following treatment by current methods. Therefore, there is a strong need for a CSC-targeted therapy that can enhance current treatments and improve long-term survival in lung adenocarcinoma.

In 2017, for every 100,000 women, 125 new Female Breast Cancer cases were reported and 20 women died of breast cancer (see CDC, 2020). Currently, mammography is the primary screening approach for breast cancer with limitations such as occult disease as well as breast tissue density. Occult breast cancer is a major challenge as an individual is positive for breast cancer but mammography is unable to detect the abnormality (see Ofri et al.). These challenges highlight the need for molecular based technologies that guide the detection of breast cancer. One molecular candidate that may pose an ideal target is aberrant thymosin-beta 10 (T\u03b210) expression that has been correlated with high grade, aggressive breast cancer and shown to promote progression to metastasis (see Verghese-Nikolakak, et al.). Harnessing molecular and imaging agent chemistry may address the strong need for both new imaging modalities that improve breast cancer detection as well as therapeutic delivery systems to treat cancer. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed two clinically translatable biomarker-based imaging agents that provide detection of malignancies such as breast cancer, with the potential to evolve into novel therapeutics used for more effective treatment of cancers. More specifically, the technology involves a biomarker compound with a radioisotope that could serve as an imaging agent in positron emission tomography (PET), enabling early detection and diagnosis.

The fungus is taken up by direct contact with the mosquito and inhibits Plasmodium development. Unmodified, Metarhizium anisopliae kills mosquitoes slowly. If mosquitoes are infected by the fungus shortly after ingesting malaria causing Plasmodium transmission potential is reduced by 98%. Unfortunately, it is difficult to ensure prompt fungal infection. It has been shown that the modified M. anisopliae detailed here expresses the encoded transgenic information within 20 minutes, and that the formed products interact with sporozoites and the salivary glands. This modification will reduce transmission potential of malaria prior to mosquito death. This modified M. anisopliae can be used interchangeably with currently available chemical insecticides, persists on some surfaces for months and can also be used to combat insecticide resistant strains and insects with advanced malarial infections. Johns Hopkins and University of Maryland researchers have developed a transgenic fungus to reduce the transmission of malaria by targeting sporozoite development in mosquitoes. M. anisopliae is a fungus that infects mosquitoes and proliferates in their hemolymphs, eventually killing them. By modifying this fungus to express molecules that target sporozoites in the hemolymphs and salivary glands, the ability to transmit malaria is significantly reduced. Preliminary results have shown that the transgenic information is expressed in a little as 20 minutes. This would reduce transmission of malaria while allowing the mosquitoes to live long enough to continue a part of their reproductive cycle, which will limit the extent to which M. anisopliae resistant strains develop.",

    "ip_description": "Global revenue from the cytokine therapeutics market was valued at approximately $16.5 billion in 2018, and cytokine immunotherapy is a promising field of anti-cancer treatments for a broad range of cancer types. In particular, interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy is shown to stimulate anti-cancer immunity. However, IL-2 activates contradictory immune responses by promoting both the activity of immune effector cells (which stimulate immune activity), and regulatory T cells (which suppress immune activity), resulting in harmful off-target effects such as severe vascular leak syndrome, which can lead to edema and organ failure. Additionally, IL-2 is plagued by a low rate (5-10%) of durable responses in patients and a short serum half-life (<5min). IL-2 immunotherapy can be improved by forming complexes between the cytokine and an antibody called S4B6. IL-2/S4B6 complexes are able to promote the activity of effector cells while minimizing activation of regulatory T-cells, thus improving the anti-cancer response and avoiding the adverse suppressive effects seen with unbound IL-2. However, clinical translation of the IL-2/S4B6 complex is hindered by logistical hurdles such as ensuring complex stability to avoid dissociation of the complex into free IL-2, which can induce dangerous toxicities and has poor pharmacokinetic properties. Also, the S4B6 antibody binds to mouse IL-2, but has limited reactivity with human IL-2 (hIL-2). Thus, there is an unmet need for an IL-2/antibody complex that is compatible with hIL-2, has a stable complex configuration and clinically relevant serum half-life, and selectively engages effector cells to minimize off-target toxicities. A human analog form of S4B6 was isolated (denoted \u2018602\u2019) and conjugated to hIL-2, creating a hIL-2/602 complex that served as the basis for designing a single-chain IL-2/602 fusion construct. Synthesizing the complex as a single-chain construct prevents the complex from dissociating into free IL-2 and an antibody, thus avoiding the toxicities typically found with unbound IL-2 or dissociated IL-2/antibody complexes. Also, the single-chain format extends the serum half-life of the cytokine, allowing IL-2/602 to target tissue for a longer period of time, which can improve durability of the patients\u2019 immune response. Unlike unbound IL-2, which nonspecifically upregulates both immune effector cell and regulatory T cell activities, the complex selectively promotes immune effector cell activity. This activates a powerful anti-cancer response that is not suppressed by regulatory T cells, and reduces the adverse side effects associated with standard IL-2 therapy. The IL-2/602 single-chain construct also takes advantage of the universal importance of the immune response in cancer, and thus can be used to treat a wide range of malignancies. Moreover, this approach can be readily coupled with other immunotherapeutic strategies such as vaccines, adoptive cell transfer, and immune checkpoint blockade.",

The device harnesses photoacoustic imaging, pairing LED lights with ultrasonic detectors to monitor flow even in small vessels. The device simultaneously measures clinical data on variables such as pulse oximetry, integrates waveform analysis to estimate parameters such as stroke volume, and utilizes machine learning to monitor for early warning signs. Continuous blood pressure data is critical for patient monitoring in both in- and outpatient settings, as static measurements may fail to capture dynamic blood pressure variation. Invasive monitoring via arterial catheter is the gold standard for continuous blood pressure monitoring due to its beat-to-beat accuracy. However, this approach requires frequent troubleshooting and may lead to complications (e.g., infection, arterial injuries). Non-invasive approaches for continuous monitoring also have significant limitations. Wave Doppler devices are bulky, expensive, and vulnerable to movement artifacts, while finger sensors are uncomfortable, unreliable in patients with impaired finger perfusion, and inaccurate. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop accurate methods for continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring to improve health outcomes through comprehensive patient data collection. The technology allows for cost-effective remote patient monitoring in-home or hospital settings, captures high-resolution, real-time blood flow dynamics, overcoming motion-related artifacts, collects data for small vessels that cannot be well-monitored using current methods, and integrates multiparametric patient data to enhance clinical care.

To address the need for rapid and detailed medical imaging, researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a dual-spectrum photoacoustic imaging technology for real-time super-resolution imaging for guided surgeries. This medical imaging technology can differentiate unique tissue components, demarcating diseased target tissue from healthy tissue and/or organ substructures. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a dual-spectrum photoacoustic imaging and analysis technology that enables rapid acquisition of high-resolution images in superficial and deep tissue. Lasers are used to excite and expand specific molecules in the body; this expansion leads to sound wave emissions which are subsequently detected via ultrasound. Using two spectra of lasers and a unique data unmixing algorithm, researchers demonstrated that two tissue components can be differentiated simultaneously, facilitating demarcation of different tissues or structures in real-time. One proposed use is to demarcate uterine arteries from ureters during guided hysterectomies, reducing common collateral injuries during these procedures.",

Technology is easily scalable to other devices.

This can interfere with diagnoses and treatments, and therefore, there is a need to counteract this impact of ICDs on MRI images. Engineers at the Johns Hopkins University have designed a force-balanced static magnetic field shim coil which can counter the magnetic field distortion caused by ICDs during MRI imaging and thereby permit imaging of the heart regions that currently cannot be imaged. The device is placed in the bore of the MRI machine, and when driven by appropriate electrical currents, allows for proper images to be taken of patients with implanted ICDs. The technology has been evaluated in phantoms and swine models with overlaid ICDs and the preliminary results published in journal abstracts. An NIH SBIR phase 1 award was made in Mid-2022.

Johns Hopkins researchers identified the role of glycosphingolipids in atherosclerotic plaque formation and developed a biopolymer capsule to enhance delivery of a glycolipid synthesis inhibitor with absorptive properties within the circulatory system. This invention also demonstrates a direct relationship between observed stenosis (blood vessel narrowing) seen among atherosclerotic or inflamed vessels with elevated oxidative low density lipoproteins (OxLDL) levels. Heightened OxLDL levels, promote lipid enzymatic activity in smooth muscle cells that in turn amplify Lactosylceramide; a glycosphingolipid inflammatory signal cascades causing cell growth or lumen vessel narrowing.

While many HCM patients live normal lives, some are at risk for severe cardiac complications, including sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmia (VA). VA risk is currently evaluated in HCM patients based on standardized clinical criteria published by the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). These guidelines have been reported to have inconsistent accuracies in different cohorts, with lower diagnostic capabilities for persons of color and ethnic minority groups.

The resulting patient-specific hiPSC lines are stable, possess transcriptional, epigenetic, and biochemical features of human na\u00efve epiblast, and are marked by high epigenetic plasticity, improved genomic integrity and superior multi-lineage functionality relative to conventional hiPSC. The researchers also developed a method for establishing defined, clinical-grade universal donor banks of multi-lineage progenitor cells from these novel na\u00efve hiPSC lines for use with drug-mediated allogeneic tissue transplantation tolerance strategies.\n\nValue Proposition: \n\nThe methods are current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)-compliant  \nThe novel class of na\u00efve hiPSC overcome the limited differentiation efficiency and poor functionality of conventional patient-specific hiPSC \nUniversal hiPSC banks offer off-the-shelf regenerative cellular therapies \nLooking for Partners to: Develop & commercialize the technology as novel methods for generating clinical-grade donor-specific and universal donor therapeutic progenitors \n\nStage of Development: Pre-Clinical\n\nData Availability: in vitro & in vivo",

Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed an automated testing platform for the detection of nucleic acids encapsulated within exosomal or small EVs for diagnosis of disease. EVs can be isolated based on parent cell type, allowing for the tissue-specific detection of upregulated miRNAs that are associated with cell damage and disease. Test data is analyzed using an automated platform, and results can be downloaded to any smart device. Diagnostic tests for diabetes, such as A1C tests, glucose tolerance tests, and fasting blood sugar tests, are time consuming for patients (i.e., requiring an office visit) and are often performed after symptom onset, rather than proactively. Additionally, these tests are subject to a high rate of false positives. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop additional test platforms to enhance efficiency, sensitivity, and frequency of proactive screening. Proof of concept studies complete. Automated testing panels are in development for platform validation in larger patient cohorts.

    "ip_description": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting an estimated 32.5 million adults in the United States, with an increasing incidence as the population ages (see CDC). OA is associated with considerable morbidity as a consequence of joint damage, resulting in pain, loss of joint range of motion, and disability. The disease is marked by considerable articular cartilage damage. Due to the low mitotic activity of the cells and the avascularity of the tissue, cartilage does not effectively self-repair. Treatment for OA remains largely related to pain relief, with additional use of injectable viscosupplements and corticosteroids, which may provide transient periods of improvement, but do not inhibit joint damage. Surgical interventions with joint replacements, while ultimately curative of OA are associated with morbidity and considerable cost. There is thus a considerable need to develop new tissue-engineering strategies that may help to both induce tissue regeneration in a diseased joint environment, while decreasing joint inflammation and pain. Johns Hopkins researchers have identified a butanoylated GlcNAc derivative, 3,4,6-O-Bu3GlcNAc, that has the potential to stimulate new tissue production and reduce inflammation in IL-1\u03b2-induced chondrocytes with utility for OA and other forms of inflammatory arthritis.",

This technique captures images both before and after injection of radiopaque contrast; images are then subtracted from one another, leaving only contrast enhanced vasculature in the final image.

Such vessels are important in a number of clinical scenarios (e.g., vascular malformation, tumors, brain vasospasm, brain vasculitis). The inability to clearly visualize small vessels in these scenarios exposes patients to repeat catheterization procedures and increased risk of misdiagnosis.

The cause of PD is currently unknown, and no specific tests exist to diagnose the disease. Neurologists diagnose PD based on medical history, signs and symptoms, as well as neurological and physical examinations. As a result, many patients go undiagnosed for up to two years, and the diagnosis is incorrect around 10% of the time, with the most common error being the inability to differentiate between PD and other forms of parkinsonism. On the other hand, although there is currently no cure for the disease, early intervention can reduce symptoms and potentially slow disease progression. However, there is currently no specific test to monitor PD progression. Thus, specific tests are urgently needed to properly diagnose PD and effectively monitor disease progression to help patients and physicians recognize and manage the disease earlier. The inventors have created a serum and blood plasma-based method to diagnose PD and monitor disease progression. In order to improve prognostication, the inventors used c-Abl pathway molecules as biomarkers. Current evidence indicates that tyrosine phosphorylated c-Abl is elevated in the brains of PD patients and is also activated as part of PD pathogenesis. Through investigation of the c-Abl pathway, the inventors have found that multiple substrates such as c-Abl, \u03b1-syn, and tyrosine phosphorylated \u03b1-syn serve as effective biomarkers for diagnosing PD and differentiating PD from other forms parkinsonism. These specific biomarkers have the potential to be used for clinical diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and potentially as theranostic markers.

IgFold consists of a pre-trained language model trained on 558 million natural antibody sequences followed by graph networks that directly predict backbone atom coordinates. IgFold predicts structures of similar or better quality than alternative methods in significantly less time. IgFold also provides accuracy estimations for each residue, which is helpful for determining whether to trust a predicted structure. As an example, IgFold predicted structures for 1.4 million paired antibody sequences, providing structural insights to 500-fold more antibodies than have experimentally determined structures.",

    "ip_description": "Continuous ultrasound imaging of blood vessels in the leg to detect abnormalities in blood flow. This technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor ultrasound images and assess the risk and diagnose deep vein thrombosis early. Current DVT diagnosis relies on clinicians to monitor at risk patients and does not allow for continuous, hands-free monitoring for DVT. Other continuous ultrasound imaging devices being developed do not have AI screening methods that are crucial for monitoring abnormalities in blood flow. This technology offers the ability to automatically direct the signals from the transducer to locate the region of interest when placed in the vicinity of, e.g., the deep veins on the lower limb. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a wearable imaging device that can monitor blood flow abnormalities and development of deep vein thrombosis over time in high-risk patients. This technology can automatically steer the imaging focus to the deep veins and continuously monitor blood flow in the lower extremities with ultrasound technology to detect abnormalities that are indicative of impending development and early detection of deep vein thrombosis. The use of artificial intelligence eliminates the need for expert placement and allows the device to alert clinicians when an abnormality is detected such that DVT treatment can begin expeditiously. Deep vein thrombosis commonly develops in patients who are stationary for prolonged periods of time, which makes surgical and intensive care unit patients a high-risk population for developing DVT. DVT diagnosis involves a positive D-dimer test followed up by a manual compression Duplex ultrasound test of lower extremities. Unfortunately, testing for DVT does not typically occur in patients who do not exhibit or report swelling and other risk factors causing many ICU patients to go untested or tested once a week, which is a large gap for a potentially rapidly developing pathology. Therefore, there is a need for an easy and reliable method of monitoring patients for the development of DVT without relying on manual intervention.",

Gene therapy is a developing medical field and there is a need for systems that can rapidly and efficiently deliver therapeutic products to the site of action. siRNA based gene therapy is one such approach and its ability to efficiently target expression of specific genes is well known. But systems that can deliver siRNA in a non-toxic and rapid manner have been lacking. This invention meets this need. It overcomes limitations of current gene delivery systems such as viral based vectors, liposomes and biodegradable polymers using siRNA targeted gene knockdown. Advantages include: \u2022 Rapid release of payload ensures efficient delivery and targeting of genes into specific cells \u2022 The polymer has little to no toxicity \u2022 Stable and enhanced siRNA delivery. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed methods to synthesize a bioreducible polymer that efficiently and rapidly delivers siRNA into a cell for targeted knockdown of gene expression. This was achieved by including disulfide bonds into backbone of the poly(Beta amino) ester. The disulfide bonds are reduced in the human body by glutathione (GSH) resulting in the rapid and efficient release of the siRNA cargo into the cytoplasm of the cell and leading to the efficient knockdown of target genes. The reducible polymer has the same physical properties as previously developed non-bioreducible polymers but possess a lower toxicity profile. Thus, this invention provides a safe and efficacious siRNA delivery platform for gene therapy targeting various diseases.",

    "ip_description": "Unmet Need: Active immunotherapy, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint blockage, involves the administration of molecules to mobilize host immune cells to recognize and kill tumors. Proper presentation of tumor antigens through antigen presenting cells is a prerequisite to elicit a potent immune response. Current strategies enhance antigen presentation by boosting conventional CD11b+ dendritic cells. While these are potent in antigen presentation, they perform subpar cross presentation. FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 Ligand (Flt3L) is believed to expand CD8a+, CD103+, and Plasmacytoid dendritic cell subsets that have been shown to be effective at cross priming CD8+ cytotoxic T cells to promote anti-tumor activities; yet one drawback of Flt3L treatment is the need for daily injections due to its short half-life in vivo and its inability to target to the tumor location and the draining lymph nodes. Technology Overview: Johns Hopkins researchers have generated a fusion protein between albumin and Flt3L (Alb-Flt3L) as a means to extend the cytokine\u2019s half-life and promote trafficking to the lymphatic system. The fusion protein was shown potently expand cross priming dendritic cell populations in vivo following a single weekly injection, eliminating the need for daily injections of native Flt3L. In addition to exhibiting similar biological activity to the native Flt3L, the fusion protein can engender antigen specific T and B cell responses to OVA and HPV protein E7 long peptide immunizations. Hence, administering Alb-Flt3L in combination with additional chemotherapeutic agents, radiation therapy or immunotherapy is proposed as a promising new strategy to enhance therapeutic efficacy and improve patient outcome. Stage of Development: The inventors have conducted pre-clinical research to evaluate the efficacy of their structurally well-characterized fusion protein in modulating immune cell phenotypes to promote anti-tumor immunity and antigen specific T cell responses. Alb-Flt3L appears to generate cross priming dendritic cell populations in vitro. The fusion protein also appears to extend the half-life of the cytokine versus the native protein and to target to the tumor location and the draining lymph node. In various mouse models of cancer, single weekly injections of the fusion protein reduced tumor burden and increased overall survival compared to control mice. An IND application can be reached within 18 months with appropriate funding.",

    "ip_description": "In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, a variety of vaccines have been rapidly developed to prevent serious illness or death from infection by SARS-CoV-2. The gold standard are mRNA vaccines which deliver mRNA to make copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which ultimately activates immunes cells to produce antibodies against the real protein. However, these vaccines are not always as effective against variants of the virus. Therefore, there is a need for a vaccine that can target a wider variety of SARS viruses to prevent infection from variants. A Vaccine that targets the most conserved and functionally important regions of the SARS virus. Able to target many different subtypes of SARS viruses and stockpile for future Coronavirus pandemics. Capable of inducing a T cell response that can work synergistically with an antibody inducing vaccine. Can be delivered by numerous vehicles commonly used to deliver vaccines (MVA, Adenovirus, long synthetic peptides, BCG, and plasmid DNA). Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a vaccine sequence for a variety of SARS type viruses (mainly BetaCoronavirus, those that cause the deadliest form of infection). It is a genomic sequence of internal crucial viral proteins that are the most conserved and functionally important regions of the SARS virus. The vaccine targets these proteins as vulnerable parts of the virus and is capable of inducing T cell responses to them. This means that if a new mutation in SARS-CoV-2 alters the effectiveness of an antibody-based vaccine, the conserved T cell approach may protect from a resurgence of the virus. We have shown that this first, to our knowledge, pure T cell vaccine can protect against SARS-CoV-2 in the Golden Syrian Hamster Model. Because it targets all known variants of the virus we have begun to test its efficacy against by challenging with different strains. We are also beginning immunogenicity studies in the rhesus macaques to determine recapitulation in a possible human trial. We have funding from the Bisciotti Foundation to continue this work.",

    "ip_description": "The world emits about 43 billion tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) each year, and this number continues to rise annually. Increased CO2 contributed to the greenhouse effect, and, therefore, global warming, which damages Earth\u2019s climate and causes changes in weather patterns. The sequestration of CO2 is recognized as one of the most promising options for mitigating the increase of CO2 emissions, and many new technologies to allow for CO2 capture are being developed. The most popular capture process is based on chemical absorption in which a chemical absorbent combines with CO2 through acid-base interaction to achieve direct air capture. However, most state-of-the-art processes require heat energy, often achieved through a device driven by fossil energy, which generates additional CO2 emissions, making these processes high cost and low efficiency. Thus, there is a need for a method of CO2 capture that is inexpensive, efficient, and environmental friendly. Johns Hopkins inventors have created an innovative electrochemical system which can be implemented in CO2 capture and stores electrical energy simultaneously. The system consists of a membrane reactor which allows for the creation and separation of hydrogen gas and caustic soda. The caustic soda will react with the CO2 source, allowing for the absorption of CO2 and generation of a sodium carbonate solution. The hydrogen can be stored as electricity and when needed, can be used for electrical energy output. This energy output can partially compensate for the energy of the system and also releases a neutralizer for the reaction while the reactor of the system reacts with the sodium carbonate to release CO2 as pure gas. This system is diverse as it can be operated with various types of redox pairs and is based on low-cost general chemicals and room temperature reaction equipment. Thus, it can be easily employed in existing industrial environments and be directly connected to various existing renewable power generation equipment.",

    "ip_description": "Solar energy is the fastest-growing energy source and is projected to increase from its current 11% of total U.S. renewable generation to 48% by 2050. Solar concentrators are an innovation that can be used in conjunction with high-efficiency solar cells to facilitate this rapid increase in power generation. Concentrators like the Dielectric Total-Internal-Reflection concentrators (DTIRCs) direct light from over a large area to create a more efficient optical emitter into photovoltaic cells. However, current concentrators are limited by their specificity such that their efficacy reduces significantly outside of a small angular range. Consequently, an extremal system is typically required to track sun movement and adjust the concentrator, resulting in added cost and weight. Therefore, a new method of maintaining concentrator efficacy while reducing external additions is needed. Inventors at Johns Hopkins have developed an improved design based on the current DTIRCs. By implementing a Fresnel-lens like microstructure on the surface of the concentrator, they have been able to simultaneously increase the acceptance angle (from 22.5\u00b0 to 27\u00b0) and enhance the concentration ratio (from ~10 to ~11). These increases reduce the necessity for external equipment for tracking and adjustment, thereby making them flexible and customizable for various photovoltaic devices. A preliminary version of the system has been tested. Work is currently being done for further enhancement through optimization of ray incident direction through testing with ray optic simulations and manufacturing of the device via 3D printing technologies.",

Consequently, the detection of aneuploidy in clinical samples has important applications in prenatal testing and cancer diagnostics. The current, noninvasive methods for detecting aneuploidy in clinical samples rely upon next generation sequencing (NGS) protocols, such as whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing. However, these approaches are expensive and may not provide the depth of coverage needed to identify aneuploidy when low amounts of cell-free DNA are available. Consequently, improved methods of detecting aneuploidy would have numerous applications in diagnostics and forensics. JHU researchers have developed a rapid and sensitive genome sequencing method to identify aneuploidy in plasma samples. This test, called Real-SeqS, is an amplicon-based protocol that requires only a single primer pair to detect aneuploidy. This NGS protocol is advantageous compared to existing methods because it requires small volumes of clinical samples and provides a higher depth of coverage. The inventors paired this method with the use of a robust algorithm that they have developed specifically for amplicon-based aneuploidy detection. The inventors characterized the performance of this assay on a test cohort of 1155 healthy (euploid) and 809 cancer plasma samples. The cancer plasma samples included patients with breast, colorectal, esophageal, liver, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, and stomach cancers in stages I, II, and III. The inventors were able to detect aneuploidy in 23% of the plasma samples from cancer patients. The inventors have validated the Real-SeqS method using a test cohort of healthy (euploid) and cancer patient samples.",

However, the prevalence is dependent on the type of patients. For example, among ventilated burn patients, the prevalence is 77%, and among mechanically ventilated patients, the prevalence is 83%. Delirium in ICU patients is also associated with increased duration of mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospitalization, increased rate of self-extubation, and increased risk of mortality.

Diagnostics tools that utilize next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are often performed to identify gene rearrangements that are indicative of blood cancers, a practice that is expected to become more routine due to the lower cost of sequencing and the precision that the method offers. As such, the global market for diagnosing blood cancers is the fastest growing area, as compared to the diagnosis of other types of cancers using NGS technologies, and is expected to grow from $135.7 million in 2019 to $595.2 at a 32.4% CAGR (see BCC Research). However, the process of analyzing NGS data and generating an actionable diagnostic decision remains a major barrier to the adoption of NGS-based blood cancer diagnostics due to its complexity and lack of standardization. Therefore, there is a strong need for automated tools that simplify the process of analyzing NGS data to inform the diagnosis of blood cancers. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a web-based software tool that screens large next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets to identify clonal B- and T-cell populations. The tool is particularly useful in a diagnostic setting, whereby the overwhelming presence of a clonal population indicates the presence of blood cancers.

While required for many diagnoses and monitoring of disease symptoms, such as in Parkinson\u2019s disease, it is critical for human gait analysis to become more accessible as a diagnostic and symptom monitoring tool and further the health of patients. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University were able to utilize pose estimation, through OpenPose, a freely available human pose estimation algorithm, to accurately estimate human gait parameters utilizing two-dimensional digital video input. The software workflow enables quantitative, remote assessment of human movement using only simple videos recorded from household devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptop computers) with minimal costs of time, money, or effort. Additionally, the workflow approach is easy to use, fast, and accurate when compared to golden standards of three-dimensional motion capture. The end result is the ability for physicians to conduct more frequent, quantitative assessments of human motor function in any setting (e.g., directly in the home or clinic) without the requirement of specialized equipment or expertise operation. Currently, the inventors have focused on software development aimed at motor assessments for persons with Parkinson\u2019s disease or stroke. These individuals require motor assessments for symptom management. The team has successfully produced functional gait and repetitive movement, which have been validated against ground-truth measurements of human movement in healthy young adults. The next step in testing is external validation within patient populations.",

    "ip_description": "A cataract is a condition denoted by the blurring of the lens of the eye that accounts for 51% of blindness and 33% of visual impairments worldwide (see WHO). The number of people in the U.S. with cataracts is expected to double from 24.4 million in 2010 to a projected 50 million in 2050 (see NIH). Surgery is the only corrective treatment intervention for cataracts and is associated with a significantly lowered risk of death, hip fractures, or car accidents. Notably, the experience levels of surgeons play a significant role in the quality of cataract surgeries. Surgeons in their first year are nine times more likely to have high complication rates, versus surgeons in their tenth year. Each incremental year of surgical practice is associated with a 10% lower risk of adverse surgical events (see Ophthamology). Nevertheless, practicing surgeons have limited opportunities to receive critical feedback. Post-residency education is limited to sporadic one-on-one mentoring by experienced colleagues, a process that is inefficient to implement at the scale that is required to meet the needs of newly graduating surgeons. As such, there is a strong need for learning tools that accelerate improvements in cataract surgeries and, thereby, improve the quality of care for the millions of patients with cataracts. Inventors at Johns Hopkins have developed a machine learning-enabled platform called eyeLearn that allows surgeons to (1) watch back recordings of their procedure (full or in steps), (2) receive an automated, unbiased, and objective assessment of their skill for target steps, and (3) review pertinent examples with feedback on how to improve their performance. The eyeLearn platform aims to accelerate learning and skill acquisition for surgeons across the career spectrum \u2013 whether they are in training or in independent practice.",

    "ip_description": "A recent study by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society found that nearly one million people are living with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the most common immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease of the nervous system. Due to few disease-specific characteristic symptoms and the varied pace of disease progression from patient to patient, the disease surveillance strategy for patients can vary across medical teams. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer, has been proposed as a high resolution, noninvasive way to image the retina and detect progressive optic tract demyelination, which can occur after clinically apparent and subclinical optic neuritis (ON), a condition thought to be common in MS due to the primary neurodegenerative pathology. Currently, there is no suitable method for monitoring the disease progression of MS via the retinal thickness. This is an important biomarker which can assist clinicians in treatment and disease management. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed an iterative registration and deep learning based method for the longitudinal segmentation of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the retina. This method will allow for consistent monitoring of MS disease progression through comparisons of OCT scans taken at different times. Currently, the algorithm has been developed and tested, and is undergoing further improvements and refinement.",

    "ip_description": "Chronic pain affects about 100-million adults in the United States and is primarily treated with drugs, which can have significant negative side effects (NIH-Institute of Medicine). A promising alternative therapy is electrical peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) therapy. However, PNS therapy has been associated with suboptimal efficacy because the amount of stimulation to deliver is often uncertain and the current therapies are primarily open-loop (i.e. require manual adjustment of the stimulation parameters). Critical to advancing PNS treatment is a deeper understanding of pain processing, but the pain system is difficult to probe experimentally and analyze computationally. Mechanistic models of pain transmission have been developed to investigate the appropriate amount of stimulation necessary but the data from these models have proven difficult to analyze. There is a strong need for a computational method that quantifies pain and relays the proper amount of PNS to adequately alleviate the pain. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a closed-loop approach to control PNS in a manner that reduces amplified pain signals caused by injury or disease, while still maintaining normal pain processing capabilities. Closed-loop PNS therapies can automatically adapt based on the patient\u2019s current need to reduce pain transmission to the brain. Preclinical data is available.",

    "ip_description": "Heart failure is a continuously growing health issue in the United States. According to a study by the CDC, approximately 6.2 million Americans had heart failure between the years 2013-2016, and that number is expected to breach 8 million by 2030 (see AHA). Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), a potentially fatal cause of respiratory distress, specifically occurs in ~1% of people over the age of 55 (see Chang). Treatment of ADHF differs from that of chronic heart failure, focusing on immediate hemodynamic stabilization rather than long-term symptom management (see UptoDate). Such stabilization often includes administration of vasodilators to reduce cardiac load, however use of vasodilators can also lead to hypotension in some patients (see UptoDate). Inotropes, drugs that increase cardiac contractility, can sometimes be given to prevent hypotension, but many have toxicities related to cAMP signaling (see Sabbah). One promising way to overcome the complexities of ADHF treatment is to simultaneously vasodilate and increase cardiac contractility in a cAMP-independent manner, a goal accomplished by the nitroxyl donor Angelis\u2019 salt (see Paolocci). However, Angelis\u2019 salt degrades too rapidly under physiological conditions, thereby prohibiting its use as an ADHF therapeutic. Therefore, development of drugs that donate nitroxyl groups on a physiologically-relevant timescale could revolutionize the treatment of ADHF. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a class of nitroxyl donor compounds based on diazen-1-ium-1, 2-diolate derivatives. These compounds degrade at one sixth the rate of Angelis\u2019 salt, making the more relevant as potential treatments for ADHF.",

Therefore, cancer patients need a way to effectively manage pain through opioids without reducing their immune responses.

Through targeting and manipulation of the OPRM, ORPK, OPRD and OPRL genes, the impact on the T and NK cells can be reduced or eliminated, therefore reinstating the immune function of patients. This discovery is still in the early stage. Researchers have shown how the opioids impact the T and NK cells, and have identified some genes which can be targeted to reduce this impact.

    "ip_description": "Fuchs\u2019 endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a genetic disease affecting the cornea and is estimated to affect 7% of the adult population (see Aiello et al. 2022). The first genetic defect shown to cause FECD was a point mutation in the alpha 2 collagen 8 gene (Col8a2). The disease results in a buildup of fluid in the cornea and causes clouding and blurring of vision. Although a patient is born with the condition, it is not detectable or symptomatic until middle age or later. Early stage treatments can intervene in the progression of the disease using eyedrops or eye ointments, but the advanced stage often requires corneal transplant surgery. Current therapies also cannot reverse disease progression. Therefore, there is a strong need to further understand the disease and develop more treatments to halt and possibly reverse disease progression. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a Col8a2 knock-in mouse model that contains a point mutation known to cause early onset Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy. The inventors introduced a mutation from glutamine to lysine at the 455 position to replicate a known human mutation in the mice. The result is a mouse line that develops a highly similar corneal disease to the human disease FECD. The mouse line provides an opportunity to study the pathobiology of disease and potential treatments to help individuals affected.",

While urinary biomarkers have demonstrated promise, there are no FDA-approved biomarkers that can non-invasively differentiate between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancer, with currently available biomarkers having poor discrimination power towards aggressive prostate cancer. As a result, patients with non-aggressive prostate cancer are subjected to unnecessary biopsies. There is therefore an unmet clinical need to discover novel biomarkers that can be used to differentiate between nonaggressive and aggressive prostate cancer. Researchers at Johns Hopkins, using high-throughput automated urine sample preparation and data independent acquisition mass spectrometry, have identified novel panels of urinary glycoproteins that are capable of differentiating between non-aggressive and aggressive prostate cancer. These noninvasive tests are reliable, of good predictive capability, and could reduce unnecessary biopsies.

    "ip_description": "According to the WHO, excessive exposure to the sun can lead to cancer, cataracts, other eye diseases as well as visual ageing (WHO). The skin is the ultimate barrier that humans interface with the environment. Unfortunately, the environment we live in is becoming progressively more hostile to our health. Air pollutants (eg., ozone, particulate matters), solar radiation, viruses (eg., Variola), microbes (eg., Bacillus anthracis, Borrelia species) and certain disease transmission vectors (eg., mosquitos, ticks), and nuclear radiation are just a handful of noxious elements that threaten the health of humans. Despite this growing list, conventional skin protectants such as sunscreens and bug spray repellants have clear limitations. Upon application to the skin, the media evaporates, leaving behind a layer of non-connected, unbound compounds that can be washed, perspired, or rubbed off. This leads to potential absorption by the body, and/or release into the environment. In addition, these materials require periodic re-application for sustained protection. For public health and environmental reasons there is a dire need for a novel skin protective barrier platform that maintains versatile protection while remaining safe and does not require periodic re-application. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel skin protective barrier platform that can be customized to block, trap, neutralize and/or delay the penetration of these elements to viable human skin. This technology involves a media that is composed of a film forming polymer matrix that is formed directly on the skin surface by chemical reaction of its constituents. The film does not wash off from the skin, yet is breathable, by virtue of its high oxygen and water vapor permeability. This technology is versatile and can be generally extended to other applications for films that block portions of the visible light spectrum, chemicals, pollutants, viruses, microbes, and their transmission vectors from reaching the skin would be useful. Both \u201cfunctionalized\u201d and \u201cnon-functionalized\u201d films can be used as physical barriers to these assailants. Appropriately \u201cfunctionalized\u201d films can be made via analogous chemical approaches, but directed against other agents. For example, films containing bound insect repellants, such as DEET, can be made to ward off insect bites. Binding the repellant molecules within the film structure will prevent their leaching into the body, and the environment, and will alleviate the need to reapplication, providing much needed benefits over the existing technology.",

    "ip_description": "A large proportion of patients with bleeding disorders fail to be diagnosed, and are classified as having bleeding of unknown cause due to a lack of sensitive assays for detecting abnormalities in fibrinolytic factors (Mehic et al. 2021). In addition, patients with young-onset or unprovoked venous thromboembolism, as well as those with young-onset or cryptogenic ischemic stroke, often have a non-informative or unrevealing routine clinical laboratory workup for hypercoagulable states and may warrant evaluation of plasma fibrinolytic function of hypofibrinolytic states. The euglobulin clot lysis assay (ECLA) is currently used, but is slow, labor intensive, and has low sensitivity. Thus, there exists a strong need for developing a new assay that is high throughput, sensitive, and replicable to address the limitations of current ECLA. Current methods for detecting fibrinolytic factor abnormalities see limited clinical use due to low sensitivity and high labor and time costs. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a high throughput, mini-scale ECLA assay to address these shortcomings. The method involves a series of semi-automated acidification, centrifugation, and wash steps followed by resuspension of the resulting euglobulin fraction pellet and measurement of lysis times through spectrophotometry. Data demonstrates comparable or greater sensitivities than standard ECLA at lower sample volumes and higher throughput. In vitro trials are ongoing and demonstrate preliminary analytic sensitivity while allowing for significant sample preservation, greater automation, and higher throughput. Current efforts focus on characterizing reproducibility and sensitivity, decreasing running times, and developing companion software.",

It is characterized clinically by motor dysfunction that is due to the preferential loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Current treatment strategies for PD are mainly limited to the management of the motor symptoms with drugs such as L-DOPA or dopamine receptor agonists and deep brain stimulation. However, current therapies are insufficient and have not been proven to delay or prevent the onset or progression of PD. JHU inventors have expertise in the key players such as PARIS and mechanisms behind Parkinson\u2019s disease. Post-translational modification of PARIS prevents its ability to bind chromatin and inhibit gene transcription. A high throughput screen identified a known compound that activate a key promoter in the presence of PARIS. It was selected for further characterization based on properties suggesting it could be an orally bioavailable and brain permeable compound that could modify the levels of players in PD pathology.

Most anti-viral treatment strategies to date are limited in scope to the virus of interest and often result in drug resistance, incomplete efficacy, and/or toxicity. Costs for viral specific targets can be massive and take years to develop. Therefore, there is an urgent need for broad, effective and safe anti-viral treatments that can attenuate virus infectivity or pathogenesis.\n\nTechnical Details: Researchers have developed a novel strategy for expansively treating viral infections through inhibition of infectivity using azide-modified biomolecules. Biomolecules include fatty acids, carbohydrates and lipids that are involved in post-translational modifications for many viruses, allowing for the technology\u2019s broad use. As shown in vitro, azide-modified lipids incorporated post-translationally on proteins of human HIV-1 or insect baculovirus led to decreased infectivity of both viruses compared to unlabeled controls. Azide-modified fatty acids can be added simply as a dietary source and are orally bioavailable requiring no specialized delivery. In addition, modified biomolecules can be used to label viral proteins in vivo to monitor viral infectivity. Finally, altering modification from an azide to alkyne group has shown the opposite effect of increasing infectivity as a strategy to aid propagation of viral stocks for vaccine development or vector delivery.\n\nValue Proposition: \n\n\u00b7      Novel anti-viral treatment strategy targeting common viral process of post-translational modification\n\u00b7      Azide-modified biomolecules decrease infectivity in broad range of viruses\n\u00b7      Treatment can be administered alongside currently accepted antiviral drugs for increased efficacy\n\nLooking for Partners to: Develop & commercialize the technology as a novel anti-viral treatment strategy.\n\nStage of Development: Pre-Clinical \n\nData Availability: In vitro",

    "ip_description": "Needle guided procedures like catheterizations and biopsies are important medical tools to diagnose and treat disease. In the US alone, over 2.7 million catheterization procedures and over 3 million breast cancer biopsies are performed every year (see iData and CST). Real time imaging of biopsy needles is a technique used by physicians to help precisely guide the needle directly to the target area. Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for needle tracking because of its portability, low cost, and absence of ionizing radiation (see GS). However, ultrasound guided surgeries are often not viable options in acoustically challenging environments like transcranial, abdominal, and spinal surgeries because of acoustic scattering and attenuation of signal. In these environments, acoustic artifacts are difficult for the image segmentation software to interpret which results in unreliable images. Therefore, there is a strong need for improved ultrasound image resolution and segmentation models to be developed to address the inability to use ultrasound imaging to track needles in acoustically challenging environments. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a real-time autonomous photoacoustic needle tracking system to precisely track needle and catheter tips during surgical procedures. Two image segmentation techniques are available for the system to identify the target from the imaging data. In the first technique, a human-interpretable image is reconstructed using traditional beamforming algorithms and the target is segmented from the beamformed image. This technique allows for target position estimates to be provided to human operators within the context of surrounding tissue in the beamformed images. In the second technique, a deep learning image segmentation software interprets and segments the imaging data to obtain the target position with a focus on target tracking via robotic visual servoing. Specifically, a convolutional neural network is used to identify and localize photoacoustic targets formed by needle and catheter tips in tissue while filtering out artifacts. This dual-mode approach can be extended to a variety of applications involving photoacoustic-guided surgical procedures.",

    "ip_description": "Polymeric and lipid nanoparticles (NPs) are an effective and safe method for therapeutic delivery. At each of the various steps in nanoparticle development and manufacturing (i.e., research and design, quality assurance), assessing the features of these vehicles is essential. Some features (i.e., packaging characteristics, cargo location, structure assembly, and dynamic behavior during purification) provide important insights that can further the understanding of structure-property function and the optimization of NP design. However, payload distribution and capacity - key characteristics that inform pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and delivery efficiency \u2013 are difficult to characterize at the single NP level with current methods. Therefore, there is a clear need for new methods that improve the assessment of NP payloads, particularly at the single NP level.\n\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed a multi-laser cylindrical illumination confocal microscopy (CICS) technique that can assess cargo and carrier content of delivery vehicles at single-NP level. The technique features in-line examination in a flow set-up, 100% mass detection efficiency and single-cargo sensitivity. When multiple fluorescent tags are used, it differentiates distinct populations within a formulation (e.g., free mRNA, mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles, and empty lipid nanoparticles), and then quantitatively resolve single-cargo/carrier fluorescence to give a distribution of single-NP payload level. In addition, the method can be coupled with hydrodynamic separation to resolve coupled data of size (diameter) and payload of the same NP, which provides unprecedented level of details for investigation of NP assembly mechanisms.\n\nProof of concept work has been completed and demonstrated for mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs, published as a research article in Nature Communications), in which the distribution of mRNA copy per LNP was successfully characterized for multiple formulations, with populations of empty (unloaded) LNPs identified. We are working with more collaborators to apply the technique to analyze different cargos, including proteins, small molecule drugs, and other nucleic acids in diverse NP systems including PLGA NPs, exosomes, and extracellular vehicles (EVs). We are seeking for more collaborators with interest in characterizing single-NP payloads.",

Inventors at Johns Hopkins have developed bio-fidelic phantoms of specific patients\u2019 cancers. The specificity of the anatomical location and orientation is achieved via segmentation of CT/MRI scans and subsequent transference of the contours to 3D printers. Varying ratios of polymer blend are used to mimic the modulus of tissues involved in the model. Additionally, ultrasound imaging of the model is near indistinguishable from real tissue through incorporation of glass microbeads into the formulation.

    "ip_description": "A large number of cancers, including glioblastoma (GBM), lack effective treatment due to inaccessibility of the primary tumor to pharmaceutical interventions. GBM is highly malignant, leading to 5-year survival rates below 10%. The inability to treat GBM tumors effectively is largely due to the blood brain barrier (BBB). Common approaches to increase drug loading at the site of the tumor rely on nanoparticle formulations, but these delivery mechanisms still result in subclinical levels of drug at the intended site. Thus, there is a large unmet need for mechanisms that improve drug delivery to the site of GBM and other brain cancers. The investigators have described a mechanism to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs using single stranded DNA (ssDNA) nanotubes. The engineered nanotubes have been demonstrated to cross the BBB and reach the target GBM tissue following systemic injection in mice. Furthermore, the concentration of nanoparticles present in the tumor 24 hours following administration is up to 10 times higher than that for other nanoparticle formulations in development. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that they bind to and are internalized by glioma cells, but not healthy astrocyte cells. The nanotubes have shown a robust safety profile in mouse studies. The described studies in vitro and in mice reveal that these nanotubes are an attractive vehicle for delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to GBM tumors. Additionally, this technology could potentially be applied to other tumor types where drug loading at the tumor site is a major barrier to pharmaceutical treatment. The investigators have characterized these nanotubes in vitro, and have performed in vivo studies in a mouse model of brain cancer.",

It may not be the procedure of choice for late-stage cataracts often found in underserved populations. Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS) does not require capital equipment or high initial expenditures, is more time- and cost-efficient than phacoemulsification, and can treat mature cataracts.

Measuring expression levels of a panel of type I and type II IFN signaling-induced proteins in submandibular gland and muscle tissues correlates with the presence of autoimmune diseases. Immunohistochemical data show upregulated, with respect to healthy controls, levels of IFN signaling-induced proteins in samples collected from patients with autoimmune diseases. The assay effectively detects differing and patient-specific levels of type I and type II IFN activity across samples from patients with autoimmune diseases. Novel method to detect IFN signaling activity to diagnose autoimmune diseases. Simple and quantitative method of detection that requires small amount of sample tissue.

The inventor proposed that COVID-19 causes endothelial injury, leading to microvascular inflammation and microvascular thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. As P-selectin mediates the initial rolling of leukocytes onto the inflamed endothelium and activates monocytes to synthesize tissue factor, an essential cofactor in the initiation of the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, the inventor proposed that a P-selectin inhibitor will decrease vascular inflammation and vascular thrombosis in COVID-19 patients and improve their treatment outcomes. Several recent publications on COVID-19 associated coagulopathy have supported P-selectin as a potential therapeutic target. The inventor has completed a clinical trial with Novartis (NCT04435184) to test crizanlizumab\u2019s safety and efficacy in improving outcomes of COVID-19 patients. We tested the effect of P-selectin inhibition on biomarkers of thrombosis and inflammation in patients with COVID-19. Hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or crizanlizumab, a P-selectin inhibitor, in a double-blind fashion. Crizanlizumab reduced P-selectin levels by 89%. Crizanlizumab increased D-dimer levels by 77% and decreased prothrombin fragment. There were no significant differences between crizanlizumab and placebo for clinical endpoints. Crizanlizumab was well tolerated. Crizanlizumab may induce thrombolysis in the setting of COVID-19.",

    "ip_description": "To mitigate the spread of infectious diseases, rapid and widely available testing methods are needed to screen immunity at the population scale. Current antibody quantification assays often require lab-based instrumentation and methodology that can only be used/followed by skilled personnel. Unfortunately, at-home tests are not broadly available and are limited in their quantitative detection capabilities. There is thus an unmet need for a point of care diagnostic test for detection and monitoring of infectious disease immunity. Johns Hopkins researchers developed a glucometer-based immunoassay as a point of care diagnostic for infectious disease antibodies. Researchers created a recombinant fusion protein consisting of an anti-human immunoglobulin G (IgG) symmetrically linked to two enzymes that detects serum antibodies and quantifies their presence through a readout that is detectable by commercial glucometers. Successful proof-of-concept measurements demonstrated detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies in blinded clinical training sets with sensitivity comparable to gold standard commercial ELISA-based detection methods. The results of this study indicate that the immunoassay can deliver accurate readouts of serum antibody levels. This information can be useful in monitoring the spread of and protection against infectious diseases, and can be used to guide public health and vaccination measures. Quick and quantitative diagnostic immunoassay using a human antibody fusion protein. Detects serum-circulating antibodies specific to a broad array of antigenic polypeptides.

These include impairment of renal function, hypertension, and lymphatic malignancies. There is therefore a need for a locally administered immunosuppressant which reduces drug associated toxicity from systematic distributions. A peptide hydrogel containing an immunosuppressive small molecule drug in crystalized form has been developed. The crystalized drug is dispersed throughout the hydrogel, allowing for sustained delivery to a targeted area. The hydrogel is injected to the adjacent or surrounding the therapeutically relevant area using a syringe. In a study example, the immunosuppressant tofacitinib, was loaded into the peptide hydrogels and studied in an in-vivo heterotrophic heat transplant mouse model. In combination with a common immunosuppressant, CTLA4-Ig, the drug loaded peptide hydrogel improved survival times threefold.

However, current spinning bioreactors available on the market (e.g. the Corning\u00ae disposable spinner flasks) have several major challenges including requiring a large volume of medium and incubator space, large sample-to-sample variability associated with current methods, and the limitation of tissue heterogeneity. There is a critical need to develop an organoid platform with reduced cost, higher throughput, and increased reproducibility and one that better resembles critical aspects of human cortical development. The JHU inventors have engineered a miniaturized spinning bioreactor using 3D design and printing technology and developed a protocol to generate forebrain-specific organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which recapitulate human embryonic cortical development in a reproducible and quantifiable manner. The inventors also developed protocols for midbrain and hypothalamic organoids. The versatile, simple-to-use, cost-effective, and reproducible brain-region-specific organoid platform provides accessible and affordable technology to a broad scientific community. The JHU inventors have developed and optimized the design of the miniaturized spinning bioreactor that requires as little as 2 ml of media per well, a 50-fold reduction in media consumption, has drastically reduced incubator space, and can be stackable. For proof of concept, the inventors employed the forebrain organoid quantitative platform developed using the Spin\u03a9 to model Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure at different stages of pregnancy. The results suggest that ZIKV, upon access to the fetal brain, targets neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and causes microcephalic-like deficits in cortical development.",

    "ip_description": "Loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is defined as a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B virus infection, but it is clinically challenged by the derivation of HBsAg from two sources that must be uniquely targeted: covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and integrated HBV DNA (iDNA). Currently, no rapid method exists to distinguish the sources of HBsAg in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). There is critical need for a method to rapidly and accurately identify the source of the HBsAg from liver tissue to help clinicians or clinical trial designers to subtype patients and choose appropriate therapeutics to maximize the likelihood of HBsAg loss. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a method to identify the source(s) of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) from liver tissue. The method consists of a sensitive and specific multiplex droplet digital PCR that characterizes the relative amounts of HBsAg that derive from cccDNA and/or iDNA, as indicators of responsiveness to treatments and patient outcome. Proof-of-concept studies using liver tissues from patients infected with hepatitis B, demonstrated a patient-specific enrichment of cccDNA or iDNA-derived transcripts. This evidence strongly supports that the technology can be used to stratify patients based on their predominant source of HBsAg. Value Proposition: \u00b7 Simple and quantitative method to identify the source of HBsAg \u00b7 Requires small amounts of liver tissue from liver biopsy \u00b7 Specific and precise distinction between cccDNA and iDNA derived HBsAg \u00b7 Permits subtype specific and appropriate therapeutic selection from emerging therapeutics.",

    "ip_description": "A medical device that utilizes transmission ultrasonography to enable ultrasound-guided placement of central venous catheters. Central venous catheters in children are typically placed with the use of fluoroscopy, which emits potentially harmful ionizing radiation. Ultrasound has the potential of permitting safe real-time guidance, but, until now, ultrasound-assisted catheter systems have not permitted adequate visualization with standard handheld ultrasound probes. A group of clinicians and engineers at Johns Hopkins have developed a novel method to enable ultrasound-guidance of central venous catheters. Advantages of this technology include: a catheter placement system that gives accurate anatomical detail of the location of the probe for ultrasound-guided placement of central venous catheters, an ideal therapeutic procedure for pediatric patients due to little to no ionizing radiation, and more convenient and portable equipment than fluoroscopy. To reduce complications and harmful exposure to non-ionizing radiation, the medical field needs advances that improve central venous access procedures, such as PICC lines, tunneled central lines, and dialysis catheters. Ultrasound (US) can be used for planning access, guiding insertion, and identifying complications of these catheters. US is recommended over landmark techniques because it reduces risk of complications, shortens the time to successful cannulation, and reduces overall costs. Basic, hand-held ultrasound machines with Brightness-mode and Doppler mode are commonly used for the procedure. However, even when US is used for venipuncture, ionizing radiography and fluoroscopy are typically used for wire navigation and catheter tip confirmation. Johns Hopkins researchers developed an intravascular probe that can accurately register and display intrathoracic instrumentation. The patented intravascular system will work with any commercially available US system, limiting the need for capital investment. Together these two devices provide the location of the probe and catheter as well as the associated graphical representation of vascular anatomy. The resulting real-time and accurate location monitoring of the catheter within the existing anatomical environment can be overlaid onto traditional B-mode or Doppler representations. These beneficial details can improve a common clinical procedure and prevent today\u2019s numerous complications which include bleeding, puncture, duct injury, infection, catheter migration, embolization, myocardial perforation, and nerve injury. Most importantly, the advanced and reliable insight provided by the probe eliminates the existing need for ionizing radiation to confirm catheter placement.",

Olfactory receptors are difficult to express in cell systems from which they are not derived. The ORs tend to remain intracellular in such systems, and use of these systems to identify ligands/odorants that interact with them or understand how they function is difficult. The present invention addresses these limitations. It involves the use of a cleavable signal peptide (\u2018Lucy\u2019) that ensures ORs expressed within the cell, are trafficked to the cell surface and retain their functional ability to bind to target molecules. Other advantages include: Enhanced and stable trafficking of OR to the cell surface. \u2018Lucy\u2019 tag cleaved prior to expression of the OR on the cell surface, thereby not interfering with its function. Can be combined with any OR or any protein that has to be expressed on the cell surface. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a method and composition that ensures cell surface expression of Olfactory Receptors in heterologous cellular systems. This involved the creation of a fusion protein consisting of a \u2018Lucy\u2019 tag linked to the specific OR. This tag is a signal peptide sequence that ensures transport of the OR out from the intracellular space, and expression on the cell surface where it can bind and detect odorants. The tag is cleaved from the fusion protein prior to expression of the OR on the cell surface. This feature ensures that the functionality of the OR is retained once it reaches the cell surface.",

    "ip_description": "DNA Double-strand breaks (DSB) occur when it is exposed to ionizing radiation and can result in cancerous mutations when repaired via homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Cancer cells rely on these mutagenic repair mechanisms for survival. But, the dynamics between the two repair pathways is unclear. DNA repair machinery is complex as there are a large number of proteins involved in the process and alterations in repair machinery and pathways can indicate sensitivity to therapeutic agents such such as PARP inhibitors, cisplatin, and immunotherapy. Therefore, functional assays to measure rates of HR and NHEJ are of significant interest for facilitating drug discovery. Several methods have been developed to measure rates of HR or NHEJ; however, most require the use of multiple tools to fully assess rates of repair by each pathway individually using multiple samples. Therefore, there is a need to assess the relationship between the HR and NHEJ pathway, as well as the functional impact of DNA repair mutations on rates of repair in order to develop research tools and pathway-specific therapies. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed the RepairSwitch assay, the first flow cytometric assay to simultaneously detect the rates of HR or NHEJ mediated repair of Cas9 induced DSBs using a novel fluorescence switching reporter system. The assay exhibits low background signal and is capable of detecting rare repair events in the 1 in 10,000 range. The utility of the RepairSwitch has been assessed by measuring the potency of inhibitors targeting ATM, DNA-PK, and PARP, which modulate DSB repair rates in HEK293FT cells. The value of this technology is the ability to simultaneously detect the type of DNA repair pathway (HR, NHEJ, or both) in the setting of new drug discovery and genetic perturbations that will show synthetic lethality with existing therapeutic agents. All constructs and processes have been developed. Next steps include packaging into a kit and scaling to market.",

One particular component of cardiac surgery\u2014temporary epicardial pacing wires\u2014exist to provide temporary pacing is to reestablish normal hemodynamics that are acutely compromised by a slow or fast heart rate. Temporary pacing can also be used prophylactically when the need for pacing is anticipated, and can be can be lifesaving (Estes, 2020). However, removal of temporary epicardial pacing wires (TEPW) in the postoperative period can lead to serious bleeding necessitating surgical intervention and conferring high morbidity (Cote et al., 2020). Therefore, there is a strong need for the development of innovative mechanisms to improve safety and patient outcomes related to the removal of epicardial pacing wires. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have conceptualized the possibility for the atraumatic release of epicardial pacing wires, placed following cardiac surgery. This technology would present immense implications; researchers proposes two means of achieving an atraumatic release of epicardial pacing wires.

Therefore, there is a clear need for long-acting prodrugs that can produce sustained release of RSSH over longer time periods to promote cytoprotective activity. Johns Hopkins investigators report that a class of chemicals referred to herein as Alkylamine-Substituted Perthiocarbamates (ASP) act as precursors for the generation of RSSH and COS. The ASP molecules can be tuned appropriately to mediate generation of RSSH and COS over a range of half-lives. Moreover, the described molecules could act as prodrugs and mediate activity in response to external stimuli. The investigators have probed the role of RSSH release, mediated by ASP treatment, in protection of cardiomyocytes in the setting of oxidative stress. In vitro, the administration of ASPs maintains cell viability in the setting of oxidative stress. Furthermore, ASPs show attenuation of injury in a mouse model of myocardial ischemia. Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of prodrug-driven sustained RSSH release and potential downstream cytoprotective benefits in the setting of oxidative stress.",

    "ip_description": "AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are crucial molecules to study to understand the function the nervous system. These receptors mediate the majority of fast excitatory activities in the mammalian brain, and their regulation is regarded as a key mechanism underlying long-lasting changes that give rise to learning and memory. Elucidating how synaptic molecules such as AMPA receptors mediate neuronal communication and tracking them during behavior is crucial to understand cognition and disease, but current technological barriers exist that limit the ability to visualize such proteins in mouse models. Modern proteomic and transcriptomic methods provide biologists with myriad candidate proteins, but in many cases, there are no tools (e.g. monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies) available to effectively study these targets. One alternative approach that addresses this challenge is to fluorescently tag proteins to visualize them in living tissue. There is a strong need for a new genetic labeling strategy that allows direct visualization of endogenous AMPAR expression in a manner that does not impair synaptic function, plasticity, or behavior and enables further understanding of cognition and disease. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a SEP-GluA1 knockin mouse model that enables the robust visualization of excitatory synapses throughout the brain. This knockin mouse line contains an AMPAR GluA1 subunit tagged with super ecliptic pHluorin (SEP), a pH-sensitive variant of GFP that fluoresces at neutral pH and is quenched at acidic pH. When coupled to the extracellular N-terminal domain of the AMPAR, this SEP tag reports the concentration of functional receptors at the cell surface, as the fluorescence of receptors localized in acidic, internal compartments such as endosomes and Golgi is quenched. This genetic labeling strategy also avoids confounders arising from manipulation of the AMPAR C-terminus, a region important for proper function and trafficking to the postsynaptic membrane. These SEP-GluA1 knockin mouse models used in conjunction with in vivo 2 photon microscopy, enables longitudinal tracking of synaptic plasticity underlying behavior at brain-wide scale with single-synapse resolution.",

    "ip_description": "Tissue engineering is a developing technology that has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of many types of injuries. It focuses combining cells and 3D scaffolds to restore, maintain, or improve damaged tissues or whole organs. In tissue, specifically, mechanical forces have epigenetic control of developmental, remodeling, and regeneration processes. One way to create mechanical forces in tissue is magnetic actuation, which uses magnetic forces to deform the plasma membrane, causing changes in actomyosin tension levels, and promoting cytoskeleton reorganization. This can improve cell seeding efficacies, and invasion into 3D scaffolds or even enable a scaffold-free approach that bypasses any potential inflammatory response to the scaffold or its degradation product. However, traditional bioreactor systems that generate these mechanical forces in tissue are complex and use centimeter-scaled tissue samples, creating a limit to uniformly delivering nutrients and drugs to the tissue as a whole and optically observing the image of the tissue due to its high thickness. The bioreactor systems that use conventional optical imaging based on a microscope have difficulty scanning for simultaneously monitoring multiple tissues. In addition, the bioreactor systems that can provide only the tensile force of tissue using external magnetic fields have a limit to simulating various types of forces occurring in tissues in vivo, such as torsional and tensile forces acting on the skeletal muscle and the heart tissues. Thus, there is a strong need for an improved method of stimulating small-sized tissue for emulating mechanical behavior of in vivo tissue, optimal drug delivery, and high throughput. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a magnetic actuation system capable of stimulating the maturing engineered tissue. It comprises of a multiple posts array for tissue formation and actuation, an optical or magnetic-based monitoring unit for tissue observation, and a magnetic field forming unit for stimulating the tissue. It was observed that engineered tissue formed on the post array was successfully stretched and twisted by actuation motions that induced tensile and torsional forces of the post, which is magnetized by the magnetic field. It can also be a medium- and high-throughput system by applying the same magnetic field to a plurality of posts arrays and simultaneously monitoring the mechanical behavior of the tissue during magnetic actuation.",

However, the subtraction assumes that no motion has occurred between the two images, while in fact, voluntary and involuntary motion is common between acquisitions. This results in artifacts in the DSA images that diminish the visibility of the vasculature and may require multiple takes. Therefore, there is a need for a method to reduce motion-induced artifacts in DSAs. Inventors at Johns Hopkins have developed a method called 2D motion compensation (2D MoCo) for reduction of motion artifacts in 2D DSA. For the non-contrast image, this novel method employs a 3-dimensional image of the patient instead, from which a 2D image is generated via 3D2D image registration.

To maximize safety and minimize reactogenicity, vaccine development is gradually shifting from whole, inactivated vaccines to well defined subunit vaccines. However, this approach often suffers from reduced immunogenicity. To address this, adjuvants are used to enhance the immune response to an antigen. Aluminum salts (alum) are the most widely used adjuvants, yet they lack utility for vaccine targets requiring cellular immunity due to poor stimulation of CD8 T cells and poor immune memory. Therefore, there is a need for aluminum adjuvants that can generate cellular immunity and be used for numerous targets, including cancer and infectious diseases. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed small, stabilized aluminum nanoparticles using a flash nanocomplexation (FNC) method that can be utilized for vaccines. The FNC platform produces small, uniform alum NPs, and encapsulates protein or peptide antigens with alum NPs in a scalable and reproducible manner, allowing for subsequent modifications of the alum NP, including coatings and surface modifications. The NPs showed superior dendritic cell activation relative to industry aluminum adjuvant controls, and has promise as a Th1 adjuvant. Therefore, these aluminum adjuvant NPs can be used to induce cellular immunity, broadening the applicability of this adjuvant to cancer and other indications that still need vaccine adjuvants.

One of the most attractive features of surgical robotics is the ability to integrate preoperative and intra-operative images to provide more information for surgical planning and navigation. Specifically, for surgical navigation, or intraoperative surgical guidance, it is important to register the medical images so that corresponding points between the patient anatomy and images (e.g., CT scan) are aligned. However, current methods are only capable of registering a single rigid body. Thus, there is a need for a new method of image registration for multiple bodies, which will allow surgical navigation to be used for procedures like the reduction of multiple bone fragments. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel registration framework for registering multiple structures between volumetric (3D) and projection (2D) images using an adaptive template. In the example of image guided fracture reduction for pelvic trauma, the transformations of multiple bone fragments needed to restore bone morphology are computed preoperatively, and used to guide the reduction of the fragments using 3D-2D registration with respect to fluoroscopy and the preoperative CT. This method has been tested in simulation, phantom studies, and initial clinical studies, successfully demonstrating registration accuracy consistent with clinical requirements. This technology has broad implications for the surgical robotics field, allowing for the registration of fractured bone fragments, the registration of anatomy with multiple structures, like the spine, and registration of anatomical structures along with devices like surgical instruments.",

Furthermore, current imaging technologies are not sensitive to iodine, so high concentrations are needed, which can be dangerous especially in patients with compromised kidney functions in the event of repeated administration. Alternatively, dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) is a technique that uses two separate x-ray photon energy spectra in order to allow the reconstruction of different images based on varying attenuation properties at different energies. Specifically, it can visualize iodine at lower concentrations, and may provide a more sensitive method of measuring tumor shape, size, and vasculature. Although it potentially addresses the limitations of CT imaging, DECT suffers from bias and large variability in iodine quantitation due to varying patient habitus, imaging protocol, and scanner specifications, in which the effects are especially severe for pediatric and obese patients. Thus, there is a need for a method of decreasing the bias in iodine quantitation in order to use dual-energy systems for oncological imaging. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a method of controlling and minimizing the sources of bias in DECT. First, they have established an end-to-end, patient-specific model for designing dual-energy systems and protocols that are robust against bias by developing a theoretical framework that relates various system parameters to iodine quantitation accuracy and variability. Then, they combined it with an artificial intelligence approach to remove residual bias, by identifying optimal dual-energy acquisition protocols and developing a decomposition algorithm using artificial intelligence-based image reconstruction. Not only does this technology have the potential to optimize the imaging pipeline for integration into oncological imaging, but it also enables the introduction of an iodine biomarker for therapeutic assessment of focal lesions, significantly improving upon the traditional size-dependent measure of treatment efficacy.",

All CT scans employ \u201cback-projection\u201d as the basic computational method to relate 2D detector signal values into a 3D re-construction. However, image reconstruction sometimes leads to noise and artifacts in the image and alternative methods for reconstruction have caused major increase in computational burden. Thus, there is a need for a 3D image reconstruction method for CT images that decreases noise and artifacts within the image, but without drastically increasing computational burden. Johns Hopkins researchers have proposed an invention called stochastic backprojector. This method modifies an existing backprojection operator to alleviate the impact of sampling artifacts with very minimal computational burden. The method consists of random perturbations of the ray position in each voxel. The perturbations are computed for every ray traced in the reconstruction problem. For the projection angles, new ray intersect positions are computed that can then be used to tune the backprojection to achieve the desire balance between sampling perturbation and fidelity. The method is currently undergoing testing.",

    "ip_description": "Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in American men, behind skin cancer. It is also the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American males, and there is a continuing need for innovation in diagnosis for those at risk for prostate cancer. After initial diagnostic blood tests for prostate-specific antigens, a prostate biopsy may be done if the blood test comes back positive. The current standards for prostate biopsies includes blind sampling under real-time transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and, which yields modest resolutions and inefficient cancer detection rates. MRI/ultrasound fusion biopsies are a recent advancement that involves a preoperative MRI of the prostate used alongside transrectal ultrasound improves cancer detection rates up to 90%. However, s fusion biopsies are expensive and prohibitive due to the use of an MRI scanner, which can limit accessibility in developing nations, underfunded medical systems, and patients with contraindicated implants. Therefore, enhancing precision and sensitivity of cost-effective ultrasound-based imaging technology is necessary to improve access to improved prostate biopsy methods. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a novel technique for prostate biopsy imaging that utilizes ultrasound alongside tomography to better detect malignant tumors that exhibit different speeds of sound and attenuation coefficients in contrast to the surrounding normal tissue. Their technology is far more accurate than ultrasound alone and is less costly than fusion biopsy, thus improving its availability to patients who don\u2019t have access to or are unable to undergo MRI imaging. The inventors have developed the concept and design of the machinery, and in vitro testing has been done.

    "ip_description": "Ultrasound imaging is a popular image guidance modality due to its ability for safe, inexpensive, and real-time imaging in the operating room. One method of using ultrasound for guidance is creating 3D volumes from 2D image data and relating the position of surgical tools to the reconstructed volume, which involves tracking the ultrasound probe in 3D space. However, ultrasound probe calibration is required to compute the spatial transformation between the image pixels and the tracking sensor on the probe. Traditionally, calibration consists of collecting and processing many images of prefabricated phantoms. Not only can the phantom be difficult to fabricate and store (to prevent any geometrical changes), but the calibration process can also be lengthy and difficult to repeat. Furthermore, calibration is typically performed before the procedure, and can become inaccurate due to operational hazards, like a mechanical alteration of the tracking sensors during the procedure. Thus, there exists a need for a new method of ultrasound calibration for quality assurance during surgical, interventional, and biopsy procedures. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel and robust method for 2D and 3D ultrasound probe calibration using a closed form solution. The method consists of using a position sensor that is attached to the probe and is used to record the position and orientation of each image/volume. The calibration procedure uses the image position/orientation in space and the target location in probe coordinates to determine the transformation of the scanning plane with respect to the position sensor. This method significantly improves on other methods because the closed form framework requires very few motions (2 or more) and provides intra-procedural quality control via in vivo re-calibration.",

However, there are several disadvantages of using 3D ultrasound in robotic systems. First, ultrasound itself is unable to detect isoechoic lesions and tumors because they appear to have the same brightness intensities as the surrounding tissue in an image, preventing 3D robotic ultrasound systems from identifying, segmenting, or tracking isoechoic target tissue. Additionally, ablation probes can generate a significant amount of noise, interfering with the ultrasound signal and the ability to generate accurate images. Thus, there is a need for a new imaging system that can detect isoechoic target regions and is robust to noisy environments. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel robotic five-dimensional (5D) ultrasound system that combines 4-D ultrasound imaging (3 spatial dimensions and time) with strain data, creating a volume-rendering pipeline that allows for highly accurate ultrasound imaging with five degrees of freedom. Using elastography imaging, the strain data provides a method of enhancing segmentation and real-time volume rendering of ultrasound data, accounting for motion artifacts and organ deformation. A novel algorithm for ultrasound strain imaging was also developed to help accurately identify targeted lesions and surrounding structures. With this 5D ultrasound data, the system has the potential to help monitor delivered therapy, like biopsy procedures, based on the appearance of isoechoic lesions.",

Evidently, 3-D volumetric CT imaging is a prevalent and profitable means of imaging the body for diagnostic and image-guided medical procedures. However, one of the current challenges with CT imaging is the quality of the overall image due to image artifacts that arise from high-density metal objects, such as surgical clips, staples, and instruments, generally referred to as \u201cmetal artifacts.\u201d A high-density of metal objects in the field of view can severely degrade image quality and obscure visualization of nearby anatomy. Some methods for metal artifact reduction (MAR) have been proposed but they require prior information about the metal objects, which is not always possible. Thus, there is a need for a new method to help reduce metal artifacts in CT scans without the need of additional information for each scan. Johns Hopkins inventors have developed a method called Metal Artifact Avoidance (MAA), which makes no assumptions of prior information of the patient of metal implants and can be used in combination with other metal artifact reduction methods. Using this method, the patient will be placed on the table as usual at the beginning of the procedure. Two scout views of the patient will be acquired as usual. Then, in order to localize the dense anatomy and metal objects, the two views will be backprojected to form a coarse 3D attenuation map which is then segmented to form a coarse 3D attenuation map. A metric map is then calculated and an objective function is defined to capture the overall severity of metal artifacts. Then, the 3D scan of the patient is performed with the tilted circular trajectory and the 3D image is reconstructed using well established methods. Thus, a source-detector trajectory is determined that avoids metal artifacts prior to the actual 3D scan. A prototype has been developed and tested in preclinical studies.",

The sleep clinic setting also introduces a suboptimal testing environment: in addition to having foreign items on the patient\u2019s head, their sleep is disturbed by being in a new environment instead of their usual home. The technician\u2019s process of interpreting the PSG signals and converting to a hypnogram, which is used for diagnosis by a physician, is labor intensive (20-30 minutes) and inherently subjective.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia is caused by a genetic translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17 [t(15:17)] and clinically presents as a cancer that progresses rapidly with poor survival. Due to the acute nature of its presentation, prompt and accurate diagnosis is required to initiate appropriate therapy that can be curative. However, the gold standard genetic tests can take days to confirm a diagnosis and thus therapy is often initiated on high clinical suspicion based on both clinical presentation as well as direct visualization of the peripheral smear. While there are described cellular morphological features that distinguish acute promyelocytic leukemia, there is still considerable difficulty in diagnosing from direct visualization of a peripheral smear by a hematopathologist. Therefore, there is a strong need for a reliable diagnostic test for acute promyelocytic leukemia that can rapidly inform clinicians with decisions that benefit patient survival. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a novel approach to detect the presence of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in peripheral blood smears by leveraging artificial intelligence. By applying both cell-level and patient-level classification, this invention demonstrated the capability of distinguishing APL in both a discovery and prospective independent cohort of patients. Furthermore, this approach extracts learned information from the trained network to identify previously undescribed morphological features of APL.

Although fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is the most accurate means of diagnosing thyroid nodules, up to 30% of FNA samples are \u201cindeterminate\u201d and require further molecular diagnostics. This situation has been further complicated by the American Thyroid Association\u2019s (ATA) recent reclassification of a subgroup of a malignant follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) to nonmalignant noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP), a neoplasm with very low malignant potential in the management guidelines for thyroid tumors. Currently, there is no in vitro test that can definitively assess thyroid nodule status in all indeterminate cases and inform the optimal surgical approach based on risk-benefit ratio. All current molecular tests have high sensitivity but suffer from a lack of specificity, resulting in overtreatment of benign lesions and unnecessary surgeries. Overtreatment of indolent thyroid cancer is not only associated with side effects and risks, but also with significant economic impact. Thus, a new approach is urgently needed to provide accurate preoperative assessment of thyroid nodules to avoid thyroidectomy for indolent disease. The inventors at Johns Hopkins have developed a quantitative RT-PCR based diagnostic gene panel with high sensitivity and specificity to distinguish benign from malignant tumors.

    "ip_description": "Globally, approximately 300,000 brain cancers are diagnosed each year, which results in about 227,000 deaths (Lancet Neurology). Primary central nervous system B-cell lymphomas (PCNSL) are an aggressive and rare disease, which can involve brain, eye or leptomeninges without evidence of systemic disease (Low, S. et al. 2018). A surgical biopsy of brain tissue is the current gold standard for the diagnosis of central nervous system lymphoma from other forms of brain cancer. This invasive procedure has a high-complication rate of 8.5%, with adverse events consisting of hematomas, seizures or brain edema, and even the occurrence of biopsy\u2010related mortality in 1% of cases (Khatab, S. et al. 2014). Therefore, there is a strong need to identify reliable biomarkers and establish a companion diagnostic test that can differentiate PCNSL from other brain tumors in a non-invasive manner, while maintaining high-accuracy and shortening the time to diagnosis. Johns Hopkins researchers have identified new molecular biomarkers to distinguish Primary Central Nervous System Lymphomas from other types of brain tumors and have developed a novel methylation-specific diagnostic assay to measure methylated DNA with high-accuracy. The inventor\u2019s further aim to validate the markers and companion diagnostic test in a non-invasive setting, which would eliminate the detrimental risks introduced during a surgically-invasive brain tissue biopsy.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a novel paradigm for the induction of synthetic lethality through epigenetic modulations. This can induce functionality and efficacy of therapeutics against cancer cells that may have resistance to each therapeutic alone. The complex and adaptive nature of the host of diseases termed cancer poses significant challenges. Many therapeutics which confer an initial benefit to patients may fail to maintain efficacy as the disease develops resistance mechanisms. This challenge can render otherwise effective drugs useless for an indicated disease. This invention is a paradigm for the re-sensitization of cancer cells to anti-cancer agents. The inventors have demonstrated that existing pharmacological agents can alter render cancer cells susceptible to therapeutics to which resistance has occurred. Advantages include: \u00b7      Restoration of efficacy for a therapeutic that fails as a single agent \u00b7      Induction of selective efficacy against cancer cells over healthy host cells \u00b7      Persistence of sensitization after removal of the epigenetic agent \u00b7      Changes are seen with low-dose, sub-cytotoxic amounts of agent. This paradigm makes use of a pharmacological or genetic agent that can alter the epigenetic machinery for the epigenetic \u201creprogramming\u201d of cancer cells. Through these changes it is possible to induce new vulnerabilities to targeted therapeutics which would otherwise be ineffective. The work by the inventors has demonstrated the establishment and maintenance of the appropriate epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, at regions critical for chromosomal integrity can produce mitotic catastrophe (i.e. cell death) in cancer cells through epigenetic dysregulation. This paradigm holds promise as a novel treatment approach for cancer that can allow for the use of targeted agents that might otherwise have failed as single agents.",

    "ip_description": "The human cerebroarterial system is composed of a complex system of arteries that supply the brain cells with oxygen and nutrition. Cerebroarterial networks are difficult to analyze due to their composition of small and large arteries, which have a complex organization of branches and cyclic connections that varies among individuals. Analyzing cerebroarterial structures could aid diagnosis and research of multiple cerebrovascular diseases, such as stenoses, aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, or ischemic strokes, all of which are related to alterations of the arterial system. Changes in the cerebrovascular system could also prove valuable as early biomarkers for neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. However, detecting structural arterial abnormalities requires detailed knowledge of the normal morphology and distribution of the cerebral arteries in the brain. Conventional, two-dimensional, manually-drawn atlases suffer from a lack of flexibility; if the set of template slices provided in the atlas do not match the slice thickness or orientation of acquired clinical neuroimages, the atlas utility is diminished. Even with well-aligned two-dimensional slices lack precision and do not allow for quantitative assessment of vascular territories in a single patient. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a human brain atlas based on lesion distributions in 1,298 acute stroke patients. The atlas provides straightforward and robustly-defined watershed border zones and contains hierarchical segmentation levels created by a fusion of vascular and classical anatomical criteria.",

    "ip_description": "Abnormal cardiac rhythms are often fatal. Specifically, ventricular arrhythmias, caused by abnormal electrical signals in the ventricles, cause 75 to 80% of sudden cardiac deaths every year. To prevent abnormal electrical activity in patients with various idiopathic ventricular tachycardias (IVA), radiofrequency intracardiac catheter ablation is used to create scars, which is effective and safe in preventing adverse events. However, the proper identification of treatment site can take a long time. During the procedure, a 3D non-fluoroscopic electroanatomic mapping (EAM) system is used to acquire intracardiac electrical information at different locations, and each candidate site is tested to identify engaged tissue locations until the IVA origin site is found. Not only is this a time-consuming procedure, but there is also limited localization accuracy in identifying the exact origin of the IVA. Thus, a new method is urgently needed for identifying the origin of IVAs accurately and timely during radiofrequency intracardiac catheter ablation procedures. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed an improved system, known as the Automatic Arrhythmia Origin Localization (AAOL) system, for localizing the origin of IVAs in real time. The system is an intraprocedural 3D cardiac localization system that computes the site of early electrical activation of the ventricles in real time with improved accuracy on cardiac structures where pace-mapping is challenging, such as the right ventricle and aortic root. The approach takes advantage of 3-lead ECG (leads III, V2, V6) recordings and intracardiac patient-specific EAM geometry (partial or full geometry) to acquire patient-specific pacing information, which is used to predict IVA origin sites. In preliminary testing, it has achieved a mean localization accuracy of 3.6mm for 23 IVAs, which is significantly better than previous systems. Clinical testing.",

Additionally, unlike large peptide blockers that have difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier, tonabersat\u2019s small size enables it to easily penetrate the blood-brain barrier to target astroglial cells in the central nervous system. Also, as an orally available compound, tonabersat has an excellent safety profile and is already shown to be well-tolerated in studies for patients with migraine. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tonabersat can protect motor neurons from astrocyte-induced toxicity, which may slow the process of motor neuron degeneration during ALS\u2019s disease progression. The inventors have performed in vitro cell culture studies that identified a target (astrocytic Cx43) and demonstrated that inhibition of Cx43 can protect motor neurons from cell death, verifying the viability of the target for ALS treatment.

PDAs account for more than 90% of all pancreatic malignancies and are the fourth most frequent cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Almost all PDAs develop following the activation of the KRAS gene. This activation triggers epithelial transformation and recruitment of desmoplastic stroma through additional transcriptional and epigenetic regulation. Then there occurs sequential progression involving genetic hits in several tumor suppressor genes, resulting in the starting stages of PDA. Thus, there is a need for a way to de-activate the KRAS gene to decrease the possibility of the development of PDA. Johns Hopkins inventors have profiled dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs). They started with the earliest premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) in genetically engineered mutated KRAS and P53 (KPSC) mice. The mice were programmed to recapitulate human PDA tumorigenesis. The inventors identified cell-specific and compartment-specific regulators in PanINs and PDA. The regulators were then tested to see if they were useful for early PanIn detection or for interception of developing premalignant pancreatic lesions and other KRAS-driven premalignancies.

There is an unmet need to develop a high-throughput method for the efficient and simultaneous analysis of DNA and RNA from the same cell. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a high-throughput method to simultaneously analyze targeted DNA and whole transcriptomes from single cells. The method allows for genotyping of single cells while their transcriptome is captured in parallel. Briefly, a single cell is lysed in a droplet, in-droplet digital PCR is performed to amplify a genomic region of interest, and this amplified DNA, in addition to the mRNA, is captured by a barcoded bead for sequencing. Proof of concept studies have demonstrated successful analysis of a heterogenous population of human induced pluripotent stem cells after CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, obviating the need for clonal selection, expansion, genotyping, and batch effect elimination normally required post CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.

As neurons within the brain communicate through electrical charges, the ability to manipulate the delivery of such electrical charges through a stimulation machine may be beneficial for neuro-rehabilitation. Examples of such efforts already underway include the application of neural stimulation to individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (see Brunelin et al. 2018).

Researchers at Johns Hopkins have conceptualized a novel approach of providing electrical stimulation to the brain for the purpose of altering the tactile perception of humans. Specifically, the technology electrically stimulates targeted regions of the brain that correspond to areas of the body while applying constant tactile pressure over flat surfaces. This results in a novel sensation wherein the flat surfaces appear to be indented if electrical stimulation is delivered in the same spatial location at the same time.

    "ip_description": "Life threatening ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a precursor of sudden cardiac death. VT may occur in patients with weakened heart muscle such as in the case of myocardiopathy and/or chronic myocardial infarction (MI). Radiofrequency catheter ablation is applied to regions of conduction delay to treat and or prevent the recurrence of these arrhythmias. Identifying the target regions within the heart is an invasive procedure that requires the induction of VT while the patient is under anesthesia. VT-induction is not always possible or well-tolerated in some patients and results of this invasive approach may vary under anesthesia. Moreover, several VT-inductions are required to find multiple regions of reentry. Measurement variability and repeated VT-inductions highlight the strong necessity for a heart measurement tool that is capable of accurately identifying regions of re-entry that are safe and broadly applicable to individuals with ventricular tachycardia. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have co-developed a personalized 3D computational model of human heart with myocardial infarction based on the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which provides activation-repolarization data for the reentry vulnerability index (RVI) algorithm. The novelty of the model includes electrophysiology, ventricular geometry, and structural remodelling (including scar) that facilitates in silico electrical stimulation of the ventricle. The technology further uses RVI as a metric to identify region(s) with high vulnerability to reentry (with a low RVI value) using a patient-specific computational human heart model. The region(s) located by RVI are, therefore, ablated in order to prevent the heart from re-entrant VT and to prevent sudden death.

    "ip_description": "Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are a major cause of death in the United States, with an estimated 100,000+ deaths and $40 billion in medical costs annually. Carvedilol is a beta-blocker that is prescribed over 20 million times annually and is used to treat patients with congestive heart failure. The drug is typically most effective when taken at the maximum-tolerable dosage; however, overdose may lead to ADRs such as bradycardia and hypotension. Given this risk in already vulnerable patients, physicians typically do not prescribe a higher dosage. Therefore, there is a need for a method to determine the optimal dosage in each patient to maximize the efficacy of Carvedilol and minimize the risk for ADRs. Inventors at Johns Hopkins have developed novel machine learning algorithms trained on physiological signals data and clinical data including heart rate after drug administration and heart rate after diagnosis of heart conditions. Using these algorithms, predictive models have been created as a decision aid tool to alert and inform clinicians on the risk of ADR from Carvedilol treatment. These algorithms have high potential for application in other common drugs and treatment regimens (such as chemotherapy) to reduce potential for ADR-related patient harm. A preliminary model has been developed with clinical data from an available database.",

    "ip_description": "According to the Pearlman School of Medicine, pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) occurs frequently and has a high mortality rate. Each year more than 15,000 children receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for cardiac arrest during hospitalization in the United States (Topjian, et al., 2021). As many as 80% to 90% survive the event, but most patients do not survive to hospital discharge. Low survival rates are due in part to the poor administration of CPR techniques and deviation from resuscitation guidelines. Proper CPR in children is difficult because the depth and hand placement of chest compressions vary by age. There is a great need for a guidance platform to assist in administration of high quality chest compressions that can improve survival outcomes for pediatric CPR. Johns Hopkins researchers have conceptualized an augmented reality (AR) system for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). AR is a modality that can visually display real-time feedback to a user on their chest compression technique. The system includes sends wireless feedback on chest compression rate, depth, and recoil during CPR administration. Chest compression feedback, tailored to a patient\u2019s age, will be displayed on an AR headset worn by a user performing CPR. The user can then take the visual feedback seen on the AR headset and adjust their quality of chest compressions (rate, depth) in real time. This AR system may improve CPR quality and thereby pediatric survival of cardiac arrest. While this technology will be developed with a pediatric patient in mind, it translates to patients of all ages.",

In this procedure, a long thin and hollow plastic tube called a catheter is inserted into a vein manually and guided towards the heart. Often times, CVA is aided by the use of ultrasound to provide real time visualization during catheter insertion. Placement of the catheter allows for reliable vascular access in those requiring prolonged intravenous therapies or in critically ill patients. While ultrasound guidance has significantly reduced the incidence of complications from rates as high as 11.8 to 4-7% through improved visualization, operator experience is still a significant contributor to complications (International Journal of Critical Illness and Injury Science, 2015). Complications can include bleeding, arterial puncture, arrythmia, and pneumothorax that often.

Recent advances in machine learning are particularly promising to provide feedback, optimization and instrument control in real-time during complex experimental processes. Instance segmentation, the process of correctly detecting and accurately identifying the relevant objects within an image, is a critical step in the advanced analysis of image data but is often complicated by the lack of appropriate quality and quantity of application-specific training data. Therefore, there is a strong need for the development of machine learning (ML) system for the optimization of floating zone furnace melt geometry to improve the accuracy of instance segmentation. Johns Hopkins researchers have demonstrated that machine learning methods, specifically deep neural networks, can be used to efficiently, and in real time, segment video frames during growth, identify the size and shape of the molten zone, and classify its stability. Transfer learning enables rapid, effective model training to discriminate between three common zone stability modes with under 1000 manually labeled training artifacts. Sustained drops in model confidence effectively indicate transitions between modes and enable operator intervention to restabilize the growth. In addition, Hopkins scientists have also found that this model, trained on labeled images of a single material family, effectively identifies zone transitions during growth of a second, distinct class of materials, i.e., ML/ Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, avoids the need for per-material training. This automated and robust instance segmentation paves the way for the efficient acceleration and automation of the synthesis of new, functional materials by the widely used floating-zone method.

The candidates, BCL-G and CMPK2, are previously unappreciated interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) found to be upregulated in activated CD4+ T cells from a cohort of HIV patients after treatment with type I interferon (IFN). Upregulation was also observed for known HIV restriction factors including MX2 and tetherin. In addition, induction was highly correlated with decline in circulating HIV viral RNA after treatment, indicating that upregulation of these ISG candidates can restrict HIV replication in vivo. Further validation of identified ISGs in controlling HIV was performed in vitro using siRNA knockdown of each candidate and showed loss of HIV restriction upon knockdown.

The American Chemistry Council has calculated that 35.4 million tons of plastic municipal solid waste (MSW) were generated in the U.S. alone in 2017. This number accounted for 13.2% of total MSW generation worldwide. The EPA states that the overall rate of plastic recycling in 2017 was just 8.4%. There is, thus, a large need to improve the recycling processes for plastics and for greater attention toward their end-of-life management. Chemical recycling is becoming a popular landfill alternative, and provides benefits over incineration, which emits toxic compounds. Current chemical recycling methods are inefficient with respect to energy usage (requiring high temperatures and/or pressures) and do not generate consistent products from the reactions. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a process for upcycling plastics waste that employs a more active, selective, and stable Zeolite catalyst. The upcycling process with this Zeolite catalyst generates valuable products from the chemical recycling process, such as benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX). The researchers have fully developed and tested the catalyst.",

    "ip_description": "As of 2019, the nitrogen oxides emissions in the United States is around 8 million tons per year. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) play a major role in several important environmental and human health effects. NOx reacts with organic compounds in sunlight and forms ozone. Additionally, NOx reacts in the air to form compounds contributing to acid deposition, which can damage forests and cause lakes and streams to acidify. Deposition of NOx affects nitrogen cycles, which contributes to the growth of algae, disrupting the chemical balance of nutrients in water. Because of the evident need to decrease NOx emissions, many different products have started to appear in the pipeline. The most common method for reducing NOx is the NOx adsorber. However, current absorbers contain platinum group metals (PGMs) that are expensive, limiting their practical application. Thus, there is a need for a cheaper method of absorbing NOx emissions. The inventors have created an NOx adsorber with a primary application of low-temperature absorption from exhaust gas. The adsorber comprises a manganese-based sorbent deposited on a high surface area carrier. The manganate oxide sorbent contains about 1-50% by weight of alkali-metal manganese based on the total weight of the material. Additionally, the invention includes an exhaust system comprising NOx adsorbers. The new sorbent serves better than PGM for NOx storage and release under the various operating conditions and different temperatures during the startup operation periods of automobiles. The invention has been developed and tested.",

In order to treat this condition, brain shunts are inserted surgically into a ventricle to drain the excess fluid.

However, with shunt placements, there is no current way to detect if the pressure build up has decreased and if a reduction in flow has occurred. Thus, there is a need for a device that can aid in real-time monitoring of a brain shunt.

This shunt will monitor the brain\u2019s pressure, CSF flow, chemistry of the CSF and electric waves.

These incidences include hospital visits due to recreational activities or high contact sports such as football, basketball, and hockey. Competitive contact sports require players to wear protective equipment which currently cannot provide real time health condition updates to improve athlete safety and performance. Mouth guards offer a unique opportunity for technological intervention given that measurements of head movements and saliva content can inform of potential trauma or metabolic status. Accordingly, there is a need for 'intelligent' mouth guards which guide decisions for optimal athletic performance, health and safety. Existing mouth guards can collect data on acceleration (linear & rotational), but lack the capability of receiving and managing data from other types of sensors such as temperature, Ph, lactose, location, impact direction, etc. Johns Hopkins researchers developed an intelligent, moldable, pacifier-style mouth guard for improving athletic performance (IMAP). The mouth guard includes sensors that provide data about each athlete in real time and assesses performance based on hydration, lactic acidosis, concussion, and fatigue. It is energized by a long-life battery (6-12 months). Data streams via wireless interface (and cloud storage) providing visual analytic solutions for individual athletic performance improvement in real time that inform coaches, physicians, and athletes.

    "ip_description": "Dizziness is one of the most common complaints, affecting approximately 20-30% of the general population. Vertigo, a type of dizziness, is an illusion of movement caused by an asymmetric involvement of the vestibular system. While most cases are clearly due to a benign ear condition such as vestibular neuritis, about 3-5% of the 4.4 million patients present with acute dizziness or dizziness, known as acute vestibular syndrome (AVS), each year in the U.S. due to stroke. As dizziness and vertigo are mostly tightly linked to undiagnosed strokes, a three-part eye exam called HINTS was developed to detect stroke in AVS patients with high accuracy. It is a series of bedside clinical tests consisting of the head impulse test (HI), characterization of spontaneous nystagmus (N), and test of skew (TS). Although the HINTS exam is a validated tool for ruling out stroke in AVS patients with greater sensitivity and specificity than neuroimaging, it is often under-utilized in most emergency departments due to its steep learning curve and intensive training requirement, with most physicians opting for neuroimaging instead. This contributes to a low awareness and adoption of this exam in the emergency department, especially since the accuracy of the HINTS exam was shown via specialist physicians and expertly trained emergency room physicians. Thus, there is a need for a method of making the HINTS exam more accessible to ambulatory or emergency room personnel in order to reduce the amount of unnecessary neuroimaging during the diagnosis process. Johns Hopkins researchers developed a smartphone-based HINTS exam to help diagnose patients with vertigo and dizziness. This technology analyzes video recordings of patients during the HINTS exam, guides the patient and physician through the exam, and provides a diagnostic report which indicates whether the test is positive for a possible stroke or negative, suggesting a benign inner ear condition.",

HIV is a serious health issue, and around 1 million people die from HIV/AIDS related illnesses each year. Currently, there is no cure for HIV, only prevention and treatment techniques exist. Current methods of treatment use antiretroviral therapy (ART), which can suppress HIV, but cannot cure HIV. The virus is very difficult to eradicate due to the permanent integration of HIV genomes into the host cell chromosomes of immune cells, causing a latent pro-viral reservoir to be formed. Thus, there is a need for a way to specifically study and reverse HIV latency to pave the path to creation of targets and drugs that can help eradicate the disease. The inventors have constructed a Cas9-expressing cell line to serve as a polyclonal in vitro model for HIV-1 latency-related studies. The cell line consists of Jurkat-based cells, which were transduced by a GFP expressing defective lentiviral vector generated by the Karn Lab at Case Western University. The cells that exhibited GFP signals (GFP+) were sorted 5 days post-infection and were kept in culture for five weeks. Then, the modified post-sorting Jurkat cells were transduced by lentiCas9-Blast virus and turned into Cas9-expressing HIV-infected Jurkat cells. At the end of the 5-week incubation, cells without GFP expression (GFP-) were sorted, followed by TNF-\u237a stimulation. The GFP+ cells were sorted after the stimulation and kept in culture for another week. Finally, the GFP- cells were sorted and used as the latently HIV-infected polyclonal Jurkat cells for CRISPR screening. All GFP-based cell isolations were achieved at >99.9% purity. The inventors showed that HIV-1 gene expression can be re-induced in >90% of this cell population by TNF-\u237a treatment, as evidenced by GFP expression. The cell line is ready to use for the purposes of studying HIV-1 latency and developing latency reversal agents in academic and industrial settings.",

    "ip_description": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor in adults and remains one of the most aggressive types of malignancies. The mainstay of GBM treatment is surgery, radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy using temozolomide (TMZ). While treatment options have incrementally improved, survival rates remains dismal. Only 25% of GBM patients survive more than one year, and less than 5% of patients survive more than five years. Consequently, there is a need for novel adjuvant therapies to improve outcomes for GBM patients. The inventors have developed a therapeutic approach to improve the efficacy of TMZ therapy in GBM. This approach uses an oral formulation of TMZ and terameprocol (M4N), another chemotherapy drug, to boost the cytotoxic effect of TMZ. This combination chemotherapy was able to halt tumor growth in a mouse model of GBM. Importantly, this enhanced anti-tumor effect was observable even at low concentrations of M4N, at which there is no measurable in vivo cytotoxicity. The inventors also demonstrated that the administration of M4N enhances the titers of specific antitumor antibodies in the sera and promotes the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of NK cells to suppress tumor growth. Thus, the addition of M4N to a TMZ regimen can boost the anti-tumor activity of TMZ not only through its cytotoxic activity, but also via activation of host humoral immunity. The efficacy of this combination chemotherapy has been demonstrated in vivo.",

Increasing resistance develops with each subsequent line of hormonal therapy. There exists an unmet clinical need to overcome resistance to hormone deprivation therapy and establish a more efficacious standard treatment for patients progressing on second-line hormonal therapy. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a sequential drug regimen to overcome resistance in men with castration resistant prostate cancer. The team previously reported on high dose testosterone as an effective second-line hormonal therapy for men with castrate resistant prostate cancer. Here, the researchers build on the successes of their findings to develop a treatment for patients progressing on standard second-line hormonal therapy that consists of sequential high dose testosterone and anti-androgen therapy followed by immune therapy. Sequential high dose testosterone and anti-androgen appears enhances and prolongs and survival and appears superior to second-line antiandrogen alone.

The World Health Organization has initiatives in twelve countries to ensure universal healthcare coverage, with access to quality and affordable care for mental health conditions, for over 100 million people (BCC-HLC256A 2020, WHO). In the United States, 26% of Americans ages 18 or older suffer from a diagnosable mental health disorder in a given year (JHU Medicine, Mental Health Statistics). However, far too often patients with mental health disorders receive substandard care at high out-of-pocket costs. As a result, both public and private health insurance providers are now shifting from a fee-for-service to pay-for performance or outcome-based model. This type of model incentivizes health care providers to initiate proper care and necessary referrals immediately upon a patient\u2019s diagnosis (BCC-HLC212A 2018). There is a need in the mental health community for a process that simplifies entry into the mental health care system and clarifies the type of management (e.g., medications, psychotherapy) needed.

Scleroderma is a disease that may affect many organs of the body and is characterized by progressive fibrosis, vascular disease and immunological derangements. Scleroderma is highly variable in clinical phenotype, trajectory, treatment response and mortality. Many different complications can occur, and while there are risk factors for these complications that have been identified in population studies, it has been difficult to translate this information to clinical practice at the patient level to inform targeted screening or therapeutic intervention. Aggregating complex, longitudinal data to understand patients\u2019 health state and risk of major clinical events requires a tremendous time investment on the part of the treating provider. To facilitate improved medical decision making, there is a strong need for a technology that provides longitudinal, multisystem data for scleroderma patients, along with risk assessments for future clinical events. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a tool that collects patient-level data in a manner that is easily accessible to clinicians, integrates knowledge of known outcomes from other patients that share key clinical characteristics, and generates personalized risk estimates for multiple complications to improve medical decision making for patients with scleroderma.

    "ip_description": "Methylation is the process through which methyl groups are attached to DNA, altering expression of certain genes. During breast cancer development, hypermethylation of DNA in specific regions known as CpG islands located in tumor suppressor genes occurs, so DNA methylation increases in select tumor specific genes may be associated with malignant progression. After screening for methylation markers that were present in low or undetectable levels in benign breast disease, but were present at easily detectable levels in malignant breast cancer, the inventors identified 6 genes that could reliably distinguish between benign and malignant tumors in various types of breast diseases (usual ductal hyperplasia, papilloma, fibroadenoma) and cancer. While previous work on applying methylated marker panels has primarily concentrated on classifying tumors as in situ or lobular, this panel is the first methylated marker panel specifically selected to distinguish between malignant and benign lesions for diagnostic purposes. By using such a molecular diagnostic test, patients can receive a rapid diagnosis that subtypes their tumor within 5 hours, allowing treatment plans to be made without delay. Consequently, this panel overcomes the long delays associated with histopathological analysis and may help drive down the mortality rate of breast cancers in LMICs. An automated cartridge for breast cancer detection was also developed alongside the panel. Because the panel is automated, it is not skill- or specialist-dependent, enabling more efficient processing of caseloads and expedited diagnosis.",

Their care may be fragmented, uncoordinated, non-aligned with their values and priorities, and unresponsive to the needs of their family caregivers. It is always very expensive. Fortunately, new value-based payment models now offer financial incentives for healthcare systems to provide this population with care that is comprehensive, coordinated, proactive and aligned with patients\u2019 and families\u2019 values.\n\nTechnology overview\nIn alignment with these emerging incentives, \u201cGuided Care\u201d now offers a novel solution for providing high-value healthcare for people with complex needs \u2013 and for their families. \n\u00b7        In Guided Care, a specially certified registered nurse, who is based in a primary care practice, partners with the patient\u2019s other providers in delivering eight services to 75-100 chronically ill patients. Following a comprehensive in-home assessment and planning process, the Guided Care Nurse monitors each patient monthly, guides the patient\u2019s self-management, smooths the patient\u2019s transitions between sites of care, coordinates the efforts of all of the patient\u2019s providers, facilitates the patient\u2019s access to community services and supports the patient\u2019s family caregivers. \n\u00b7        A Guided Care license provides licensees with:\no   Permission to use the Guided Care model and name\no   The \u201cHealth History Questionnaire\u201d that guides the in-home assessment\no   A template for the \u201cPreliminary Care Guide\u201d (the Guided Care Nurse\u2019s initial draft plan of care that results from the in-home assessment)\no   A template for the \u201cCare Guide\u201d (the final plan of care that integrates input from the Guided Care Nurse, the physician, the patient and the caregiver)\no   A template for the \u201cAction Plan\u201d (the patient-friendly version of the \u201cCare Guide\u201d that reminds the patient of personalized self-management tasks that will optimize health and function).\n\u00b7        Implementation of Guided Care in primary care practices is facilitated by:\no   A detailed implementation manual\no   An online 40-hour course provided by the Institute for Johns Hopkins Nursing to prepare RNs to become Guided Care Nurses\no   A patient information booklet.\n\u00b7        A cluster-randomized controlled trial (n=904) showed that Guided Care provides high-value care by improving the quality of care and reducing complex (expensive) patients\u2019 overall healthcare costs. It also improves physicians\u2019 satisfaction and reduces the strain felt by family caregivers.\n\nFuture use\nGuided Care is a valuable solution for healthcare systems that wish to succeed as they make the transition from fee-for-service to value-based models of payment for healthcare.",

    "ip_description": "Left heart filling pressure (LHFP) is an important clinical marker for cardiac dysfunction. Current tests that assess LHFP are limited in sensitivity, specificity, portability, and cost, and/or are not applicable in patients with arrythmias. There exists an unmet need to develop non-invasive tools for assessment of LHFP that overcome these limitations. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed an algorithm to non-invasively assess LHFP during the Valsalva maneuver. The team previously discovered that measurement of LHFP via analysis of the change in amplitude of a finger photoplethysmography (PPG) waveform during the Valsalva maneuver correlates to the invasive gold standard measurement of LHFP. However, the presence of arrythmias challenges this non-invasive assessment, which is dependent on the precise identification of waveform peaks and valleys. Here, the researchers have developed a novel and noninvasive method for assessing LHFP during the Valsalva maneuver that involves employing an algorithm that analyzes the cardiac cycle in its entirely, independent of analysis of waveform peaks and valleys. The method has been validated in human subjects. Value Proposition: \u00b7 Automated and non-invasive method for determining LHFP \u00b7 Robust analysis of the entire waveform independent of precise identification of peaks and valleys \u00b7 Applicable in patients with and without arrythmias.",

Particularly, Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) represents a highly prevalent autoimmune disease, affecting over 20 million people. These diseases occur when the body\u2019s immune system incorrectly attacks healthy cells and tissues. To combat autoimmune diseases, recent treatment strategies have focused on regulatory T cells (Tregs) which modulate immune responses. Immunocytokines (IC) consisting of an antibody and IL-2 cytokine have recently developed as a method of preferentially engaging and expanding such Tregs. However, antigen specificity, which is an important therapeutic characteristic for improving targeted efficacy has yet to be engineered in conjunction with existing ICs. Tolerogenic antigen presenting cells (TolAPCs) consisting of a biodegradable particle surface-conjugated with a combination of IC and autoantigen-loaded MHC tetramers have been developed. TolAPCs are synthesized by forming a polymer core and covalently attaching ICs and specific autoantigen complexes to the surface. To evaluate performance, TolAPCs were incubated in-vitro with CD4+ T cells and compared to free IL-2 cytokine and free IC complexes. TolAPCs selectively stimulated Treg populations and achieved the same stimulation as free IC and greater stimulation than free IL-2. In an in-vivo mouse model, TolAPCs also increased the ratio of Treg cells compared to a no treatment condition. Altogether, the inventors have demonstrated efficacy of TolAPCs as an antigen specific IC based regulatory T cell modulator. A proof of concept was demonstrated in-vitro and in an in-vivo mouse model.",

These diseases often result in the loss of bone cells in affected areas which can lead to several other complications such as osteoporosis and tooth loss. Such complications impede patients\u2019 quality of life and well-being, making it crucial to find a material that can efficiently regenerate bone density. However, bone regeneration is an extremely complex physiological process that requires various biological materials and environmental conditions. As a consequence, it is difficult to find a scaffold or synthetic material that is biologically stable and biocompatible when used in vivo. Due to their chemical similarity to human bones and teeth, calcium phosphate materials have received a great deal of research and funding in recent years. Calcium phosphate materials are nontoxic and have shown exceptional biocompatibility. It is an inexpensive material with considerable reliability when used in vivo, reducing inspection and maintenance required during application. The technology proposed utilizes a new method of generating calcium phosphate materials using a piezoelectric matrix. The process generates a novel self-adaptable regenerative calcium phosphate material, increasing the material\u2019s performance and operational flexibility. In addition, this method does not use biological processes to form the material, and thus can be used in a wide variety of environments. Such an optimal and adjustable mechanism offers a new form of bone regeneration that demonstrates a significant improvement over existing methods which will improve patient outcomes.

    "ip_description": "The liver is a critical organ that performs more than 500 physiological functions in the human body including maintenance of metabolic homeostasis, digestion of drugs & hormones, and secretion of essential proteins. Unfortunately, the liver is susceptible to a wide variety of diseases that generally result from viral infection, inheritance of deleterious genetic mutations, and exposure to toxic compounds (poisons, pollution, drugs, alcohol, etc.). Genetic liver disorders \u2013 including Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency), Wilson\u2019s Disease, and Hemophilia \u2013 have limited treatment options and incur significant morbidity & mortality. Standard-of-care treatments for such genetic liver diseases typically involve protein replacement therapies that compensate for the loss of a functional protein due to an inherited mutation. However, these treatments require patients to take weekly or daily doses of various drugs throughout their lifetime. This problem has led to the development of gene therapies, which are intended to cure or significantly improve clinical outcomes for patients with genetic liver disorders by delivering a small number of doses that are effective over long periods of time. Many emerging gene therapies leverage viral vectors to introduce a gene to organs, which can then produce therapeutic levels of a protein for months or years. Nevertheless, viral gene therapies are limited by (1) reduced efficacy due to patient immune responses and technical constraints, (2) prohibitively high cost of manufacturing at scale, (3) and regulatory challenges related to adverse side effects & opaque quality control standards. As such, there is a need treatments for genetic liver disorders that provide a sustained benefit while avoiding many of the challenges associated with viral gene therapies. Inventors at Johns Hopkins have developed a method for delivering nucleic acids and/or proteins into liver cells (hepatocytes) through hydrodynamic injection via a surgical procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This invention can be leveraged as a non-viral gene therapy to treat a wide array of genetic liver disorders.",

Among them, 1D nanostructured wires/tubes have become the focus of recent research. Extensive work reveals that nanowires and nanotubes have unique electronic, optical, magnetic, and mechanical properties, owning to the quantum confinement effect and large surface area. Even though prototypes of device made of nanowires and nanotubes have been demonstrated, such as logic unit, in microchips, nano-lasers, optical switches, and sensors for cellular and molecular diagnosis, the application of nanowire as technologically useful materials has been greatly hindered by the difficulties in handling nanowires. With our invention, nanoparticles with high aspect ratios, such as carbon nanotubes and nanowires, can be moved and positioned onto designated locations with sub-micron precision (150 nm). The orientation, the velocity and the direction of the motion can be controlled independently. The moving direction can be either parallel or perpendicular to the orientation of the longitudinal nano-entity. The Manipulation is so versatile that the longitudinal nano-entities have been set into motion with prescribed tracks, such as squares and zigzags. The positioning of the nanoparticles is highly efficient and accurate that nanoparticles can be easily placed onto any designed place, e.g. dock onto arrays of nanodots. With this technique, nano-entities can be efficiently incorporated into devices as elements for sensors, detector, and logic units. Nanoparticles can also be used as building blocks to assemble micro-electromechanical (MEMS) devices. For demonstration purpose, a nano-oscillator has been built from elongated nano-entities and set into oscillation. Ordered Arrays of nano-motors have been assembled onto magnetic bearings.

TILs involve the use of special immune cells called T-cells, otherwise known as lymphocytes, which protect the body from viral infections, fight cancer, and coordinate the activities of other cells during an immune response. Effective cancer immunotherapy requires robust effector T cell responses which critically involves T cell receptor signaling. TILs may offer a new target for cancer immunotherapy \u2013 to allow the precise killing of cells through tumor antigen recognition \u2013 and may also serve as a prognostic biomarker in a variety of cancers. The inventors have proposed a way to enhance TILs activity via inhibition of a specific protein tyrosine phosphatase located in lymphocytes. This novel method can be used in tandem with other immunotherapy technology, such as checkpoint inhibitors, to serve as an effective immunotherapy treatment. The inventors have shown the knockout of the specific protein in mice, exhibited significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to wildtype mice. This finding was associated with increased presence of TILs, suggesting that the underlying mechanism indeed involves cancer-specific T cell responses. Furthermore, when combined with a well-known checkpoint inhibitor, which is a standard immunotherapy agent used for the treatment of multiple types of cancers, the knockout mice have significantly augmented suppression of tumor growth compared to that of wildtype mice. This suggests that the specific protein is a viable target for immunotherapeutic treatment of cancers and that a combination of this specific protein and checkpoint inhibitors would be an effective immunotherapy than with either agents alone. The inventors have identified, through knockout mice data and combinatorial use of checkpoint inhibitors, a new target for cancer therapy. The inhibition of the specific protein gives enhanced levels of TILs.",

Here, inventors discovered RA190, a biocompatible, irreversible small molecule proteasome inhibitor covalently binding a novel cellular target, namely proteasomal ubiquitin receptor RPN13. Importantly, RA190 efficiently induces p53-mediated and p53-independent apoptosis in refractory MM, cervical and ovarian cancer cell lines as well as their parental lines.

Despite SLM\u2019s unique and remarkable ability to produce metal parts with features and mechanical properties not achievable using conventional machining, quality assurance remains an open challenge in the metal 3D printing industry where the integrity of the produced parts highly depends on co-optimization of the powder composition, the part\u2019s geometry, and laser parameters. Traditionally, manufactured parts undergo expensive, and time consuming X-Ray scans during the post processing stage where defective parts are identified and discarded. Consequently and in anticipation of potential defects when developing new parts, manufacturers need to factor in additional machine time for reprints as they navigate the optimal settings. Recently there has been a growing interest in in-situ monitoring technologies which can detect defects and anomalies in real time, therefore saving valuable resources. Current in situ monitoring technologies either require major modifications to the industrial printers, or provide very basic information about the melt pool, limiting their ability to optimize the printer parameters. Therefore, there is a need for improved melt pool monitoring solutions, which are integrable, and which will allow for defects to be detected in real time. Technology Overview: Researchers at the Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory have developed an in-situ monitoring system capable of high speed, multi-spectral analysis of the melt pool during laser powder bed fusion. The hardware system which can be easily integrated into existing SLM machines provides a 3D digital print record of every part built. The analysis software provides point resolved extraction of the melt pool temperature and the data can be used to detect defects as they occur and optimize the laser parameters on the go.

    "ip_description": "As AI continues to integrate into medical imaging techniques, the ability to effectively utilize the millions of data points from those scans to effectuate future treatment innovations is critical. Radiomics is widely acknowledged for its potential impacts in inferring underlying patient conditions and accurately predicting patient outcomes, yet it is inherently hindered in a few regards. Variability in radiomics values may arise through: 1) data collection techniques from various imaging systems and their associated parameters; 2) an unaddressed standardization in how images are processed and subsequent computation of features; and finally, 3) a lack of uniformity in how radiomics models are reported. The need exists for a practical software solution that standardizes radiomics workflow, creates repeatable and impactful results across imaging modalities, and integrates into current processes with the potential to harness future AI innovations. The result would be a robust, streamlined process that supports physician decision-making and continually improves patient treatment and outcomes. Johns Hopkins researchers have created a software framework capable of predicting the mean and variability of radiomics based on an image's properties. The prediction framework is also used to recover measured radiomics to a ground truth value or the value measured from a different imaging protocol. Imaging modalities are diverse in their capabilities. Thus, this framework provides capabilities for linear imaging systems and systems where noise and resolution are calibratable, or even when there is limited knowledge of the model and the image-dependent noise/resolution. This software framework provides a predictive system that considers full system resolution and noise properties and promotes further standardization in medical imaging. Proof of concept.

Therapeutic endovascular embolization can be used to treat acute and potentially fatal bleeds to aneurysms, vascular malformations, and for targeted oncologic applications, such as the embolization of blood vessels supplying a tumor. Embolization devices include liquid embolics, microspheres, and platinum coils. Liquid embolics are expensive and require complex delivery procedures. Microspheres typically have a higher risk of non-target embolization. Although platinum coils are the safest, they are expensive and highly specific to the blood vessel size. Thus, there is a need for a new permanent embolization device that is affordable and versatile. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a low-cost polymer-based permanent embolization device that occludes a range of blood vessel sizes through expansion and thrombogenesis. The injectable material is a macroporous cryogel composite of alginate and polycaprolactone fibers, that allows the device to be compressed into a small volume with rapid re-expansion, while giving a high surface area to volume ratio for rapid blood vessel occlusion. Since the expansion allows the device to occlude vessels with a wide range of diameters, it significantly reduces the cost required to maintain the large and costly library of embolization coils needed for specific blood vessel sizes and applications. By relying on the expansion to fill the blood vessel, instead of a coil of a specific geometry, the one-size-fits-all embolization device has the potential to become the favored embolization device. Additionally, the device is easily modifiable, allowing for future applications in localized drug delivery, temporary occlusions to stiffen organs, and biosensing.",

    "published_date": "9/2/2021",
    "ip_description": "Insect evaluation has always had a very dated methodology for positioning done by entomologists and researchers. This evaluation is typically done through visual analysis, image capture and analysis, or PCR. Unfortunately, insects are fragile, especially those that are deceased and have dried out even before evaluation has taken place. In addition, tweezers, which are currently used to position insects, can injure or damage the specimen. Tweezers are also a tedious and time consuming instrument to use for insect positioning especially if there are hundreds of insects to evaluate. There is a need for static fields for capturing, manipulating, and killing live insects to be implemented to allow for more comprehensive, efficient, and accurate evaluation and analysis. In addition, there may be a need for static electricity to aid in placement and movement of deceased or immobile insects. Specific to the analysis, there is a need to manipulate the large numbers of deceased insects automatically. The inventors have proposed a method of utilizing static electricity to manipulate the transportation and positioning of deceased insects. They have proposed an electrostatic probe that has several mechanisms and modalities to address several unmet needs outlined above. There are three modalities for this to be used. The first area of use is to replace the need for tweezers by utilizing a static rod or wand that has applied static to a PCV rod and held near the ground to attract and place the mosquito/insect. The second modality is to create a surface with charged points that holds the insect there for imaging without visually obscuring the insect. The third embodiment is a larger surface with more charged points that would take into account a large number of insects that can be placed and dumped while also having a vibrational component that holds them into place by attracting them to a charged point. This allows an even spread of individual mosquitoes for image capture and classification, contributing to the growth in research of automated tracking of single insects in a large number of insect groups. As assumed, these modalities address several unmet needs regarding efficiency, ease in technique, preserving insect bodies, and automated tracking of insects.",

In addition, the inventors are able to fabricate CQD LEDs on flexible substrates or curved glass surfaces, describing their starting materials as paints as opposed to brittle crystals. These would be suited for building a flexible and transparent membrane-based LED array due to the following properties. The proposed CQD LEDs would have emission wavelength tunability between 800-2000 nm, flexibility with a thickness of under 1 micrometer allowing them to be ultra-lightweight, and transparency that is impossible to achieve with conventional LEDs as stated above.

    "ip_description": "Real-Time, Interventional Guidance for Tumor Detection and Excision JHU REF: C12934\n\nInvention Novelty: A novel optical method for the identification and differentiation of tumor versus non-tumor tissue with direct visual cue for use in real-time, continuous and noninvasive guidance for tumor excision.\n\nValue Proposition: Approximately 13,000 brain cancer surgeries are performed in the US each year, with surgery being the first-line therapy for brain cancer. Evidence has indicated that the extent of tumor resection is the only modifiable risk factor associated with survival and cancer recurrence. In an attempt to improve the accuracy of total tumor resection and prevent recurrence, reoperation, and potential collateral damage to healthy eloquent brain tissue, this technology uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantitatively identify and differentiate tumor from non-tumor brain tissue. Although it is a relatively new imaging modality, OCT is fast gaining popularity and has established applications in oncology, neurosurgery, and endoscopy. OCT is used to identify the optical properties of various tissue types, differentiate the tissue in real time, provide a color-coded map of the image, and assist physicians in excising tumors. The advantages of this technology are:\n- It can be customized and used on tumors of various origins (different organ systems) in addition to brain tumor\n- Generates a color-coded map of the tissue, clearly differentiating tumor from non-tumor tissue\n- Differentiates vital blood vessels and ventricles, reducing the incidence of vessel injury during surgery\n- Minimize the risk of resection healthy particularly eloquent brain tissues and thus minimize the risk of functional morbidity caused by surgery.\n\nTechnical Details: Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel optical-based system that can quantitatively differentiate tumor from non-tumor tissue based on optical attenuation values of the tissue. By performing multiple scans and custom algorithms, the system can be standardized to the tissue system of choice, thus enabling the use of the system on different organ systems. The optical properties are used to generate a 2D color-coded map of the tissue, which is lain over the image of the tissue. The system can produce maps in real-time, thus enabling interventional guidance during tumor excision procedures.\n\nLooking for Partners: To develop and commercialize the technology as a tumor diagnosis and differentiation technique for use in interventional procedures and surgeries.\n\nStage of Development: Phase 0 Clinical Students (with more than 30 patients imaged during brain cancer surgery).",

    "ip_number": "C16832",
    "published_date": "8/27/2021",
    "ip_description": "It is estimated that, in 2020, 1,806,590 people were diagnosed with cancer and 606,520 people will die from the disease (see NCI). Nevertheless, there are a limited number of molecular diagnostic methods that are routinely deployed in clinical practice. Although the amount of ctDNA is dependent on tumor stage, size, tumor type, among other factors, studies have shown that, using 4.0-7.5 mL of plasma, ctDNA is undetectable in nearly 50% of stage I cancer patients. While the sensitivity of detecting ctDNA in early-stage cancers is woefully low, there is agreement that analysis of ctDNA provides an opportunity to noninvasively detect all stages of cancer, track tumor burden, and monitor response to treatment. The limiting factor in using blood based liquid biopsies for early cancer detection and screening is the volume of blood required to extract a measurable number of ctDNA copies. An apheresis machine is a device that can draw whole blood, separate the blood components, and infuse the blood components back into the individual. This device provides the opportunity to screen large volumes of plasma without extracting it from the body. However, current DNA capture technologies requires the plasma to be chemically treated before the ctDNA can be capture. The dCas9 capture system is the first technology designed to capture ctDNA from flowing unaltered plasma. Inventors at Johns Hopkins University have developed a method that uses dCas9 to capture ctDNA from flowing unaltered plasma. Since the dCas9 capture system does not require the plasma to be chemically treated, the screened plasma can be returned to the patient, which allows for larger volumes of plasma to be screened than can be extracted. Furthermore, since only ctDNA is selectively captured, this method allows for other analytical methods \u2013 such as proteomics \u2013 to be performed on the same aliquot of plasma. The inventors have conducted proof-of-concept experiments by capturing the BRAF (T1799A) DNA mutation spiked into blood plasma. The number of captured mutant BRAF DNA was quantified using qPCR. To test the performance of the dCas9 capture system, a range of mutant allele fractions (MAF) (MAF 35%/150copies, MAF 10%/40 copies, and MAF 1%/4 copies) were captured using the commercially available Zymo cfDNA extraction kit and the dCas9 capture system. Compared to the results of the Zymo cfDNA extraction kit, the dCas9 capture system was able to capture, on average, between 101% and 117% of the mutant BRAF DNA. Furthermore, the dCas9 system enriched the mutant BRAF DNA on average between 1.8 and 3.3-fold higher in comparison to the off-target capture of ACTB. In a similar proof-of-concept experiment, using sgRNA specific to pro-viral HIV and 16S DNA from Staphylococcus aureus, the dCas9 capture system showed capture enrichment of 3.9 and 6.5-fold more than the nonspecific control ACTB DNA. This demonstrates the versatility of the technology beyond cancer detection in the area of infectious disease. Furthermore, the dCas9 capture system, with its current setup, cost less than the commercially available Zymo cfDNA extraction kit ($5.30 with dCas9 capture vs. $6.54 with Zymo cfDNA kit, per sample). In an experiment to show that the dCas9 system can capture ctDNA in flowing unaltered plasma, 6ml of plasma at MAF 10%, was pumped across the dCas9 system at 6ml/min for 5min, 10min, 20min, 40min, and 80min. It was shown that the number of dCas9 captured mutant BRAF DNA copies doubled with time (slope = -1.035 Ct) and is highly linear (R2= 0.874). To increase the sensitivity of the dCas9 capture system, the inventors are currently optimizing a dCas9 specific microfluidic device.",

The number of cases and deaths increase each day. Various animal models have been used to study COVID-19 with varying susceptibility due to species-specific differences in the ACE2 receptor, the primary binding site of SARS-CoV-2 on infected cells (Johanesen, et al., 2020). Currently, there is no comprehensive mouse model that fully represents all aspects of COVID-19 in humans (Mu\u00f1oz-Fontela, et al., 2020). As COVID-19 spreads, SARS-CoV-2 mutations continue to arise, driving enhanced virulence and transmissibility (CDC, 2021). To adequately respond to this present threat and prepare for future outbreaks, there is a strong need for dynamic as well as an adaptable murine models that facilitate critical research needed for pathogenesis studies and the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents in biosafety level 2 facilities.

    "ip_description": "About 400,000 to 460,000 people die each year from sudden cardiac death (SCD). Patients with Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) are at increased risk for heart failure and SCD triggered by exercise. Common ACM driver mutations occur in about 1 out of every 10,000 people. However, the physiological mechanisms that drive myocardial loss and lead to heart failure in ACM patients are not well known. Current standard of care for ACM patients seeks to manage the symptoms and to prevent SCD such as through activity restriction or implantable cardiac devices, rather than address the underlying pathological drivers of ACM progression. Thus, there is an imperative need for therapeutic targets that could treat ACM and improve patient outcome. The Johns Hopkins inventors have identified the AIF/thioredoxin-2 signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target for ACM patients. The novel mechanism reveals that enhanced levels of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocating into the nucleus is associated with increased myocyte death. This translocation is prompted by altered redox balance in ACM hearts that is exacerbated by exercise. Inhibition of binding of AIF to nuclear chaperones that mediate translocation by AIF peptide mimetics prevents myocyte cell death. Discovery of this pathway, and its implications in ACM pathophysiology, expands the space of druggable targets to slow myocardial loss and progression of ACM. The inventors have studied this mechanism in a mouse model of ACM. They have identified and tested a set of peptides that have pharmacologic activity to disrupt the AIF/thioredoxin-2 signaling pathway.",

Viral-mediated gene therapy has seen some clinical success, including the recent FDA approval of therapeutics for retinal dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy.

Lipid nanoparticles can be used as safe, alternative carriers for transgene delivery, but their utility has been limited by poor transfection efficiency. In addition, there are currently no large-scale production methods for generating stable, off-the-shelf DNA/lipid particles of consistent quality. Therefore, there is a strong need to identify mechanisms that increase the transfection efficiency of DNA/lipid nanoparticles and to develop production methods that improve product yield and consistency. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have identified the optimal size of plasmid DNA/lipid particles required for efficient cell transfection. In addition, they have developed scalable methods for size-specific nanoparticle assembly, based on kinetic control of particle aggregation. This technology allows for large-scale preparation of shelf-stable nanoparticles of a defined size, which can be tailored within a range. These methods can streamline manufacturing, increase yields, and improve quality in the industrial production of nanoparticle-based gene therapies with enhanced transfection efficiency and reproducibility.

Severe peripheral nerve injury is customarily treated with nerve autograft, yet only about half of patients achieve satisfactory motor recovery, with even less (42.6%), experiencing satisfactory sensory recovery. Additionally, autologous nerve grafting often results in comorbidities at the donor site. Current strategies for treating PNIs have many shortcomings and need to be improved to increase rate of successful recovery. Johns Hopkins researchers have shown that increased expression of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1) in macrophages improves peripheral nerve regeneration after injury in mice. Furthermore, they have demonstrate that the injection of bone marrow-derived macrophages in MCT1-deficient mice can improve nerve recovery. These findings suggest that engineered macrophages may pose as potential cell-therapies for PNIs and potentially other peripheral nerve disorders.

    "ip_description": "Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for bone growth and mineral accrual. Bone mass and strength in this period are influenced by genetic/epigenetic factors, activity, nutrition, and hormones. For children with genetic skeletal disorders or chronic disease, bone growth and mineral accrual are often compromised, leading to osteoporosis and large number bone fractures. Osteoporosis during childhood development is divided into primary and secondary causes, with osteogenesis imperfecta representing primary osteoporosis. Secondary pediatric osteoporosis caused by underlying diseases and/or their treatment fall into two broad categories: 1) glucocorticoid-induced disease and 2) weight-bearing or mobility disorders.\n\nGlucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. Long-term treatment with glucocorticoids has been widely used in the management of chronic inflammatory childhood illnesses. Despite improved outcomes and survival rates, there can be substantial adverse effects on general bone health and growth. Epidemiological studies revealed that children and young adults with long-term exposure to glucocorticoid therapy are subject to a ~34% prevalence for vertebral fractures. To date, no treatment modality exists that can protect healthy bone growth and mineral accrual during childhood glucocorticoid treatment.\n\nJohns Hopkins researchers identified and characterized a selective H3K27 demethylase inhibitor for the therapeutic treatment of pediatric and juvenile osteoporosis induced by glucocorticoid therapy. Using mouse models, the investigators discovered that the normal programmed senescence of bone mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells is under the epigenetic control of the histone methyltransferase enhancer, Ezh2, and its methylation of histone H3, H3K27.\n\nThe researchers found that the deletion of the Ezh2 methyltransferase gene induced premature cellular senescence during early puberty, which led to osteogenesis and late bone loss. Similarly in normal mice during early puberty, treatment with glucocorticoids induced early cellular senescence in the long bone. The inventors describe a treatment method that uses the H3K27-specific demethylase inhibitor, GSK-J4, which elevates H3K27 methylation and subsequently blocks the early onset of cellular senescence and rescues the bone-loss phenotype induced by glucocorticoid treatment.",

Thus, it is of an urgent need to identify treatments to protect against these cognitive effects, as delaying surgical procedures and forgoing anesthesia are not viable options for these cases. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have shown that a single dose of Molsidomine prevents cognitive impairment and plasticity defects in the hippocampus following inhaled anesthesia. Molsidomine is a nitric oxide (NO) donor and counteracts the effects of anesthesia-related disruptions to the PDZ domain-mediated protein-protein interactions. Disruptions in these protein-protein interactions lead to changes in dendritic spine morphology, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function, as measured by histological changes, long term potentiation and recognition memory.

    "ip_description": "Every year, around 200,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Currently, a ruptured AAA is the 15th leading cause of death in the country. All techniques of repairing AAA utilize the addition of an aortic stent graft to fix the rupture. One of the newer techniques is to attach a graft after extending the proximal landing zone by artificially \u201celevating\u201d the orifice of the renal arteries. This procedure is done by placing fabric covered grafts inside the renal arteries, which will create a longer landing zone where the proximal body of the aortic endograph can land. This technique has been called the \u201cchimney\u201d technique. However, this technique contains the presence of gutters that are inadvertently created when round objects are placed adjacent to each other in a round enclosure. These gutters can allow blood flow to continue to enter the aneurysm sac, which will cause continued expansion of the aneurysm. Thus, there is a need for a way to stop gutter creation so that blood flow into the aneurysm sac will cease. The inventors have created a method to eliminate gutter leaks through a unique mechanism of external scales oriented against the direction of blood flow. These scales are incorporated into the main body of an aortic stent graft, specifically the proximal aspect. As the grain of each scale is oriented to oppose the direction of flow, any gap between the graft and the blood vessel will cause the scales to unfurl, impeding blood flow. If a graft is particularly long, several rows of small scales would be present, with each row of scales offset relative to the next row. This would result in proper impedance of blood flow.",

    "ip_description": "Perfusion is the method in which blood is delivered to tissue in animals. All animal tissues require adequate supplies of blood for sustained health and life. However, there are many surgeries and procedures that can decrease adequate perfusion. For example, critical limb ischemia (CLI), which affects more than 2 million people in the United States today, requires a surgical procedure called revascularization that can compromise perfusion in the affected limb. Monitoring perfusion post-operatively is extremely important after modern revascularization surgery as it requires complex distal endovascular procedures. Monitoring perfusion adequately reduces the risk of the patient requiring surgery again, and in extreme cases, limb amputation. Thus, there is a need in the field for a post-operative perfusion monitoring platform. The inventors have designed a device that is a portable pulse volume recorder. The device may consist of a removable anklet with an inflatable bladder, air pump, and electronics. The anklet may be fabricated with a flexible material containing solid components for the electronics and air pump. The device would be worn following a vascular or endovascular intervention for the purposes of intermittently monitoring of limb perfusion. The integrated bladder is programmed to inflate and deflate at preset cycles, which can be changed manually if required. This recorder will allow for remote monitoring of limb perfusion after revascularization and will be Bluetooth or Wi-Fi enabled. Thus, when the anklet captures pulse volume information, the cuff will deflate and the data will be sent wirelessly to a local Bluetooth enabled receiver, such as a smart phone or computer. This receiver will then forward the information to the practitioner\u2019s database, where it can be analyzed without the need for the patient\u2019s physical presence in the hospital. This also has the potential to solve hurdles patients face regarding frequent follow-ups, accessibility of testing, and convenience following revascularization procedures.

Through this method, blood flows into the aneurysum, sparing the patient paraplegia. It also allows time to optimize conditions in order to augment spinal cord perfusion.

Aortic aneurysms that involve larger vessels pose extremely challenging problems for vascular surgeons. Almost all the vessels that branch out from the aneurysm will require revascularization, but it is very rare that all the vessels can be covered and sacrificed during the repair of an aortic aneurysm. Performing an endovascular repair of an aneurysm spanning the aortic vessels currently requires complex open operative \u201cde-branching\u201d procedures. As de-branching is an invasive major operation, performing endovascular repair of aneurysms is very difficult to do and can lead to a plethora of possible errors. Thus, there is a need for a way to repair aortic aneurysms through minimally invasive procedures. The inventors have developed a novel type of aortic graft. The invention is a fenestrated graft that allows for simple placement of either single or multiple side branch grafts in any location. Additionally, the graft does not require custom manufacturing and is designed to be readily usable. The fenestrations for side branch placement can be accessed from either the external surface of the graft or from a retrograde approach. The graft will span the entire aneurysm, and the lumen of the graft can be accessed through a wire from the closest arm. A branch graft will then be deployed across the shingled graft, re-establishing flow to the left subclavian artery while maintaining exclusion of the aortic aneurysm. This stent graft can also be used with any commercially available balloon expandable side branch graft, increasing its diversity and usability. The invention is currently in the prototyping stage.",

Both types of surgeries rely on the ability of the surgeon to restore blood flow into blocked vessels. In open surgery, flow is usually re-established by bypassing the areas of blockage. Bypassing utilizes conduits that are comprised of either native veins or grafts that are formed from synthetic materials and shaped into tubular forms. In vascular surgery, the conduit and the native blood vessel that is being bypassed are sown together by hand. This hand sewing technique is tedious and very technically challenging. Thus, there is a need for a way to mechanically connect the conduit and the native blood vessels that is more rapid and has greater ease of use. The inventors have created a device that allows anastomosis to be quickly and easily created between two hollow structures, such as native and artificial blood vessels. The device consists of two hollow disk magnets with notched cutouts, created in a custom length and shape. The magnets are then clipped to the artery or vein, and, as they are made with stiff material, they hold their proper form. Alternatively, the magnetic attachment element could be secured to a short graft segment and mated to a prefabricated, magnetized graft. The third and final embodiment is a device in which the clips themselves are magnetic and are placed around the perimeter of the vessel lumen. The clipped vessels are then mated to form an anastomosis. The technology is currently in the ideation and prototyping phase.",

The first embodiment consists of a PD catheter with integrated magnets along its length. The integrated magnets will adhere to an anchoring magnet, placed in the abdominal wall. The anchoring magnet can be placed either laparoscopically or percutaneously. This results in secure and reliable positioning of the catheter, with a reversible fixation of the drain if required. If the PD catheter moves out of position, an external magnet can re-position it easily. The second embodiment of the invention is for PD catheters that are inserted without the magnetic attachment. The inventors have created a supplementary invention that is a magnetic insert which is advanced into the lumen of the PD catheter to its most distal point. The insert is fitted with neodymium magnets that attract to an external magnetic source, which can serve for catheter repositioning.",

The procedures commence with needle localization, where the radiologist inserts a needle into the breast lesion of interest. New localization procedures are being developed, but although these procedures mark the lesion within the breast, the ideal incision location and approach tract for the surgeon is not made obvious. Thus, there is a need for a method by which to locate and clearly mark the lesion in the breast for accurate removal. Inventors have created an invention that is a dual lumen needle, allowing an interventionalist to mark both the breast lesion as well as the approach tract. The needle allows the target mass in the breast to be marked in a different color of fluorescent ink than the tract, which simplifies identification of the breast target. The design of the needle may include two lumens and two ports, or may be comprised of a single lumen with coaxial end-hole and side-hole needles, depending upon the procedure and the location of the malignancy.

    "ip_description": "More than 23% of all adults are thought to be affected by varicose veins. These veins are enlarged and swollen as a result of faulty valves that allow blood to flow in the wrong direction. Currently, varicose veins are managed through the application of a compression garment such as a stocking. The garments help prevent veins from being engorged by applying external compression to distended veins. The compression stockings are created with different compression levels and lengths to suit the needs of different patients. However, the most common complaint for compression stockings is that they are uncomfortable and do not fit well, even with these extra measures taken. This occurs because varicose veins occur in certain areas in the legs, but the compression is exerted uniformly. Thus, there is a need for a way to provide targeted compression to more effectively support and treat varicose veins. The inventors have created a lighter weight compression stocking with one or more strategically placed pockets or fenestrations through which compression pads can be introduced. The pads will be placed under the stocking to enhance pressure at only specific locations. These locations will be dependent upon each patient and will target areas such as those overlying bothersome varicose veins prior to intervention, or sites of sclerotherapy or phlebectomy. Through these targeted pads, the unaffected areas will have less compression, decreasing the amount of discomfort that the patients feel. The insert pads can be created from a variety of hypoallergenic materials and will be customizable. The inventors will try and test two variations. One is the pocket variation, where the pads can be custom inserts into a pocket. The other is a fenestration variation with no pockets, but instead slits in the fabric which will allow the insertion of pads. The invention is currently in the prototyping phase.",

In order for long-term applicability of hemodialysis, either arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) or arteriovenous grafts (AVG) are utilized. AVFs utilize the patient\u2019s own vein and AVGs are artificial conduits that allow long-term access to the patient\u2019s blood flow and supply. AVFs require at least 2-3 months of maturation time prior to needle access in order to allow the vein to increase caliber. Alternatively, AVGs require at least 3-4 weeks to allow the surrounding tissue to adhere to the external surface. During the maturation period, the patient is unable to undergo dialysis due to the high risk of complications. However, many patients require immediate and early dialysis, and the current early access AVGs on the market have poor handling characteristics. They degrade quickly and do not last as long as conventional grafts. Thus, there is a need for a better, more durable graft so that patients can be dialyzed early and safely. The inventors have created a novel hybrid graft that allows for early accessibility and longevity through accurate puncture of small targets on the AV graft comprised of early puncture fabric. After the maturation time, the early access areas will be abandoned, and the rest of the graft will be used for access. The graft will be mostly compromised of conventional puncture graft fabric. The early puncture fabric will be coated with a fluorescent pigment. After implantation of the graft, when dialysis is required, the coated graft segment will be located with black light, allowing accurate access of the early puncture graft. As it will be easy to differentiate between graft components, the smallest possible area of the early puncture graft will be utilized, thus reserving the majority of the graft for the more resilient conventional graft fabric. The inventors also believe that this photo-assisted targeting mechanism can be integrated into implantable ports, which could aid in the delivery of chemotherapeutics. Chemotherapy is usually administered through subcutaneous ports, and this invention would make percutaneous access more accurate, and less prone to complications.",

Over time, shunts start to clot, and require additional procedures in order to restore function. As areas of shunt degradation or malfunction are often multifocal, two shunt access points oriented in opposite directions are usually required to properly treat malfunctions. However, this orientation creates many logistical challenges for the surgeon, such as increasing procedural time, radiation exposure, sedation time, risk of wire contamination, and costs. Thus, there is a need for a way to access and treat shunt degradation with decreased risks and costs. The inventors have created a device that can help decrease costs and risks in hemodialysis shunt placement procedures. The invention is a curved member that allows directional deflection of any flexible endovascular device. The member is not a sheath, but rather a conduit through which flexible endovascular devices can be redirection up to 180 degrees. The inventors envision this device as being used at one access site when two shunt access sites are oriented in opposite directions. The device guide will allow the interventionalist performing the procedure to work with their dominant hand, and the curved member will allow both sheaths to be introduced from the same direction. Advantages of such an invention include: improved organization of a site, decreased risk of contamination, decreased number of procedures required, reduced radiation administered, and reduced sedation time for patient.",

    "ip_description": "Nearly 750,000 patients in the United States per year require hemodialysis. In order to achieve hemostasis after percutaneous hemodialysis interventions, purse string sutures are routinely utilized. A purse string suture is sewn with a particular pattern so that the beginning and end of the suture strand lie close together. Days or weeks after placement, the sutures will require removal. However, the removal procedure can be very painful for patients as the tightly knotted suture can become partially buried in the patient skin and can cause unpleasant pinching upon removal. Local anesthetic is occasionally required for the removal procedure. There are other makeshift techniques that have been proposed to ease suture removal, such as securing a purse string over a spacer, but these techniques are less secure and still require formal suture removal. Thus, there is a need for a way to make purse string suture removal easier and less for patients. The inventors have created a device designed to secure a purse string suture in place without needing to knot the strands, allowing for easier, less painful removal. The invention is called a cinch and is made up of one solid piece of material with no moving parts. The free tails of the purse string suture are put through the cinch, which anchors and secures the strands, maintaining hemostatic tension without the use of a knot. The cinch will provide pressure directly onto the puncture site to stop bleeding. After application, the cinch can be left in place for hours or days prior to being removed. The device can easily and painlessly be released and removed when the suture is no longer needed. The simplicity of the cinch also allows the sutures to be removed by any able-bodied person, which eliminates the need for follow-up visits to practitioners.",

Automation has become the standard across many industries; however, due to the uncertainty and irregularities of surgical procedures, automation has not become a suitable option. Introducing surgeon supervised automation into medical robotics can help to lower this error rate by lowering the responsibilities of the surgeon during the procedure to fine controls during the procedure. This can be achieved via a dynamic interaction with the human user and informing them about the control modes in next steps of surgery. This leaves a need for a surgical system which can leverage the repeatability of automation with the fine skills of surgeons. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed a supervised-autonomous platform for automatic suturing within surgical procedures. This platform is capable of fully autonomous suture placement with an accuracy of 85.4% and supervised placement at an accuracy of 98.1%, as well as 1.6 times better consistency in suture spacing and 1.8 times better consistency in suture bite sizes than the manual results.

Using a cis Nf1+/-\u037eTp53+/- (NPcis) mouse model of NF1, researchers show substantially delayed formation of solid malignancies and significantly increased median survival in mice given the drug. In addition to overall increase in survival and reduction of malignant tumor formation, treatment with the drug also showed a reduction in size of benign tumors in the mice.

    "ip_description": "Unmet Need: Brain imaging techniques are commonly used to visualize the distribution of tissues and fluids within the skull. These techniques are classically used to either (1) diagnose abnormalities in the structure of the brain (traumatic brain injury, stroke, tumors, abnormal fluid buildup, etc.) or (2) provide a real-time visual aid for surgeons and physicians providing neurosurgical care. Ultrasound is one of the most accurate and cost-effective transcranial imaging methods, with alternatives like CT scans or MRIs sometimes costing more than two-to-four times as much, depending on the healthcare service provider. Nevertheless, ultrasound is not a viable option for imaging the brain for most adults because the technique cannot penetrate the skull. As a result, CT scans are typically used for brain imaging of adults, with ultrasound techniques limited for use during neurosurgery. In addition, the burr hole cover has a small footprint (ie. just 14 millimeters wide) which limits the viewpoint from a handheld transducer, and thus, an additional \u201clens\u201d effect built within easily helps to overcome this obstacle. As such, there is a need for methods that enable non-invasive brain imaging of adults by ultrasound and implant lens, thereby, lower of the cost of care for patients with suspected or existing brain injuries.

Burr holes are standard components of most neurological, ears/nose/throat, orthopedic, maxillofacial, plastic, and some ocular surgeries. The invention enables and enhances the non-invasive use of ultrasound brain imaging in post-operative adult patients, thereby allowing physicians to more cost-effectively make diagnostic and therapeutic determinations for patients.

    "ip_description": "Effective radiation treatment of tumors combines maximal radiation dose delivery to planned locations while mitigating radiation impacts on surrounding normal tissues. A delivery of radiation absorption materials (biocompatible gels) to create pockets of radiation dissipation has proven to be an effective method to mask unwanted effects. Most injection procedures are performed under passive ultrasound, or x-ray guidance as MRI guided injections are material limiting and inefficient in procedural timing. If a needle were to exist that was MRI-compatible, comparable in mechanical properties to non-MRI compatible needles, and allowed for active tracking of needlepoint to the target area, accuracy in dose delivery could be improved. Other areas to benefit from this technology could be cryoblation techniques, chemotherapy agent deployments, and embolization practices. The reported invention is an MR-tracked injection needle formed by concentric titanium tubes with a bevel-shaped cutting tip. The area between the tubes is where MR-tracking coils are located, along with signal-transmitting micro axial cables. This allows for distal end location and orientation tracking. The proximal end contains electrical circuits to optimize the tracking signal and is connected to a syringe (for radiation gel injection) and to a quick-disconnect electrical connection that allows for the transfer of the MR Tracking signals to receivers of the MRI scanners. 'Longer' injection needles may require MBalun overlays at prescribed distances along the shaft to prevent radio-frequency induced heating of the titanium shaft. This device aims to provide efficient and precise gel delivery with quantifiable topology and volume results. This approach's immediate design targets center on trans-perineal gel injections used during HDR or LDR Brachytherapy (BT) for the treatment of cervical and prostate cancers. Similar designs may be used for injection of various agents into vascular and soft-tissue spaces. A slight variation could be utilized for suction practices (biopsy purposes). Examples: cryoblation, chemotherapy agent deployment, embolization. Inventors have tested 30 cm long prototypes in female swine models, demonstrating the ability to rapidly bring the needle tip under MR-tracked guidance to soft tissue pockets between the cervix/endometrium and the rectum, and to dynamically visualize the volume and shape of the pockets with real-time MR Imaging during injection of MR-visible contrasts into these pockets, allowing the shaping of pockets that can significantly reduce rectum irradiation. Thermal testing of these prototypes in 1.5 Tesla scanners was also completed, meeting ASTM 2182-19 heating limits for MRI-conditional devices.",

Johns Hopkins researchers have invented a method to prevent and treat COVID-19, caused by pandemic SARS-CoV-2, as well as infections caused by seasonal coronaviruses, such as HCoV-OC43. They propose the use of sulforaphane (SF), a natural compound derived from cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli, kale, etc.), for COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Their in vitro experiments showed that SF inhibits the replication of six strains of SARS-CoV-2, including Omicron, as well as HCoV-OC43. Further, SF given to mice prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 decreased viral load in the respiratory tract and reduced pulmonary pathology caused by the virus infection. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of SF to be a relatively inexpensive, widely available prophylactic and therapeutic agent against COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections. This technology is under pre-clinical development.",

    "ip_description": "The WHO has predicted that neurological disorders (NDs) will become the second leading cause of death in 20 years after cardiovascular diseases. Various proteins have been identified to aggregate and accumulate in the brain depending on the indication: amyloid-beta or tau in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, alpha-synuclein in Parkinson\u2019s disease, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Despite all the knowledge accumulated on topic, NDs remain incurable and have quickly become one of the largest public health problems. There is a consensus that the key event common to NDs is the misfolding, oligomerization, and accumulation of protein in the brain. Phenotype screening has emerged as a powerful technique because they may represent a more holistic model of disease states as opposed to biochemical screens, however there has not been a reproducible technique that mimics protein aggregation. These phenotype screens are paramount for therapeutic purposes, and there is an increasing need to find novel drugs which can abate or slow down the course of NDs. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed optogenetics-assisted method of alpha-synuclein aggregation induction system (OASIS). This technology presents a model for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) for candidate drug screening; as the field has struggled to attain a model of PD that reproducibly exhibits \u03b1-synuclein oligomerization and aggregation. The inventors successfully evaluated OASIS in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, to effectively mimic the phenotype of PD. The invention provides a platform to screen candidate drug molecules in a high-throughput fashion for PD. One of the applications of OASIS is to perform a phenotypic screening in human neurons, to identify potential drug candidates that can reduce/delay the pathogenic forms of alpha-synuclein aggregates. The inventors have optimized the protocol and has finished a small-scale pilot screening (~1,200 small molecules), which led to the identification of two promising candidates that can decrease the levels of pathogenic alpha synuclein aggregates, and also rescue the human dopaminergic neuronal cell death. Currently, the inventors are in the process of performing a larger-scale compound screen, with ~10,000 small molecules.",

    "ip_description": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) affects as many as 30,000 people in the United States alone, with 5,000 new cases diagnosed every year. ALS is a fatal neuromuscular disease that is characterized by a progressive degeneration of the motor nerve cells and spinal cord. There are only two drugs approved by FDA for the treatment of ALS, and both treatments are designed to slow the progression of the disease. About 10% of ALS cases are inherited and over 20 mutated genes have now been recognized as markers of familial ALS. However, the other 90% of ALS cases are sporadic and caused by unknown factors. Given the huge unmet therapeutic need in this field, there is an urgent demand for effective treatments for ALS patients. Johns Hopkins researchers have identified the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway, involved in lipid metabolism, as a novel therapeutic target against ALS. They performed transcriptomics and metabolomics studies to identify common metabolic perturbations in both inherited and sporadic ALS spinal motor neurons (sMNs), and discovered that AA levels were aberrantly high in ALS sMNs. Pharmacological inhibition of AA metabolism by the treatment of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitor reduced AA level, which was sufficient to reverse ALS-related phenotypes in both in vitro human sMN and in vivo Drosophila models. These findings suggest that AA metabolism may be a source of promising drug targets for both familial and sporadic ALS cases, and 5-LOX inhibitors could potentially be developed as therapeutics against ALS. The inventors are pursuing further testing of 5-LOX inhibitors as therapeutics in ALS models.",

For surgeries on the brain, ears, eyes, nose, or throat, biometric imaging data are heavily relied upon in order to diagnose and monitor intracranial pathologies. MRI and CT scans are only intermittently available, are expensive, and do not provide ongoing real-time monitoring during the post-operative period when complications are most likely to emerge. Furthermore, CT scans emit ionizing radiation, which may be harmful to patients requiring long-term post-operative monitoring. Hand held, external, and wireless diagnostic ultrasounds are safe and available for general clinical use for long-term surveillance, but these devices are neither implantable nor MRI compatible and do not provide real-time monitoring.

This device contains a wireless data transmitter and can be customized to fit a cranial prosthetic. The device can generate and transmit wireless, non-ionizing ultrasound images and biometric data (pressure, blood flow, etc.) on demand, providing continuous details about the intracranial space to physicians. The ultrasonic frequency can also be reprogrammed remotely in order to image different tissue depths. In contrast to expensive, time consuming, and not readily available MRI and CT radiographs, this device provides a means for real-time, non-ionizing, continuous, and remote post-operative monitoring and long-term surveillance of the intracranial space.

Current image segmentation involves cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with contrast enhancement (i.e. late gadolinium LGE). Identifying scarring through image segmentation is challenging, as the process can be manual and tedious with low generalizability. There is a strong need for a more automated method of identifying scarring to limit the burden on physicians and technicians and more accurately aid preventative identification markers of SCD. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a novel Anatomical Convolutional Segmentation Network or \u201cACSNet\u201d technology, which is a fully automated approach that can identify myocardium and fibrosis in LGE-CMR images. This technology is capable of improving the image data leading to enhanced anatomical accuracy and proper handling of ambiguous regions such as the apex and base. The invention additionally enables clinical use by ensuring robust applicability across different CMR modalities, scar distributions arising from different heart pathologies, and different imaging centers.

There is thus a critical need to develop innovative methodologies to rationally and precisely engineer the glycosylation profiles of protein drugs to create new therapeutics, improve their pharmacologic properties, and facilitate manufacturing.\n\nTechnical Details: Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed an integrated technology platform to glycoengineer protein-based drugs to improve therapeutic properties, manufacturability, and efficacy. This comprehensive platform can introduce N-linked glycosylation sites into protein drug candidates, generate engineered drug variants with bespoke glycosylation patterns using genetically modified cell lines, and enhance production using proprietary hexosamine analogues that increase the overall consistency and efficacy of glycosylation-modified drug candidates. Central to this process, the platform utilizes a cell line that is responsible for the majority of therapeutic protein production, including virtually all therapeutic antibodies; these cells are genetically modified to improve N-glycan branching, sialylation, and additional aspects of glycan biosynthesis for precise regulation of glycosylation. This system has been demonstrated for the production of bioengineered antibodies and for enzyme replacement therapy with optimized safety, stability, yield, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties.

    "ip_description": "Lyme disease is one of many tick-transmitted diseases. Further investigation has revealed that Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdoferi. These bacteria transmit to humans via an infected deer tick and has affected over 25,000 Americans in the United States in 2002. Currently there are estimated to be 300,000 cases a year in the U.S. The current standard treatment with 2-4 week doxycycline antibiotic treatment cures Lyme disease in 80-90% of the patients. However, about 10-20% of patients develop persisting symptoms of fatigue, pain, and neurological symptoms despite the standard antibiotic treatment, a condition called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Current methods lack sensitivity for early stage Lime disease, where the diagnostic symptom is an EM rash, which is not conclusively demonstrated in all patients with Lyme disease. To improve the sensitivity of the current Lyme diagnosis other antigens may be supplemented with a peptide. The inventors prepared antigens from different forms of B. burgdorferi i.e., log phase spirochetes (LOG), stationary phase planktonic form (spirochete and round body) (SP) and biofilm-like microcolony form (MC) from stationary phase cultures, as well as water\u2013induced round bodies, and compared their utility to diagnose Lyme disease using well characterized patient samples in a two stage design. Importantly, the inventors found that only the MC derived persister antigens (MPA) significantly improved the sensitivity of diagnosis of Lyme disease compared with the aforementioned antigens or peptide. Studies with the MPA were utilized moving forward using a second set of 140 blinded serum samples with known early Lyme or PTLDS from Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Center SLICE studies. MPA in combination with peptide enhanced the sensitivity of diagnosis for both early Lyme and PTLDS patients. The inventors have demonstrated increased sensitivity using microcolonies of the Borrelia burgdoferi persister antigens with and without peptide in patient serum samples. Moreover, the finding of more PTLDS patients reacting with MPA serves as a potential biomarker for PTLDS. The inventors are currently elucidating the exact antigens responsible for the improved sensitivity.",

Fluid enters the cysts via a cAMP-dependent process involving the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the luminal membrane of cysts in ADPKD patients. Disclosed herein is the use of CFTR-modulators for the treatment of ADPKD. Johns Hopkins researchers have discovered a new use for CFTR modulators for the treatment of ADPKD. Inventors observed a significant inhibition of growth in cysts grown in cell culture, both in the presence or absence of the cAMP-activator Forskolin. Importantly, a CFTR modulator already approved for use in CF patients, reduced cyst growth and improved renal function in several mouse models of ADPKD. Interestingly, the CFTR modulator increases the expression of CFTR in the basolateral cell membrane of the cysts and restores a network of proteostatic proteins that when misregulated contribute to cyst growth. Together, this invention uncovered a promising new strategy for the use of CFTR correctors either alone, or possibly in combination for the treatment of ADPKD.

Currently, the primary diagnostic for cervical cancer is a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear. If the Pap smear is positive; HPV genotyping diagnostics, a colposcopy, and/or a biopsy are used as confirmation. However, Pap smears and HPV infection tests do not distinguish between lesions that will progress to an invasive carcinoma and those that will not. This current technology is advantageous as it is; - Non-invasive, which reduces the risk of infection or inflammation. - Will potentially aid in the clinical management of HPV-positive/Pap-negative women. - It is potentially a more sensitive test to monitor progression from no malignancy to cervical cancer. - Can aid in the identification of patients who will progress to cervical cancer. Researchers at Johns Hopkins identified a panel of methylated human papilloma virus (HPV) and human genes that can discriminate between cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 2 or higher (CIN2+) and normal/CIN1 patients in liquid prep samples and in Transrenal DNA (TrDNA) isolated from urine.

    "ip_description": "This invention provides DNA methylation-based biomarkers for predicting Head & Neck Cancer risk. Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide with more than 500,000 new cases and 300,000 deaths each year. Early detection of HNSCC can lead to a satisfactory cure while late detection leads to serious surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, and potential disfigurement, dysfunction, and mortality. Thus, it is important to identify biomarkers and develop diagnostic tests for HNSCC risk. This technology is an epigenetic predictive biomarker for HNSCC. Advantages of this technology include: - Development of early stage diagnostic can reduce costs associated with treating late-stage patients. - High sensitivity (89%) and specificity (63%) for accurate diagnosis - Biomarkers can be adapted into a quick diagnostic test. Johns Hopkins Researchers have identified a genetic biomarker for HNSCC risk. Samples from ten HNSCC patients and ten matched controls were sequenced using methyl binding domain sequencing and subsequently subjected to genome-wide DNA methylation analyses. Subsequent validation tests verified the ability of three methylated gene promoters to discriminate tumor from control samples based on their methylation levels. A gene panel combining any of the three genes had 89% sensitivity, 63% specificity, a 0.91 AUC and a Positive Predictive Value of 91.3%.",

Of the 209 patients diagnosed by endoscopy, pathologists confirmed that 50 cases had an adenocarcinoma and 159 cases were non-tumor controls.

    "ip_description": "Augmented reality (AR) refers to the overlay of computer-generated graphics over a user\u2019s view of the real world. Typically, this is achieved through a device such as a head-mounted display (HMD). HMD-based AR has been used in the medical domain for treatment, education, and surgery. Useful information, measurements and assistive overlays can be provided to the user on a see-through display. For precise tasks on small objects, such as in surgery or dentistry, loupes are commonly used for optical magnification. In previous work, a digital magnification system, in other words, a virtual loupe, was implemented on a video see-through (VST) head-mounted display for surgical applications. The system was evaluated by measuring the completion time of a suturing task performed by surgeons. Although it was accepted by surgeons as a useful functionality, it was limited by the lower quality of digital magnification and by many disadvantages of the VST technology. For example, with VST technology, latency between the real world and the processed images can cause motion sickness, making it inappropriate for critical tasks such as surgery. Improvements are sought to incorporate high quality optical magnification, via loupes, with AR overlays displayed on optical see-through (OST) HMDs, which avoid the above disadvantages of VST technology. Hopkins inventors propose a novel system that combines a head-mounted display and magnifying loupe, with calibration methods to properly provide augmented reality on such devices to allow users to see computer graphics overlaid on the magnified field-of-vision. The major components of the system hardware involve an optical see-through head-mounted display and a head-mounted magnifying. Methods were developed to accurately align the computer graphics with the objects seen by the user, both for the magnified field of vision and non-magnified field of vision. This novel technology also considers the distortion property of the magnifying loupe and accordingly adjusts the visual overlay. The system can provide an accurate overlay over a magnified field of vision for users, e.g. dentists and surgeons. This novel OST-HMD system and its software can potentially achieve better accuracy and efficiency required in clinical or other detailed AR procedures.",

Catheter ablation of VTs can potentially be curative, but recurrence rates remain unacceptably high. Major technological advancements in VT ablation are often highly invasive, time-consuming, and do not necessarily provide optimal ablation targets. Thus, there is a need for novel, non-invasive approaches to improve VT ablation precision. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed a personalized image-based computational heart modeling (digital hearts) approach for VT ablation that incorporates the intramyocardial fat distribution, a newly-recognized arrhythmogenic substrate for VT. This non-invasive, computationally-driven technology reconstructs digital hearts with the patient-specific fat distribution from pre-procedural computed tomographic (CT) images. Using these digital hearts, simulations are executed to predict VTs sustained in the digital-heart fat-based substrate. From these predicted VTs, optimal ablation targets that terminate the VTs in the digital heart are determined, and these targets can be readily exported to electroanatomic mapping navigation systems to guide VT ablation procedures. Because high quality CT\u2019s can be routinely acquired for VT ablation patients, this technology can be readily integrated into contemporary clinical workflows. Currently, the design has been validated against retrospective patient data; however, the invention requires additional development before it can see clinical use.",

Retinoic acid, the active metabolite of retinoids, has been shown to help repair sun damaged skin and reduce fine lines and wrinkles. While retinoic acid benefits users by providing rejuvenated skin, this effect can take months to be visible and can be short-lived, particularly in certain formulations. Consequently, there is a need for novel approaches to improve the efficacy of retinoic acid in anti-aging applications. The inventors identified a novel mechanism of increasing retinoic acid accumulation in human keratinocytes and human skin explants, to improve regeneration. They determined that retinoic acid works synergistically with double stranded RNA (dsRNA) to promote skin rejuvenation. This works particularly well only in the sequential order of retinoic acid first and then dsRNA (and not vice versa).

Of the 300,000 ART cycles performed in the United States in 2017, only 35% of them resulted in a live birth. ART cycles are predominantly unsuccessful due to implantation of low quality embryos with chromosomal abnormalities. Currently, embryonic health is largely determined by subjective morphological and visual analysis that does not provide information on if the embryo will successfully implant and gestate. ART procedures incur high costs ($10,000-20,000 per cycle), insurance policy issues, and immense emotional burden for the individual, family, and reproductive endocrinologists/fertility experts. There is a strong need for objective analysis of the quality of human eggs prior to choosing an oocyte for ART procedures. The Johns Hopkins researchers have developed an objective method for determining the quality of human oocytes, thereby boosting the success rate of ART procedures, by determining microRNA changes in cells surrounding the oocyte. They examined which microRNAs were differentially expressed in aging and young women and identified significant changes in 20 microRNAs in women less than 35 and above 40 years of age. High-throughput PCR was used to validate the changes in microRNA expression. This novel finding can be used to create a diagnostic kit to identify high-quality oocytes for IVF. These microRNAs may also be added to culture media to potentially improve the quality of human oocytes. This will, in turn, improve the success rates of the ART procedures worldwide and provide an objective way to determine which egg has the best success rate of developing into an embryo and ultimately lead to a healthy baby.

As of September 2020, there are over 33 million cases of COVID-19 globally, resulting in 1 million deaths from the virus. Due to diverse individual responses to the virus and limited testing, it has been particularly hard to identify individuals that present no or mild symptoms but can still transmit the infection. To achieve this, it is required to have access to accurate, rapid testing deployed at scales of hundreds of thousands of tests to effectively monitor infection spread and establish mitigation strategies. Thus, there is a need for antibody tests that can be manufactured at scale and deployed at the point of need, for example, at homes, to achieve comprehensive monitoring of immunity, better understand and limit disease spread. The inventors have a proposed solution to quantitatively measure patient antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at the point of need without the use of power sources or expensive instrumentation. The method involves adapting commercial glucose sensors to population-scale measurement of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This method combines a sandwich immunoassay with electrochemical detection through the use of a glucometer. The method also implements biocompatible composite hydrogels in order to prevent the non-specific binding of proteins. The testing approach will include a test strip coated with the hydrogels, which will contain a SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The user will insert the test into a tube containing the patient specimen. If the sample contains anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, they will bind and form complexes on the gel. Following three reagent steps, glucose will be produced on the strip. The amount of glucose produced will be directly proportional to the concentration of antibody-antigen complexes produced by the patient specimen. The tester, by measuring this glucose readout, will obtain a quantitative measure of the extent of immunological response in the specimen. The technology is currently in the ideation phase.",

    "ip_description": "For successful anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, accurate placement of the femoral tunnel is crucial for successful surgery. The torn ligament has to be removed so that the surgeon can see the original ligament attachment sites on the bone, known as the footprints. At these footprints, tunnels are then drilled into the femur and tibia to make anchor points for the graft. The placement of the tunnels is critical for ACL reconstruction; however, the femoral tunnel is particularly difficult to place accurately. Out of approximately 400,000 ACL reconstructions in the United States each year, approximately 60,000 ACL reconstruction surgeries fail due to incorrect placement of the femoral tunnel which results in an additional 43,200 procedures to revise failed ACL reconstructions. With current techniques and tools for ACL tunnel placements, it is difficult for surgeons to reproducibly create anatomical femoral tunnel placements. Thus, there is need for a drill guide which allows for more accurate femoral tunnel placement. Johns Hopkins researchers have designed a technology to allow for accurate and repeatable femoral tunnel drilling which improves visualization of the surgical site and optimizes guide pin drilling. The technology is a drill guide with 5 members: a center rail, a side rail, an anteromedial slider, a femoral slider, and an adjustable center pin which allows for alignment of the drill to the drilling site. Two sliders allow for adjustable movement over arced rails. One of the sliders allows for a femoral tap to pass through. The other slider allows for a drill to pass through. The body of the drill guide comprises a hole for the passing of an arthroscope to view the inside of the joint. The arced rails cover a portion of a 3D sphere and have equal radii to allow for isocentricity. Prototypes have been developed. Currently researchers are working on developing the final form of the device for usability testing and biocompatibility testing.",

Because of these changes, many genetically modified crops have been heralded as having great potential in developing countries. Even in the United States today, approximately 92% of cotton, corn, and soybean crops are genetically modified for various purposes. However, the current state of the art depends upon laboratory-bound techniques, which preclude the testing of plant samples directly at the site of acquisition. Specifically, today\u2019s technology for plant DNA extraction, purification and analysis requires the use of conventional laboratory equipment including centrifuges, heat blocks and thermal cyclers. This technology is expensive and non-mobile, which leads to a plethora of logistical challenges for plant screening in remote locations around the globe. As plant genetic screening is increasingly important for developing countries and remote locations, there is a need for a method to enable genetic analysis of plant material at remote testing sites. The inventors have created a laboratory free method for genetic testing of plant DNA. The inventors believe that the two major technical bottlenecks in the implementation of genetic testing include: 1. laboratory-dependent sample processing steps for nucleic acid purification and 2. the need for trained personnel to operate instruments for complex biological assays. Thus, in order to overcome these issues, the inventors have implemented: 1. a simplified, temperature-compatible protocol for plant cell lysis, consisting of lysis reagents and a filter to separate large particles from the nucleic acid-containing solution; and 2. an automated nucleic acid purification and detection apparatus on a portable device by using integrated microfluidic approaches, such as droplet magnetofluidic assay platforms. These implementations together facilitate an automated, portable method of nucleic acid purification and analysis from an unpurified liquid sample. The technique has been tested for biomarker quantification and allelic discrimination. Further tests are being conducted.",

Application of the high-throughput method allows for deconvolution of polyclonal anti-HCV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in plasma and has identified broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) signatures that contribute to clearance of the virus.

    "ip_description": "Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infectious diseases in the world, affecting 50-60% of women at least once in their lifetime. In the United States, UTIs account for over 2 million emergency department visits and approximately $3.5 billion in healthcare costs annually. Unfortunately, UTI resistance to first line antibiotics is also growing. In order to promote antibiotic stewardship and reduce healthcare costs associated with UTIs, healthcare providers need definitive and clinically actionable diagnoses for UTIs, including both pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). Current bacterial pathogen ID/AST technologies rely on traditional culture-based methods and thus require several days to complete. Consequently, UTIs are often empirically treated at outpatient clinics with first-line, broad-spectrum oral antibiotics. There is an urgent need to expedite bacterial pathogen ID/AST. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a new approach for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases based on microfluidic droplet-based single-cell measurements of bacterial 16S rRNA. This approach provides the foundation to achieve both pathogen ID and AST from clinical samples at significantly shortened timescales, within as little as thirty-minutes. The researchers have shown proof of principle for their accelerated bacterial pathogen ID/AST technology. The technology is capable of classifying up to nine unique uropathogenic species into appropriate phylogenetic categories with a sensitivity and specificity that is comparable to what is standard within the field. In addition to bacterial classification, this strategy is capable of assessing the antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens with antibiotic exposure durations as low as ten-minutes for three commonly administered antibiotics with distinct mechanisms (i.e., gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and ampicillin), making it one of the fastest combined ID/AST platform to date.",

    "ip_description": "The Mayo Clinic estimates that over 200,000 traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) occur in the United States every year, usually as consequences of car accidents and contact sports. TBIs are associated with a variety of health complications including indirect trauma to the optic nerve. Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy is a poorly understood condition in which the optic nerve is damaged somehow after an impact to the head; it can result in partial or total loss of vision. It is much less common than direct traumatic optic neuropathy, which is estimated occur in up to 5% of closed head trauma and occurs when the bones surrounding the optic nerve break and cut or crush the optic nerve. Vision loss associated with indirect traumatic optic neuropathy can be a devastating and frustrating condition as there is no treatment and the outcomes are quite variable. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the anatomical biomechanics underlying indirect optic nerve damage to provide the appropriate prevention guidelines and therapeutic interventions. Given the difficulty of direct experimentation with head trauma, there is a pressing need for accurate computational models that understand neurodegenerative events caused by TBI and blunt head trauma. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel computational head model which simulates optic nerve injury resulting from blunt impact. The Computational Head Model with Orbit (CHMO) inputs images from state-of-the-art imaging techniques to model the anatomy and physiology of a human head to simulate optic nerve injury under blunt impact. The CHMO technology can predict deformation of the optic nerve under controlled conditions of input energy and locations of impact (frontal, lateral, and posterior parts of the head). This invention is further capable of elucidating biomechanics of blunt head injury and optic nerve strain in a variety of head trauma related events.",

    "ip_description": "With lung diseases, namely influenza and lung cancer, on the rise, pulmonary vaccination is a promising approach to elicit strong immunity to inhaled pathogens and lung cancer compared to systemic immunization strategies. In particular, inhaled DNA vaccination, a rapidly developing field, can potentially promote humoral and cellular immunity in prophylactic and therapeutic applications. DNA vaccines also have advantageous features compared to their traditional counterparts, including more efficient scale-up and superior stability, which facilitates faster global distribution. However, the mucus gel layer lining the lung airway hampers the efficient delivery of DNA to pulmonary dendritic cells, limiting the effectiveness of this approach. So far no DNA vaccination platform that has been tested clinically penetrates the mucus layer efficiently. Consequently novel inhaled DNA vaccination platforms that can better elicit immunity in the lungs is a promising approach to improve the prevention and treatment of pulmonary diseases. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed mucus-penetrating particles (MPP) that can facilitate more efficient penetration of gene vectors across the human airway mucus and elicit durable immunity. This delivery platform utilizes vectors that have shown widespread airway distribution, deep epithelium penetration, prolonged lung retention, robust transgene expression, and increased uptake by dendritic cells in the airway epithelium of mouse models. Importantly, MPP-mediated pulmonary DNA vaccination induced memory T-cell responses that indicative of long term immunity. When tested in vivo, MPP treatment enhance survival in an orthotopic mouse model of aggressive lung cancer. The inventors have demonstrated the proof-of-concept in vivo with a model target antigen. They are currently evaluating the platform with therapeutic antigens.",

The device consists of a headband with bone transducers that stimulates OAEs in subjects and connects to a smartphone with the OtoScreen app. Unlike current devices that stimulate OAEs through air conduction (where a tone is sent through the ear canal to stimulate OAE in the inner ear), bone conduction separates the input stimulus and the OAE signal coming from the ear. This simplifies data analysis and eliminates undesirable signal noise. In the app, data collected by the headband is analyzed for signs of hearing loss. The app then displays a \u201cpass\u201d or \u201creferral\u201d result. In the case of a \u201creferral\u201d result, the app forwards the data to a specialist for further analysis. OtoScreen completely automates the screening exam. It only requires a healthcare provider to place the headband on the patient and start the exam by pressing a button, making it easy to obtain hearing screening without trained personnel. Unlike existing devices that require soundproof studios to operate, Otoscreen accurately detects otoacoustic emissions produced by the ear even when in noisy environments. The device is cost-effective and consists of easily obtainable off-the-shelf components such as single-board computers, bone transducers, and microphones. Because Otoscreen relies on accessible smartphone-compatible technology instead of expensive equipment, it enables wider screening accessibility in the developing world.",

    "ip_description": "The current designs of weightbearing orthopaedic implants are limited due to the variabilities in the material and structural properties of the bones in which they are implanted. In addition, many orthopaedic conditions -- and the implantation of foreign materials into the body -- are associated with significant risk of complications including infection, pain, and impaired healing, among others. For many of these complications and conditions, multiple-staged operative procedures are necessary for adequate treatment. For others, systemic administration of therapeutic agents (such as antibiotics or pain killers) may be indicated as part of the post-operative management plan. Some of these systemic agents are limited by off-target effects and systemic toxicity. As a result, treatment of many challenging surgical cases including arthroplasty, arthroplasty revision, spinal fusion, and traumatic injury are associated with significant patient morbidity and high financial cost. Currently no commercial solution exists to appropriately address these challenges within orthopaedic surgical care. Using advances in structural engineering and manufacturing methodology, researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed novel design strategies to more optimally tailor implants to suit the mechanical properties of each individual patient. In addition, the improved design parameters enable this technology to have controlled release of therapeutic agents through passive and/or active methods acting directly at the surgical site. This enables local administration of medical substances, targeted precisely to the site of need, and therefore minimizing the off-target effects and systemic toxicity. Perhaps more importantly, the combination of this custom or semi-custom hardware and localized therapeutic administration provides the improved opportunity to definitively treat some complex clinical conditions with a single surgical procedure rather than a multiple-staged approach. Furthermore, for patients that have already received such an implant in the past and develop a late complication, it provides the possibility to treat many challenging orthopaedic conditions non-operatively. This approach represents a profound paradigm shift in the management of many difficult clinical scenarios, and an opportunity to reduce both morbidity and financial burden. This technology serves as a powerful solution that may be applied to both routine surgical procedures, as well as address many of the most complex orthopaedic conditions.",

    "ip_description": "In the United States, approximately 14.6 million Americans are estimated to suffer from diabetic retinopathy by the year 2050 (see CDC). Diabetic retinopathy is a debilitating condition defined by the loss of vision due to leaky blood vessels of the retina. The current standard of care includes prevention measures, pharmacological therapies, and surgery as a last resort. However, this strategy is limited by only providing vision management rather than fully-restored vision. To improve the current standards, recent research has focused on deploying vascular regenerative cell-therapies with conventional human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). While promising, the current approaches to generate hiPSCs are limited by high inter-line variability of differentiation and poor efficiency for generating functionally transplantable vascular progenitors. There is a dire need for a new approach that eliminates variability of differentiation and efficiently establishes functional transplantable vascular progenitors. Johns Hopkins researchers developed a novel approach to generate na\u00efve vascular progenitors with enhanced in vivo proliferation and engraftment capacities. The inventors demonstrated that a novel class of tankyrase inhibitor-regulated na\u00efve hiPSC (N-hiPSC) with improved functionality can significantly improve vascular cell-therapies by more efficiently reprogramming the epigenetic state of a patient\u2019s donor cells. The na\u00efve vascular progenitors derived from N-hiPSC have a novel embryonic phenotype and possess both improved pericytic and endothelial regenerative potential. Vascular progenitors generated from these novel N-hiPSCs strongly express vascular cell identity markers, maintain greater genomic stability, and have decreased non-lineage gene expression, while exhibiting improved migration and vascularization properties in the ischemic retina. The application of these embryonic pericytic na\u00efve vascular progenitors has potentially high impact in vascular regenerative medicine for treating ischemic retinopathy, myocardial infarction, and cerebral vascular stroke. More broadly, this approach provides a new class of human stem cells for regenerative medicine that may extend beyond diabetic retinopathies to address other disease states.",

While many aerosol therapeutics are used to treat lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cystic fibrosis, administration of drugs selectively to the lungs remains challenging. The nature of the lung anatomy and limitations to aerosol-based drug administration can cause premature degradation of the compounds and reduced delivery to target sites such as peripheral airways, leading to decreased therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, these drug administrations can lead to complications. Thus, there is a need for a method that increases the efficacy and safety of inhalation-based lung disease treatments. Johns Hopkins researchers have created a technology that consists of therapeutic self-assembling molecules that are able to form supramolecular structures of various shape and sizes in aqueous solutions. These formulations function to increase retention time in the lungs, improve therapeutic efficacy, and improve the quality of life of recipients. Additionally, these self-assembling molecules can be either loaded with therapeutics within their hydrophobic core during encapsulation or can be directly conjugated to an effector in the case of hydrophobic drugs or imaging reagents. The supramolecular formulations developed are superior replacements for current-free drug inhalation-based formulations to treat long disease as they remain stabilized within aerosol droplets and travel via inhalation into the regions of the lungs where they can deposit onto lung tissue. In vitro testing of the formulations has been completed and in vivo assessment of the platform against relevant lung diseases is ongoing.",

While both circular clock displays and linear schedules can be used individually, maximum efficiency may be achieved when both displays are used in conjunction with one another as they are singularly unable to visualize real-time data for multiple simultaneous tasks. In order to enhance the efficiency of concurrent and asynchronous tasks, we report a time/task management display incorporating elements of both circular and linear visualization methods. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Hospital have developed a novel task scheduling tool for enhanced real-time task monitoring and data visualization. This novel display incorporates a series of concentric circles to enhance situational awareness of multiple simultaneous activities. Each concentric circle corresponds to either user selectable or automatically assigned tasks to provide deconfliction as the \u201ccurrent time\u201d indicator sweeps around the circular display. Various sectors within each concentric circle are colored to correspond to the beginning and end of an event or activity.

    "ip_description": "Millimeter-wave cryogenic receivers require rejection of infrared (IR) radiation to reduce thermal loads on the cold stages of the cryostat. As telescope apertures increase in diameter to accommodate larger focal planes, the requirements for infrared \ufb01ltering become more stringent, while the fabrication of \ufb01lters becomes correspondingly more difficult. This is a particular problem for current cosmic microwave background receivers, which have receiver apertures approaching 1 m in diameter. Absorptive \ufb01lters have also been extensively used, in which a material with low loss at millimeter wavelengths but strong absorption in the IR absorbs power and conducts it to higher-temperature stages of a receiver. However, absorbing \ufb01lters require anti-re\ufb02ection coatings and lose e\ufb00ectiveness as their diameter increases, because the centers of the \ufb01lters tend to heat and re-radiate further down the optical chain. The inventors have developed highly transparent, broadband, and tunable IR-blocking optical filters composed of small scattering particles embedded in an aerogel substrate that diffusely scatter infrared radiation. The aerogel is ultra-low-density (50-200mg/cc) with a low index of refraction, removing the need for anti-reflection coatings and allowing for ultra-broadband operation across frequencies ranging from zero to 10 THz. The size of the particles can be tuned to give variable cutoff frequencies. Test filters have been produced and tested.",

    "ip_description": "The current invention is an intraoprative surgical imaging and modeling method to assist in periacetabular osteotomy (hip dysplasia) surgeries. Hip dysplasia is a medical condition that is characterized by a misalignment of the hip joint. The cause can be driven by congenital or developmental factors, both of which lead to significant arthritis in this joint. While hip replacement surgery can be used to address this issue, this procedure is not appropriate for all patients. This is largely due to the implanted devices have a limited lifetime. Currently, this procedure requires that the hip bone to be cut, reoriented, and fixed with screws to allow for better interaction with the femur at the hip joint. The new technology aids in this procedure and has the following advantages: \u00b7 Applies imaging data to computerized anatomical models to display the position of the acetabular fragment, prior to it being fixed with screws. \u00b7 A reference frame can be built from applying the computer model, providing surgeons with accurate positioning information so that they have confidence in the new orientation of the bone \u00b7 Does not require extra fiducial markers. Technical Details: Johns Hopkins researcher have developed a method to interaoperatively comfirm hip fragment position in 3D and improve the accuracy of this procedure. For younger patients periacetabular osteotomy is an alternative procedure that repositions a section of hip bone to correct misalignments. This invention imparts trackable features on the bone which may then be monitored intraoperatively.",

    "ip_description": "Stem cells are harnessed to create a stent-based \u201cparacrine factor factory\u201d using a novel biodegradable nanofiber sleeve which protects the cells from washout and immune attack, and provides a sheltered in vivo on-stent milieu for the cells to continuously produce and deliver healing growth factors and exosomes to injured tissue. Current methods to administer stem cells to the heart, including intracoronary infusion or direct intramyocardial injection, do not allow for prolonged retention of the cells, and therefore do not lead to a sustained growth factor release. Rapid cell washout, diffusion, immune attack, and an inhospitable environment are some factors that limit cardiac retention of viable stem cells and, consequently, the opportunity for the stem cells to produce sufficient growth factors to result in robust clinical effects. The novel cell-impregnated nanofiber sleeve technology employs a biodegradable nanofiber fabric to cage stem cells onto stents and other medical devices. The nanofiber sleeve acts as a substrate on which the stem cells grow, and as a protective semi-permeable barrier that prevents washout of the stem cells into the bloodstream, excludes host immune cells, and at the same time, allows free passage of growth factors, exosomes, nutrients and wastes as well as the host's signaling cytokines. With the stem cells protected, the nanofiber sleeve behaves as an intravascular factory that produces and releases therapeutic growth factors and exosomes directly into the circulation and to the injured tissue. Advantages of the technology includes: \u2022   Cell-based intravascular production of pro-healing growth factors and exosomes in vivo, directly on-stent and in damaged tissue \u2022   Isolation of cells from the immune system, allowing the use of \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d allogeneic cells from healthy donors. \u2022   Protection of cells from wash-out, allowing prolonged production of therapeutic factors. \u2022   Nanofiber sleeves can be tailored to biodegrade over different time scales required for healing. \u2022   Can be used to cover other medical devices such as pacemakers, ICDs, and leads, or applied directly in the tissue. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a method by which stem cell delivery to the heart can be achieved successfully through a novel stents sleeve. Using this method, the nanofiber stent sleeve can be wrapped around a stent to provide a platform by which abundant numbers of stem cells can be placed directly at a site proximal to the injured tissue, shielded from washout and immune attack, so that ample and continuous localized production of pro-healing growth factors directly to the damaged tissue can take place.",

    "ip_description": "The application of imaging through different modalities has opened several pathways for analysis and study of different materials. Specifically, many applications of cathodes, such as LaB6 have been used for small spot applications, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy and Tunneling Electron Microscopy for surface analysis and metrology applications. They have also been implemented in microwave tubes, lithography, electron-beam welders, X-ray sources, and free electron lasers as these cathodes allow for electron emission. However, although fine-tuned for current applications, there is significant room for improvement in application and analysis. For example, the efficiency of the electron emitter, based on the material of the cathode and characterized by work functions, can be enhanced. Specifically, it is understood that the lower the work function the better the efficiency. Therefore, there is a need for the production of thermionic emitting materials that are capable of generating electron beams to have a lower function to reach the full potential in technological application. In addition, this material must be able to have specific growth conditions that allow for reproducibility along with improved efficiency, cost effectiveness, and accuracy. Studies have shown SrVO3 could be a potential solution to this problem. However, thermionic emission surface studies to date of SrVO3 have been hampered by the lack of good quality, large single crystals. To combat this, the inventors have developed an efficient and reproducible process that can be utilized to produce high quality SrVO3 single crystals that are much larger in size than previously studied. This method for production of this improved thermionic emitting material in an efficient protocol that results in large crystal production of SrVO3 with dimension up to 15-20 nm in length and 0.6 mm in diameter consistently, which improves upon the high level of variability in other production methodologies for SrVO3. Therefore, the inventors have conclusively and reproducibly discovered a process that ensures growth of large single crystals of SrVO3 along with other known compounds without secondary phase impurities. This can be a potential application for next generation thermionic electron emitters in device such as electron beam lithography and electron microscopy can utilize this process, due to the ability to reduce the difficulty in preparing the material with sufficient purity and crystalline quality.",

Various treatment strategies, including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, exist for prostate cancer but their success depends on the stage of the cancer at diagnosis. Novel biological therapies that often result in less side effects can also be used to treat prostate cancer. This involves engineering immune cells to genetically express recombinant receptors that will then target tumor cells. However, after the administration of these engineered cells to patients, a method for detecting, monitoring, and modulating this therapy in vivo is needed to achieve maximal therapeutic impact and efficacy. Johns Hopkins researchers have engineered T-cells expressing wild type PSMA antigen or an N-terminally modified PSMA variant. These T-cells exhibit both cytolytic activity and cytokine release in vitro. After adoptive transfer of these T-cells to mice with both local and metastatic tumors, tumor size was reduced and survival was increased compared to controls. The researchers also developed a method for detecting and identifying these T-cells in vivo using a radiolabeled tracer for demonstrating localization of the PSMA-expressing engineered T-cells at tumor sites in mice. The inventors have developed PSMA-expressing T-cells and a method for identifying and monitoring them in vivo.

Patients with hip dysplasia have a shallow, dish-shaped acetabulum, compared to a normal cup-shape. Untreated hip dysplasia can lead to a breakdown in joint cartilage, arthritis and fractures. PAO surgery is recommended for young patients over joint-replacement due to short hardware lifetime. PAO surgery involves the cutting and realignment of the acetabulum in order to form a deeper socket, requiring the surgeon to assess the new joint angle intraoperatively by X-ray. Currently, PAO surgeries are generally performed without computer assistance, however, utilizing this surgical method could improve the process by: \u00b7      Assessing the bone realignment by a series of biometrics computed automatically by the software to ensure proper realignment prior to fragment fixation. \u00b7      Uses intraoperative x-ray imaging, which PAO surgeons already need to perform and are comfortable doing so. \u00b7      Many other surgical navigation systems require optical trackers, which not all hospitals own, are costly, and can be disrupted by occlusion.

    "ip_description": "Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is rare and severe form of childhood-onset epilepsy associated with various types of seizures and cognitive dysfunction that persist into adulthood; yet, to date, LGS management is challenged by the lack of reliable diagnostic tests and potentially grave side-effects of available therapeutics. Rufinamide is a promising new compound with broad anti-epileptic activity; however, its mode of action remains speculative, thereby hampering the wide-spread use of the drug. Hence, this invention discovered that rufinamide exerts its function primarily via modulating the activity of a particular sodium channel isoform (hNav), and further identified strongly anti-epileptic structural rufinamide analogs, useful for the efficient treatment of LGS, related epileptic disorders, and and diseases such as cognitive impairment without seizures, migraine, autism, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Advantages include: - Unraveling of a hNav isoform as the target of rufinamide enables development of additional effective drugs - Structural derivative compounds of rufinamide for an efficacious therapy of epileptic diseases and seizures - Significantly reduced seizure occurrence and severity in 3 animal models widely applicable for epilepsy disorders. Johns Hopkins researchers have designed structural derivatives of the newly discovered anti-epileptic drug rufinamide that exhibit strongly enhanced inhibition of a voltage-gated sodium channel, thus presenting valuable new therapeutics for epileptic diseases and seizure disorders. Inventors explored the mode of action of rufinamide, a recently identified anti-epileptic drug with a unique hydrophobic triazole-derived molecular structure. Of the nine sodium channel isoforms identified in humans, four are predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. Interestingly, clinically relevant rufinamide concentrations only slightly alter recovery from fast inactivation of these four neuronal isoforms; yet, the drug dramatically inhibits activation of one particular isoform. Importantly, structure-activity relationship studies identified rufinamide derivatives chemically modified at particular positions on the triazole pharmacophore with notably enhanced efficacy. Therefore, this technology provides a panel of biologically active rufinamide derivatives that can be exploited to obtain high efficacy of drug-induced inhibition of activation of a specific sodium channel isoform, valuable as novel therapeutics for LGS and related disorders.",

Opiate-mediated respiratory suppression (ORS) is the primary cause of opiate-associated deaths, and obesity greatly increases opiate-related mortality. Obesity also contributes to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is found in more than 50% of obese individuals. Although we know that opiates exacerbate OSA, the mechanism of the pathogenesis is not fully understood. Although naloxone has shown effective and rapid reversal of respiratory depression induced by opioids, it has to a shorter half-life than most opiates, which may lead to recurrence of respiratory depression. In addition, naloxone reverses the anti-analgesic effects of opiates. Thus, effective nonopioids are urgently needed to add to the repertoire of drugs available for use in the treatment of ORS.\n\n Technology Overview\n Johns Hopkins and George Washington University researchers have discovered a new use of a certain natural compound to prevent morphine-induced OSA in diet induced obesity (DIO) mice through intranasal administration (IN). They have demonstrated the mechanism behind morphine-induced OSA, and have shown that IN administration of the compound partly prevented morphine-induced OSA in a previously published DIO mouse model. Their in vitro studies have also elucidated the mechanism behind the relationship between the compound and opiate-mediated OSA.\n\n Stage of Development\n The researchers have completed in vivo studies of the effect of the compound on opiate-mediated OSA using OSA mouse models.",

However, these treatments often have side effects that affect the quality of life of the Pca patients. Hence, there is an urgent need for developing better target-based therapies. This technology is a novel therapeutic that exploits the cytotoxic effects of a bacterial toxin, aerolysin, engineered to specifically target prostate tumor cells. Other advantages of this technology include: \u2022 Enhanced targeting to tumor site using a naturally occurring and abundant human serum protein \u2022 Decreased immunogenicity for prolonged potency. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a modified protoxin which more efficiently targets prostate cancer tumors using human serum album (HSA) for more potent and targeted tumor cell killing. The therapeutic will be composed of human serum albumin (HSA)-prostrate specific antigen (PSA)-proaerolysin (HSA-PSA-proaerolysin). Specifically, the protoxin will be made by fusing the C-terminus of HSA via a PSA cleavable peptide linker to the N-terminus of PSA proaerolysin to generate a novel recombinant fusion protein. The former developed toxin was toxic to cells due to its capacity to bind to GPI-anchored proteins found on normal cells in the blood or host tissues. The addition of the HSA fragment will inhibit the recombinant toxin from binding to GPI-anchored proteins. Instead, it will accumulate via an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect within sites of metastatic prostate cancer where enzymatically active PSA in the extracellular fluid will hydrolyze the HSA linker liberating PSA-proaerolysin. Additionally, PSA will also remove the C-terminal inhibitory peptide from PSA-proaerolysin to generate aerolysin monomers which can oligomerize to form the heptameric pores that will result in selective primary killing of prostate tumor cells.",

    "ip_description": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) contributes to 90% of all cases of diabetes and represents a critical global public health problem. T2D specifically affects glucose metabolism and those with the disease either do not produce enough insulin or do not respond properly to insulin signaling to maintain normal levels of glucose in the blood. Several serious complications can result from T2D and only maintenance therapy exists. The most effective drug therapy for T2D is glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), but its short half-life in the blood of less than 2 minutes represents a critical challenge for actual clinical application. At present, there have been many attempts to generate analogs of GLP-1 that have better circulation and longer half-lives. One especially promising candidate is exendin-4, which has a 20-30 time longer blood half-life, shares 53% sequence homology to GLP-1, and demonstrates many necessary glucoregulatory functions. However one potential caveat to the use of exendin-4 is that it has poor serum stability, requiring injection twice daily. Consequently, there is a critical unmet need to enhance the durability and effectiveness of exendin-4 treatment as well as its serum stability and circulation time for improved treatment of T2D that results in fewer injections and better overall patient compliance. Johns Hopkins researchers developed a tannic acid (TA)/exendin-4/Fe3+ ternary nanoparticle system that complexes TA and exendin-4 stabilized via a TA-Fe3+ coordination. These nanoparticles were highly uniform and had a high encapsulation efficiency of exendin-4. The system enables the nanoparticles to release their encapsulated peptides in a pH-dependent and controlled manner. Upon IP injection of the exendin-4 nanoparticles into a T2D mouse model, they achieved a rapid reduction in blood glucose levels in less than 12 hours. They were able to maintain normal levels for 72 hours and levels were maintained below the therapeutic threshold for 6 days with only one injection. The exendin-4 nanoparticles also had better blood circulation time and half-life compared to protein alone. This TA/exendin-4/Fe3+ ternary nanoparticle system represents a potential novel treatment method for T2D but could be scalable to other peptides and disease systems. The inventors have developed a method for the scalable production of a nanoparticle system that can be used to encapsulate bioactive proteins with high efficiency and a controllable release rate. This system of peptide-loaded nanoparticles has the potential to treat a variety of diseases. Thus far, it has been tested for T2D in mice but further research and optimization is required to expand the system to other diseases and ultimately human patients.",

For this reason, the development of orphan drugs for those diseases that affect a small subset of the population. One of such diseases, Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy (DMD) affects 1 in 5000 boys worldwide and has no known cure. Current drug screen platforms include animal models and myoblasts from patient biopsies which each have their challenges, including failure to translate to human treatments and limited phenotypical diversity, respectively. Thus, there is a need for a high throughput and efficient drug screening platform to search for cures. A drug screening system involving DMD human induced pluripotent stem cells (DMD-hiPSCs) and high content imaging has been developed. One in-vitro proxy for DMD is deficiency in myoblast differentiation and fusion. Using this characteristic, DMD-hiPSCs are differentiated in an extracellular matrix and purified for myoblasts using a unique cell surface marker. Once myoblasts are plated, various compounds can be tested in-vitro for their effect on differentiation and fusion by high content imaging. This platform was tested using 1,524 small molecule compounds from the Johns Hopkins Clinical Compound Library, where 9 compounds produced significant increases in in-vitro fusion rates. Two compounds were selected for an in-vivo mouse DMD model study, where both significantly ameliorated DMD skeletal muscle disease phenotypes. This platform demonstrates the feasibility of early-stage drug development for rare and neglected diseases using symptom-relevant cells derived from patient-specific hiPSCs.

    "ip_description": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which typically impacts the lungs. In 2016, there were 10.4 million new cases of TB and 1.7 million deaths worldwide, with approximately one-fourth of the world\u2019s population infected. As a result, TB is one of the leading infectious disease killers and a serious public health problem. The typical treatment course for drug-sensitive TB has a duration of at least 6 months and incurs a direct cost of over $18,000 USD. However, the incidence of drug-resistant TB is greatly increasing, including multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug resistant (XDR), and totally drug resistant (TDR) TB, presenting a major challenge to treating TB and controlling its transmission. Consequently, there is a critical need for the development of novel therapeutics and strategies for treating both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. Johns Hopkins researchers have identified coumestan analogues as novel compounds for treating TB that inhibit mycolic acid synthesis needed for generating the Mtb cell wall. These natural analogues demonstrated potent anti-TB activity in vitro, with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for 90% inhibition. Good oral bioavailability of these compounds was observed in mice using a serum titration assay, and they were noncytotoxic to mammalian cells in vitro at concentrations far exceeding their MIC90 measured for Mtb. Whole genome sequencing of Mtb strains resistant to the coumestans revealed a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the polyketide synthase 13 gene (pks13), verifying Pks13 as the target for these analogues and druggability of Pks13 for the development of other antitubercular agents. The inventors have identified novel, potential therapeutic compounds and their target for the treatment of TB. Further studies are required to determine efficacy against Mtb in vivo, toxicity in vivo, and their success in combination with other antitubercular drugs already in use.",

They involve the removal, culture, and expansion of resident T cells ex-vivo several thousand fold before reinfusion back into the body. However, a concern with current culturing methods is their inconsistency in developing and retaining the required cellular phenotypes and the slow speed at which proliferation can be achieved. Improved modulation of the cell culture environment is an opportunity to increase efficiency and efficacy of adoptive cell transfer immunotherapies. A hyaluronic acid (HA) based hydrogel presenting two immune-stimulatory signals for T cell activation has been developed. The hydrogel functions as an extracellular stimulating matrix, comparable to the role of lymph nodes. The structure has tunable stiffness properties allowing for biomimetic mechanotransduction required for effective T cell stimulation. Finally, the presence of physical ligands attached to the matrix provides more efficient stimulation that current culture techniques relying on soluble signals. The technology was validated in an in-vitro model where proliferation was markedly better than soluble signal and then in a rare antigen specific in-vivo model where higher survival and lower tumor growth was observed. The inventors have developed an immune-stimulatory hydrogel capable of functioning as an extracellular matrix to stimulate T cells to a greater extent than soluble signals.

Human breast cancer cell lines with mutant and wild-type GATA3, including MCF-7 and CAMA1, respectively, are commercially available. MCF-7 harbors a GATA3 frame shift mutation (D336Gfs*17) commonly observed in breast cancer, but in order to determine the precise role of this mutation, an isogenic cell line with wild-type GATA3 is required. Alternatively, a cell line isogenic to CAMA1, but with mutant GATA3 would also be an appropriate mutant/control pairing that could be used to probe the function of this specific GATA3 mutation in breast cancer. Johns Hopkins researchers used recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors to generate two different cell lines useful for human breast cancer research related to GATA3 mutation. The first is derived from MCF-7 cells in which mutant GATA3 was replaced with the wild-type gene for all alleles. The second is derived from CAMA-1 cells in which the GATA3 D336Gfs*17 mutation was introduced into one allele. Both of these cell lines have been validated, and initial experiments have been performed to characterize the functional effects of GATA3 manipulation in vitro and in vivo as well as in preclinical drug studies, demonstrating the utility of these cell lines as basic research and translational tools.",

These technologies will provide very fast eye trackers as well as gaze conjugacy detectors/analyzers. Some embodiments may be very cost-efficient, small and portable.

VAc is poorly compatible with early transition metal olefin polymerization catalysts. VAc-derived radicals have the propensity to undergo chain transfer and termination events, presenting a challenge for controlled polymerization techniques such as atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). VAc also exhibits poor copolymerization behavior with conjugated monomers like styrene (St), methyl acrylate (MA), and methyl methacrylate (MMA). Johns Hopkins inventors report BN 2-vinylnaphthalene (BN2VN), a PVA precursor with versatile reactivity arising from its aromatic structure, for the free radical copolymerization with both MMA and tert-butyl methacrylate (tBMA). This work significantly expands the scope of functionally rich boron-functionalized polymers suitable for oxidative functionalization. This allowed the material to yield copolymers bearing ester and lactone subunits, as well as alcohol functional groups. The functionally rich and polar polymers prepared herein are likely to have several potential applications. As both PMMA and PVA are biocompatible polymers, conjugates could be prepared by covalent attachment of a desired small molecule. The lactone substructures may impart unique mechanical properties to the polymers by reducing degrees of freedom along the backbone. Inventors demonstrate BN2VN-MMA copolymerization and structurally characterized the resulting copolymer using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. They further demonstrated postpolymerization functionalization of BN2VN-MMA copolymers by oxidation to yield copolymers bearing ester and lactone subunits.",

This condition occurs when there is insufficient coverage of the femoral head by an excessively shallow acetabulum (hip socket). Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) is a common surgical procedure to treat DDH by reorienting the hip joint for increased femoral head coverage. Current surgical methodology requires a clinician to measure coverage of the femoral head intraoperatively via the use of a 2D fluoroscopic image. Accurate and consistent mental interpretation of fluoroscopy to determine the position and orientation of acetabular bone fragments in 3D space is difficult and time consuming. Consequently, the adoption of more automated techniques to measure femoral head coverage could improve the efficiency of PAO surgeries. The inventors have developed a fast, automated method to compute the pose of PAO fragments to enhance intraoperative x-ray navigation. In this approach, two constellations of metallic ball-bearings (BB) are injected to map the patient\u2019s acetabular fragment and pelvis fragment. The 3D locations of each BB are reconstructed using fluoroscopic views and 2D/3D registrations to a preoperative CT scan of the pelvis. This approach can estimate the relative pose of the acetabular fragment to the pelvis fragment by estimating the movement of the two BB constellations using a single fluoroscopic view taken after osteotomy and fragment relocation. BB detection and inter-view correspondences are automatically computed throughout the processing pipeline. Importantly, when tested in cadaver surgeries, this method demonstrated similar accuracy to other state of the art systems.

Consequently, novel methods of detecting Tn antigen in cancer specimens would improve our understanding of cancer pathogenesis and have important clinical applications.

    "ip_description": "The most sensitive part of the human retina, the fovea, changes the polarization state of light when scanned with a low-power polarized beam of light. This produces a particular pattern which can be used for eye tracking or monitoring central fixation. The latter is useful in diagnosing strabismus (cross-sightedness) and amblyopia (\u201clazy eye\u201d), as is done by several existing vision screening devices. Unfortunately, some optical components of these instruments interfere with the polarization measurements by introducing unwanted retardance which alters the polarization state of the light entering the eye and of the light reaching the detection system after reflection from the ocular fundus. Similarly, the cornea also affects polarization, further reducing precision and reliability. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a suite of tools to perform retinal birefringence scans while automatically compensating for unwanted retardance within the instrument and in the cornea. The invention relates to compensating for polarization changes introduced by components with retardation in polarization-sensitive retinal scanning systems. Compensating retarders are provided to nullify the effect of unwanted retardance in the forward and return light paths, so that the polarization states of the light entering the eye and the light reaching the detection system are not contaminated by the effects of the unwanted retardance. Mueller matrices are also used to mathematically calculate the parameters for the compensating retarders. A variable retarder system has also been described, to compensate for the corneal birefringence of the patient\u2019s eye via feedback control.

    "ip_description": "Approximately 4 million polypectomies are performed each year in the United States alone. Delayed bleeding is the most common post-operative complication of polypectomies, impacting between 0.3% and 6.1% of all patients. Some polypectomy techniques, such as hot snare (electrocautery), reduce immediate bleeding by coagulating tissue at the surgical site; however, delayed bleeding may occur once the coagulated tissue is eventually sloughed off. In contrast, cold snare polypectomy has a significantly reduced rate of delayed bleeding, at only 0.1%. Consequently, cold snare polypectomy has gained widespread clinical adoption and is the primary technique for resecting polyps of up to 10mm. However, further optimization of the cold-snare technique is required to minimize the number of delayed bleeding incidents. Hence, there is a need for an improved cold snare design to minimize bleeding during polypectomy procedures. The device is a traditional polypectomy wire snare with a modified cutting profile. The novel surface of the snare enhances its cutting ability, ensuring cleaner surgical margins and making the cold-snare procedure easier for gastroenterologists to perform. Additionally, the unique cutting surface promotes hemostasis by encouraging the tissue adjacent the surgical cuts to re-seal, further reducing the likelihood of bleeding. Also, unlike with existing hot forceps and hot snare techniques that thermally coagulate and destroy the tissue sample, the tissue samples retrieved by cold snare remain intact, allowing for histopathological analysis.",

    "ip_description": "Therapeutic cancer vaccines aim to activate the antitumor T cell response. These vaccines are designed to prime na\u00efve antitumor T cells, by activating antigen presenting cells, particularly dendritic cells (DCs). DNA-based cancer vaccines are a particularly promising approach, partially due to the ease with which they can be manufactured. However, DNA-based cancer vaccines to date have been largely ineffective in the clinic. This is attributed to the poor immunogenicity of DNA-based vaccines on their own. Consequently, there is a need to develop effective formulations and adjuvants that amplify the antitumor responses elicited by DNA-based cancer vaccines. The inventors have developed a novel approach to properly prime the immune response in a patient to tumor antigen. This approach combines a DNA-based vaccine, consisting of CCL20 (MIP-3\u03b1) fused to the tumor antigen, with the administration of type I interferon (IFN) and 5-aza-2\u2019-deoxycitidine (AZA), and CpG. MIP-3\u03b1 binds to CCR6, a chemokine receptor found on immature dendritic cells, thereby targeting the tumor antigen to dendritic cells. This approach reduces the tumor burden in melanoma mouse models. The addition of IFN, AZA, and CpG significantly enhanced the immunogenicity of this tumor vaccine, increasing the median survival of vaccine alone by 39% and no vaccine by 86%. Importantly, this system is able to change targeted antigens easily, allowing the use of different or multiple tumor antigens to personalize treatment options. This was found to increase the immune response and median survival in mouse models of melanoma.",

    "published_date": "2/7/2020",
    "ip_description": "Cortical stimulation mapping is an electrocorticography monitoring that involves a surgically invasive clinical procedure. Its purpose serves to localize functions of specific cerebral regions of the brain through electrical stimulation of a cerebral cortex. During cortical stimulation mapping, electrodes are placed directly on to the cerebral cortex of a subject and electrical stimulations may be applied to monitor for electrical responses or after-discharges. The after-discharge can reveal abnormal or unstable cerebral regions, known as epileptogenic zones, which are prone to spontaneous seizures. Although clinicians prefer to thoroughly test additional regions, in vivo cortical stimulation mapping procedures can lead to additional invasive surgical procedures which can be potentially harmful to the subject. There is a need in the field for a non-invasive accurate localization platform to accurately map epileptogenic zones in cerebral regions. The inventors have demonstrated a localization platform that may assist clinicians in mapping cerebral regions and localizing epileptogenic zones with fewer constraints. The platform involves obtaining data through a non-invasive procedure which can then be used to apply virtual-impulses to virtual-inputs of a subjects\u2019 cerebral region. The virtual after-discharge from virtual outputs of the cortical stimulation mapping model generates an index of the cerebral region. In some implementations, the localization platform may generate the index in the form of a heat map that identifies unstable cerebral regions based on the virtual after-discharges, identify an epileptogenic zone based on the index, and/or provide other information to a clinician. In this way, the localization platform may enable clinicians to more thoroughly perform cortical stimulation mapping and more accurately identify an epileptogenic zone without additional costs, time, resources, and risks associated with in-vivo cortical stimulation mapping procedures. The inventors have shown through rigorous computational methods a platform that allows the use of non-invasive cerebral monitoring data to generate a cortical stimulation mapping model of the plurality of cerebral regions of a subject. This improves upon existing technology by implementing an interpretable tool that is reflective of what neurosurgeons do already in the clinic in-vivo. There is currently no computational tool used in the clinic to localize the epileptogenic zone.",

    "ip_description": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are amongst the most serious and challenging health problems in the world. There are nearly 37 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS and approximately 1 million AIDS-related deaths have occurred in 2017 alone - about 5,000 new infections per day (WHO website).\n\nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to substantial improvements in the life expectancy of patients infected with HIV, which is now treated as a chronic disease requiring lifelong ART treatment. Despite this advance, therapy \"fatigue\" or discontinuation of components of combination ART remains a serious problem both for the patient's immediate health (progression to AIDS) and for the appearance of new ART-resistant HIV strains.\n\nThere is a critical need to deliver and sustain effective levels of ART drug combinations over long periods of time which minimize the challenges in patient adherence due to pill fatigue or side-effects and the requirement of lifelong daily drug intake. A novel combination drug delivery platform that is administered periodically rather than daily and is long-lasting (slow release in physiological contexts) to provide safe and effective use would be an invaluable improvement in HIV therapy.\n\nThe inventors describe a methodology of synthetic polymerization chemistry to create a novel ART polymeric prodrug composed of prodrug monomers (polymer of prodrugs, \"POP\"). A prodrug is an inactive form of a drug molecule that can be converted to an active compound when exposed to the intended biological context. The invention characterizes polymer-drug conjugates of water-soluble polymeric carriers, biodegradable linkages, and antiviral drug cargos. Conjugated drugs are designed to undergo release via specific linkage bonds (e.g., bio-degradation) from the polymer backbone which could effectively prolong the circulation half-life and alleviate off-target cytotoxic side-effects.\n\nMore specifically, therapeutic polymeric carriers degrade to prodrug monomers of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) at rates appropriate to match long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine dosing frequencies and enable development of complete combination long-acting regimens. This polymeric compound has the planned capacity of carrying multiple antiviral prodrug monomers making it an effective long lasting drug delivery platform (i.e., less frequent dosing) capable of addressing patient pill fatigue while improving the standard of HIV therapy.",

    "ip_description": "Corneal blindness affects an estimated 10 million people worldwide, particularly prevalent in the underdeveloped world. Currently, only about 10% of patients receive a corneal transplant due to a shortage of human donor corneas and difficulty in preserving the tissues. Meanwhile, even in countries with a sufficient donor supply, some patients cannot tolerate human corneal grafts. About 8,000 people in the U.S. are unable to receive human donor corneas annually because the damage caused by their corneal diseases will cause the human tissue transplants to fail. The alternative to donor corneas are artificial plastic corneas, which can be mass produced without the difficult preservation requirements. In addition, there is no risk of rejection with artificial corneas in patients who are not good candidates for donor corneas. However, existing artificial corneas are not fully artificial because they require a human donor cornea as a carrier material to suture the artificial cornea into the recipient eye. Also, post-operation complications such as glaucoma, melt, retroprosthetic membrane formation, and infection occur more frequently in artificial corneas compared to donor corneas, and these complications may lead to failure and loss of vision even loss of the eye. Thus, there is an unmet need for fully artificial corneas that minimize post-operative complications. The artificial cornea is fabricated from a soft, flexible, and transparent derivative of Teflon that possesses similar optical properties to human cornea tissue. The material is chemically inert which enables it to be easily stored for long periods of time, and will not be rejected by the patient\u2019s immune system. It is comprised of an optical part that focuses light and a porous skirt that bonds to the patient\u2019s surrounding recipient cornea. The formation of biological bonds between the device and the patient\u2019s eye is distinct from existing artificial corneas because it enables the device to be transplanted without the use of human donor tissue as a carrier. Initial rabbit studies with this device did not demonstrate occurrence of glaucoma, retroprosthetic membrane or retinal detachment. The inventor jointly completed a prototype with W.L. Gore & Associates. In vivo preclinical studies were completed in rabbits, and the results indicated that the rabbits were free of common post-operation complications including immune rejection, retinal detachment, cataract and glaucoma. The inventors are planning on conducting human clinical trials by 2025 to gain U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance.",

A potentially useful tool in a wide range of surgeries as it can locate tumors, lesions, nerves, and blood vessels, current external light delivery systems severely limit the techniques\u2019 functionality. An external system renders the tool unusable when drilling holes deeper than a few millimeters as the laser light will be absorbed by the surrounding tissues before reaching the tool tip. Hopkins researchers have designed a new photoacoustic imaging device contained within a surgical drill bit. This invention allows for imaging the location of drill bits using only standard medical ultrasound transducers and a laser source instead of having to use X-Ray based imaging that subjects patient and surgeon alike to a radiation dose. The invention will also allow for imaging of structures such as nerves and blood vessels in front of the drill bit, which could potentially be used to stop or prevent motion of the drill into these structures. Researchers have demonstrated the first known detection of photoacoustic signals from within the vertebrae, and then performed the first known mapping of these signals onto a preoperative CT of the vertebra. These studies suggests that this device can be used in spinal fusion surgeries and vertebroplasties to prevent nerve damage while reducing radiation exposure to patients and surgeons.",

These alternate methods require specialized adjustments in IOL design or surgical techniques that generally are cumbersome, require high skill level, and are associated with a range of intra- and post-operative complications.

This device can be placed through a standard incision for cataract surgery. The capsule material is compatible with existing techniques for treatment in the event that the capsule loses clarity after implantation and the device can be removed from the eye using a small incision if needed.

    "ip_description": "Two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals are a versatile platform for optoelectronic, catalytic, and quantum device studies. These crystals are useful for their tunable bandgap, surface and edge reactivity, layer dependent properties, and potential to create multi-layer architectures that incorporate atomically abrupt interfaces. The micro/nano-structure and dimensionality of a TMD crystal determine many of its physical properties, while the phase and orientation of the TMD crystal layers are frequently manipulated to tune its electronic band structure. Explicit manipulation of crystallite size, shape, phase, and layer number is a major challenge, despite existing vapor-phase growth methods and exfoliation strategies that offer access to layered materials, such as 2D-TMDs. Though the TMD crystal desired properties are dictated by crystallite micro/nanostructure and dimensionality, there is a lack of synthetic methods to controlling these attributes. The Johns Hopkins researchers have demonstrated a gas-phase synthesis method to control the micro/nanostructure and dimensionality of 2D-TMD crystals. The synthesis method realizes directed growth of TMDs on phosphine-treated Si substrates to yield crystalline TMD nanoribbons with tunable widths. This method\u2019s directed growth mode differs significantly from typical omni-directional growth modes for forming triangular 2D-TMD crystals on SiO2 substrates. The cornerstone of this synthetic method involves the use of P atom functionalized Si surfaces, which directs the in-plane growth of TMD crystals during synthesis via a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) protocol. The researchers also developed a low-pressure CVD protocol for their TMD synthesis compatible with the P-functionalized Si surfaces. After the CVD and synthesis protocols, the crystals are confirmed using scanning election microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM), detailing the majority of products created are 2D-TMD crystals. The 2D crystals created were consistent with 2D crystals produced through standard chemical vapor transport protocols previously reported. The inventors have completed methods involved in the creation of 2D-TMD crystals, and controlling their structure and dimensionality while being created. One method is involved with seeding the crystals for growth, while the other protocol is involved in synthesizing the attributes (size, shape, phase, and layer number) of the seeded crystals for specific use.",

    "ip_description": "The present invention could be used for treatment of any solid tumor, including ovarian, breast, melanoma, lung, colon, pancreas, liver, esophageal, stomach, epithelial, sarcoma, cervical, and uterine. This encompasses a huge market size and compelling unmet need. The effectiveness of this combination therapy has been demonstrated specifically in models of ovarian cancer. While ovarian cancer has a relatively low incidence rate, it has a five-year survival rate of only 44%, making it the most-deadly gynecologic malignancy. One of the most challenging aspects of ovarian cancer treatment is that it is immunosuppressive: the tumor microenvironment is infiltrated with myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T-cells. The present invention addresses the need to overcome this immunosuppression to activate the immune system at the tumor site. This strategy has been effective against ovarian cancer, but could be applied to solid tumors of many types. Johns Hopkins researchers found that a mouse model of ovarian cancer treated with a combination of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor (ODCi) showed reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival. DNMTis, such as 5-azacytidine (AZA), are an established anti-cancer strategy that have been recently shown to upregulate immune signaling in cancer by triggering a type I interferon response. Ornithine decarboxylase catalyzes a rate limiting step in the synthesis of polyamines, which have an important antioxidant role in the cell. The inventors previously showed that AZA treatment can increase recruitment of immune cells to the tumor, and hypothesized that the addition of an ODCi could have a synergistic effect. In the mouse model of ovarian cancer, mice treated with AZA and the ODC-inhibitor DFMO show an increases number of total immune cells, a reduction in cells that suppress the immune response, and an increase in the percentage of activated immune cells compared with mice treated with AZA alone, DFMO alone, or a mock treatment. In other cancers, new DNMTis or ODCis could be substituted for AZA and DFMO, and HDAC inhibitors could be added. The inventors have demonstrated decreased tumor burden and increased survival in a mouse model of ovarian cancer.",

Due to its simplicity and efficiency, CRISPR-Cas9 systems have already shown promise in multiple fields, e.g., medicine, agriculture and even biofuels (through CRISPR-edited algae).\n\nCRISPR systems are evolving rapidly with increasing understanding of its mechanism of action(s), novel applications and innovative modifications. One important example of CRISPR modification is chemically-induced initiation of Cas9 cutting activity. While chemical induction is effective, it results in slow kinetics of CRISPR activity and requires the nuclear accumulation of active Cas9 after induction. This delays its overall efficiency and hinders the ability for tight control of CRISPR/Cas9 activity. As the market for biomedical engineering, and in particular, genome editing, continues to grow, it is necessary to develop faster, better and more accurate CRISPR-based technologies.\n\nJohns Hopkins scientists have developed a very rapid and efficient CRIPSR/Cas9 system utilizing light induced rather than chemically induced Cas9 activation. In their design, light-sensitive caged nucleotides are strategically placed to create artificial mismatches as a \u201croadblock\u201d. Upon UV light stimulation at 365 or 405nm, this roadblock is removed and the guide RNA can fully hybridize with the target DNA. Within 30 seconds of stimulation, cleavage of more than 50% of genomic DNA can be observed and indel formations reach ~90% within 6 hours, thereby demonstrating rapid and high efficiency of DNA cleavage and gene knockout. Additionally, Cas9 can be activated rapidly in single cells and/or locally within cells around a targeted genetic focus. Using fluorescence imaging and a focused laser, this technology can achieve extreme spatial control of gene manipulation which is unmatched by any current CRISPR technology.\n\nThis technology has been fully developed and validated for research and development.

    "ip_description": "DNA vaccine technology is a desirable antiviral and cancer immunotherapeutic strategy for its simple design and cost-effective implementation. However, current DNA vaccine programs are hindered by poor immunogenicity. Johns Hopkins researchers have designed a novel fusion construct to enhance immunogenicity to DNA vaccines. Increased DNA vaccine potency is achieved by coordinated administration with a recombinant DNA encoding the invariant chain protein (Ii) that associates with an MHC class II molecule and replaces MHC class II associating peptide region (CLIP) with a potent CD4+ T-cell activating peptide PADRE (invariant Pan HLA-DR reactive epitope). As shown in mice, Ii-PADRE potently and specifically increases CD4+ T-cell responses that in turn generate increased effector CD8+ T-cell functions against viral infection or cancer. To further enhance CD4+ T-cell responses using Ii-PADRE, DNA encoding MHC class II co-activating protein CIITA is included in administration to increase transcription of MHC class II complexes. Together, administration of Ii-PADRE, CIITA and a DNA vaccine of interest leads to increased anti-viral or anti-tumor responses generated from DNA vaccines. Novel DNA vaccine adjuvant to extensively enhance immune response. Suitable as an adjunct therapy to enhance effectiveness of traditional chemotherapy. Inexpensive and efficient production of enhancing components due to nucleic acid composition. Broad application of technology for both human and animal disease intervention.",

    "ip_description": "Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common pediatric brain tumor and requires aggressive therapy in high-risk cases. MB is frequently resistant to treatment and is associated with high morbidity and mortality in affected individuals. There are four distinct molecular subgroups of MB (WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4), which are characterized by specific mutations, copy number alterations, transcriptomic profiles, and clinical outcomes. Patients diagnosed with the WNT subgroup have the highest 5 year survival rates (~95% survival) while group 3 patients have the worst (45-60% survival). The WNT and SSH subgroups have clearly defined molecular phenotypes; however, there are currently no definitive characterizations of Group 3 and Group 4 subgroups. Due to the severity of the disease and the poor prognoses associated with patients affected with Group 3 MBs, there is a need for sensitive diagnostic tests capable of identifying these high-risk individuals so proper treatment can be carried out immediately. Johns Hopkins researchers have identified specific long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can differentiate MB subgroups with greater accuracy than current methods by analyzing 723 microarray and 123 RNA-seq MB datasets with machine-learning statistical algorithms. The newly identified lncRNAs were shown to be upregulated in Group 3 MBs when compared to other MB subgroups. The researchers confirmed these lncRNAs were specific to Group 3 over other subgroups or healthy brain tissue using RNA-FISH probes. Moreover, the researchers demonstrated that MB cells that have the Group 3-specific lncRNA knocked out have significantly reduced cell growth and increased apoptosis. Thus, these newly identified lncRNAs can be used as potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for children with Group 3 MB. The inventors have created CRISPR knockouts in MB mammalian cell lines of specific lncRNAs that are unique to Group 3 MB. LncRNA depleted cell lines show a dramatic reduction in in vivo tumor growth in mouse brain (cerebellum) confirm its potential as a therapeutic target. The inventors have also developed a panel of Group II and IV lncRNAs to test medulloblastoma specifically via RNA-FISH in solid tumor samples and by qPCR and digital PCR (ddPCR) in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).",

    "ip_description": "There are more than 600,000 annual cancer deaths in the United States. One of the biggest hurdles in combatting and curing different types of cancer is understanding the etiology of cancer. Cancer is the end-result of a process of accumulation of driver epigenetic mutations and other events. It is well-known that some of these driver mutations may be inherited and that a relevant fraction of them may be due to negative effects of poor lifestyle choices or harmful environmental exposures. However, a third factor that is often overlooked is the random mutations accumulating during the normal process of cell division, independently of inherited and environmental influences. There is a need for a method or procedure to measure and track these random mutations to determine if they could be a significant contributor in the origin of certain cancers. Inventors reasoned that a supervised approach, an approach that takes in knowledge of the presence and intensity of an exposure in a cancer patient, would be a powerful way to identify mutational signatures of factors for which clinical and sequencing information is available. They analyzed the sequencing data of thirty-one types of tissues. The total number of each of the six possible point mutations types, as well as the totals for each of the ninety six possible combinations was collected for each of the patients along with their age at cancer detection. Only patients without any known environmental or inherited factors were considered. The data was then analyzed by the inventors new methodology, which is based on logistic regression in order to determine the mutational signature associated with age in each tissue. The use of logistic regression in the methodology enables the inventors to automatically test the method\u2019s ability to predict and classify the age of each patient into two classes: young vs. old. This supervised method was about 82% successful, whereas the unsupervised methods have produced a 65% accuracy so far.",

Of these patients, 15,000-25,000 will have a subsequent major stroke that could\u2019ve been prevented with earlier identification and treatment. These strokes are often missed due to the fact that neuroimaging scans (CT/MRI) lack the sensitivity to diagnose stroke accurately, even within hours of the event. The HiNTS exam, a bedside test that assesses eye movements, has been shown to have greater sensitivity in diagnosis of stroke, but emergency department staff frequently do not have the expertise to administer this test. Therefore, there is a need in the field for new technological strategies to increase the accuracy of tests for stroke. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed an approach to improve stroke diagnoses in emergency departments (EDs) when patients present with dizziness or vertigo. The approach has three components: video oculography goggles, teleconsultations with neurologists, and a paired smartphone application. Together, the strategy can be used to simply give patients a HiNTS examination in the ED without any additional training of ED staff and could drastically reduce the rate of misdiagnosis of stroke.

Swarming applications are agent-based algorithms that are capable of developing robust, self-organized solutions to emerging critical needs in modern day society. A major challenge in swarm control is maximizing communication efficiency for large swarms of small-scale robotic agents, allowing them to cohesively navigate real-world environments and perform tasks. With the rise in research and development of swarming applications, new approaches to autonomous but human-guided control of many agents are in high demand. This technology is a novel methodological framework for local, bottom-up control of spatially distributed mobile autonomous systems. The research team discovered a new class of spatial neurons (coined \u201cphaser cells\u201d) and applied the neural codes of those cells to an oscillatory learning model of distributed swarms. The resulting algorithm accounts for swarm movement as a neural interaction of the timing (oscillatory phase) and learning (phase-coupled association) between agents, which is analogous to neural circuits of spatial cognition in mammals. The resulting swarm behavior is adaptive and resilient, allowing swarms to dynamically replan around obstacles or other changes in the environment, unlike conventional top-down methods.

    "ip_description": "Neuroprostheses, such as cochlear implants and neural pacemakers, have already been proven to be useful in varying applications. Current neuroprostheses tools typically employ biphasic pulsatile stimulation, a process where electrodes have both a cathodic phase and an anodic phase to pass charge in both directions. Direct current (DC) has also demonstrated great potential as a neuroprostheses tool; however, DC cannot be directly applied to neurons as metal electrodes have a charge injection threshold. Using DC as a means of neuromodulation over biphasic pulsatile stimulation can help to reduce neural sensitivity and spontaneous firing rate; DC also produces a firing pattern that is not phase locked to a stimulation frequency. There is a need to safely apply DC in neuromodulation technologies. Though biphasic pulsatile stimulation has been effective in some applications, there are many areas where biphasic stimulation is not suitable. Researchers from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine have developed a technology for a direct current stimulator that safely stimulates neural tissue without violating the charge injection limits of electrode-electrolyte interfaces. The design of this safety direct charge stimulator allows the system to produce a constant current amplitude despite changes in the gate configuration of the electrode configurations. The electronics reproduce the necessary states described in the state machine implementation and, overall, the design successfully supplies all the electronic control needs. This design will enable the development of ionic direct current as a mechanism for neuromodulation and allow DC to be used for neuromodulation. Systems and methods completed.

This system is highly effective for comparing aspects of physics sores such as length, width, size, and general shape. For larger, more complex images displaying a complicated sore or lesion, the system divides the image into a matrix of hundreds of sub-images, performing the first process on each shard.

    "ip_description": "Approximately 1.25 million people in the US have type 1 diabetes (T1D) and the rates of newly diagnosed cases in children are on the rise each year. T1D is caused by the development of an autoimmune reaction to pancreatic \u03b2 cells. The first detectable sign of \u03b2 cell autoimmunity is the appearance of diabetes-associated autoantibodies, which include antibodies to insulin, islet antigen 2, and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8). However, current assays to measure autoantibodies to ZnT8 are only able to measure antibodies to the C terminal domain (CTD), not the transmembrane domain (TMD). This is a major limitation because the CTD region is significantly smaller than the TMD region and the use of this assay will not identify all the autoantibodies to the extracellular domain of ZnT8. Consequently, an assay to detect autoantibodies to the native extracellular domain of ZnT8 would potentially improve our understanding of the mechanisms of T1D progression and be a useful diagnostic tool. Johns Hopkins and University of Colorado, Denver, researchers developed an assay to detect autoantibodies to the extracellular domain of ZnT8, including the TMD region. This assay stabilizes the extracellular domain\u2019s native structure, by using an antibody that complexes with the intracellular domain of ZnT8.

The nanoparticle and method of administration facilitates larger diameter (up to 200 nm) nanoparticles to penetrate deeper into tissue and diffuse further throughout the brain. The advantages of our technology over others is the widespread distribution of the nanoparticles, the almost 100% tumor tissue penetration, and the larger size allowing for higher concentrations of the therapeutic. Glioblastomas account for 45% of all brain cancers, and affect nearly 11,000 men, women and children every year. They are the most debilitating, complex, and treatment-resistant brain tumors. They can become widespread quickly and can grow in multiple areas at once making them difficult to remove completely using surgery or radiation therapy. Pharmaceutical therapies are also difficult to develop because the blood brain barrier prevents most drugs from entering the brain. One method to overcome the blood brain barrier is to use convection-enhanced diffusion (CED) to directly administer the therapeutics into the tumor, but recurrence of the tumor is still an issue and median patient life is still below 4 years at best. Combining CED with a novel drug delivery system has the potential of improving the administration of therapeutics using CED in brain tumors.

    "ip_description": "During minimally invasive orthopedic surgery, metallic instruments such as metallic wires and screws are implanted to restore bone morphology and restore function. Currently, the clinically acceptable placement of these instruments can only be verified reliably on post-operative CT images. Because post-operative verification prohibits immediate repositioning of the implant, there is a need for intra-operative 3D cone-beam CT (CBCT) that will allow immediate intra-operative verification and consequently immediate repositioning, thus removing the need for revision surgery. While the robotic CBCT-enabled C-arm X-ray systems are already installed in many state-of-the-art operating suites, they are not currently used for intra-operative verification due to the severe image artifacts in tomographic reconstructions that inhibit meaningful interpretation. These artifacts arise from discrepancies between the physical effects that govern image formation and the assumptions that must be made to enable algorithmic 3D reconstruction. The extent of mismatch between imaging physics and algorithmic assumptions depend on the 3D scene that is imaged and the view onto the scene. As a consequence, selecting views that do not violate the imposed assumptions as heavily will yield improvements in reconstructed image quality. Based on the above observations, the inventors have developed an improvement on CBCT that utilizes the mobile C-arm for intra-operative 3D CBCT while also providing accurate and clinically viable images. Specifically, they have built upon traditional short-scan CBCT trajectory by extending the planer trajectory and autonomously adjusting out-of-plane angulation. This allows for the C-arm source trajectories to be scene-specific and avoid unusable images characterized by beam hardening, photon starvation, and noise. This algorithm is performed in real-time using a deep convolutional neural network that regresses a detectability-rank derived from imaging physics. Not only does this method provide clinically viable reconstructed images in a task-aware and patient-specific manner, it also is performed in real-time utilizing the mobile C-arm x-ray system. The inventors have developed an in silico test bench for task-aware CBCT imaging protocols and have retrospectively evaluated their algorithm on semi-anthropomorphic phantoms.

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, recurrence following surgery remains 30-70%, and the five-year survival rate remains 23% with over 140,000 deaths occurring each year. Recurrence post-surgery can be driven by a number of factors, including pre-metastatic microenvironment alterations caused by bone marrow-derived myeloid cells. These myeloid cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), negatively modulate immune responses and can promote tumor progression and metastases. Therefore, MDSCs have emerged as an attractive target for a novel adjuvant therapy for NSCLC. The majority of early stage NSCLC tumors are resected without a neoadjuvant intervention. There is a need to identify adjuvant therapies that can be given following resection in order to decrease metastases and increase disease-free survival. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a low-dose adjuvant epigenetic therapy regimen to be used in combination with surgical resection of a primary tumor in NSCLC that reduces pulmonary metastases post-resection by inhibiting trafficking and promoting differentiation of MDSCs. In murine models, the treatment regimen prolongs the disease-free and overall survival time compared to resection alone or resection with adjuvant chemotherapy.",

    "ip_description": "Targeted, site-specific genome editing is an important scientific tool with broad applications in basic science, the pharmaceutical industry, and translational medicine. It enables the addition of florescent or other types of gene tags for purification, visualization, or tracking. Genome editing can also introduce novel functions for endogenous genes or replace mutated, malfunctioning genes in the case of genetic disorders. The CRISPR/Cas9-based knock-in system is becoming the most-widely used methodology for targeted gene editing. This system requires two separate components, a plasmid containing the single guide RNA (sgRNA) with the Cas9 enzyme and a repair template containing the desired gene knock-in, that are delivered to the cell via electroporation or lipofection. However, this system is complex and presents some important limitations. The sgRNA and Cas9 plasmid can remain in cells for extended periods which presents a risk of unwanted targeting of non-specific genes. These component parts can be difficult to generate and often need to be adapted across various systems. Additionally, electroporation can be harsh and damaging to cells, even resulting in cell death. Consequently, a simpler, more efficient method and delivery system for targeted, site-specific genome editing is greatly needed. Johns Hopkins researchers have deigned a single-vector knock-in method for CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing that requires one single vector that codes for the sgRNA, the Cas9 enzyme, and the repair template. This vector is packaged into a modified baculovirus-based system, which delivers the vector to the cells and genomes of interest. This is a non-integrating viral system, adaptable to most types of mammalian cells, that is capable of carrying all that is needed for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. The system also initiates self-digestion by the Cas9 protein it encodes in order to prevent non-specific effects. The inventors have optimized the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system to use only one single plasmid vector containing all the necessary parts and information needed for editing that is delivered into cells using a non-integrating viral vector. Further testing of this novel system is needed to determine its effectiveness in editing the mammalian genome, specifically in regards to replacing mutated genes in the case of genetic disorders.",

Monitoring mouse social behaviors is one of the more important neurobehavioral analyses. However, classical behavioral testing of disease models is time-consuming and labor intensive while also being vulnerable to human handling error. There is a need to remove the human element that causes issues and inaccuracies in processing phenotyping and behavioral testing within the home cage environment. Due to the extensive use of mice for disease modeling brings a need for a computational system that is able to analyze and classify their social behavior to remove human element mistakes. There is an unmet need for an automated system to improve efficiency and accuracy of mouse model analysis, which in turn will improve overall disease discovery improvement in several different diseases. The inventors have developed a state-of-the-art monitoring and automated tracking system that is able to identify mice and track their identities frame by frame. This lays the groundwork for automatic social behavior analysis. The inventors specifically have found that mice have been the big limit of the state-of-the-art systems due to the difficulty of tracking individual animals. This technology addresses several unmet needs, such as automating the entire process along with developing a sophisticated algorithm for identity preservation of mice in disease analysis of behavioral and neurological assessment. The technology has proven to achieve over 80% accuracy on metal ear tags identification for full minute long video recordings. The inventors have developed an automated tracking system for identification of tagged mice for automatic social behavior. They are currently working to grow and exploit the system to be more accurate and implementable in more situations.",

In the US, over 80,000 new cases will be diagnosed and approximately 17,000 will die from the disease in 2018. Bladder cancer is diagnosed via the use of cystoscopy. However, this procedure is considered too costly and invasive to be utilized in routine screening. Urine cytology and ImmunoCyt are noninvasive alternatives to cystoscopies, but are limited by their low sensitivity. In addition, none of these current tests are capable of detecting cancer stem-like cells (CSC), which may be a driver of tumor initiation, metastasis and therapeutic resistance. Consequently, a noninvasive method that is able to detect CSCs in bladder cancer is a promising approach to diagnose tumor growth earlier. Johns Hopkins researchers were able to identify a specific protein, CD24, that could be responsible for the properties of cancer stem-like cells (CSC) in the bladder. This protein is responsible for the proliferation of various other CSC-related molecules. Via the use of a training cohort of urine samples, the inventors were able to identify a panel of three molecules (CD24, CD49f, and NANOG) that can be used to diagnose urothelial carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer. When tested in an independent cohort of over 291 samples, this panel had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 86% for urothelial carcinoma. Researchers validated their noninvasive diagnostic panel in 291 patient samples.",

A source document that proves patient eligibility is required for every clinical trial enrollment and has been documented on paper historically. This process is a bottleneck for large clinical trials that can enroll thousands of patients. There is a need to automate the clinical trial eligibility screening and enrollment process and digitize the source documentation.

Once the information is entered, the application uses a customized algorithm to determine if the potential patient is eligible or ineligible. The application programs directly into Microsoft Word to immediately generate a source document marked with the eligibility determination and saves the document to a designated folder. If the algorithm determines the patient is eligible, the application programs directly into Microsoft Outlook to generate an enrollment email with the source document attached to notify the study team of the enrollment.

The success of gene therapy is dependent on the safety, efficacy, and specificity of the treatment. The delivery vehicle, also known as a vector, is a highly enabling factor in the progression of better, safer, and more effective gene therapy. Non-viral vectors, compared to viral vectors, have a reduced risk of an immune response, mutation of the genes, have a flexible genetic load capacity, and can be engineered to target any cell. Non-viral vectors have an estimated market of $4.9 billion in 2023. However, the development of non-viral vectors into commercially realizable products has been slow non-viral vectors are not as effective as viral vectors. Improving the efficacy of non-viral vectors requires a highly uniform volume of vectors and a high degree of control over the surface properties, shape, amount of genetic material, and size of each individual vector. The lack of a controlled process for manufacturing non-viral vectors has resulted in a high variability in transfection efficacy, cell uptake, and cytotoxicity. Therefore, there is a need for a manufacturing and characterization process that gives control over multiple aspects of the final vector design in a predictable way. Reducing the variability in production of the delivery systems for gene therapies can improve the efficacy of gene therapy using non-viral vectors. The inventors\u2019 technology can precisely tune the vector size, composition, and genetic payload of a non-viral vector using adjustable flow streams in a microchamber. Furthermore, this highly-controlled process has a 70% yield, high uniformity in the composition of the final solution, and low batch to batch variability. The non-viral vectors have a shelf life of over 9 months without any performance degradation and a reduced risk of immune response. The inventors have developed a well-characterized, two-stage process for manufacturing non-viral gene delivery nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 30 \u2013 130 nm with varying genetic payloads.

Currently, about 9% of patients undergoing neurosurgical operations experience surgical complications related to the retractor (a paddle-like tool used to open a working corridor within the brain tissue) causing tissue hemorrhaging, swelling, or infarction. This high complication rate forces surgeons to decide between aggressively treating and removing a deep-seated brain tumor and risking an unintended injury or approaching the problem more conservatively and risking incomplete tumor resection. A safer way to access deep brain lesions would improve patient safety by reducing retractor related injuries. Johns Hopkins researchers have designed a minimally invasive brain retractor that allows surgeons to access deep-seated lesions in a less disruptive manner. This ergonomic tool has been designed with the patient and the surgeon in mind and boasts a small point of entry while providing dynamic control of the device. Once inserted, the surgeon can radially expand and contract the device on demand allowing for precise control over the size of the working corridor. Radial expansion disperses pressure equally on the tissue and limits hemorrhage and swelling. Use of these flexible, tubular retractors will enable minimally invasive surgery of previously intractable deep-seated brain lesions by reducing surgical complications.",

    "ip_description": "Effective drug delivery to solid tumors remains challenging. Outcome failure rates can reach 90% for current therapeutic approaches for solid tumors. The use of nanoparticles for the delivery of therapeutic agents can enhance the safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and bioavailability of administered drugs, leading to improved therapeutic tolerance and efficacy. These benefits are limited by the nanocarrier\u2019s inability to uniformly penetrate the tumors, which can often have dysfunctional vasculature and lymph vessels, resulting in non-uniform drug microdistributions within the tumor volume and, therefore, in partial cell kill leading to tumor recurrence. Currently, there is no effective way to ensure full tumor infiltration following systemic administration of a therapeutic. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed an \u201cadsorptive/adhesive switch\u201d for drug delivery nanoparticles, which slows down their tumor-clearing kinetics. The switch allows for the promotion of ECM-adsorption of the nanoparticles while minimizing cell internalization resulting in longer residence times of the nanoparticles in the tumors. This property is utilized as follows. Given that these drug-loaded nanoparticles release the free drug (which is usually highly-diffusing, and, therefore, highly-penetrating) in the tumor interstitium, this adsorptive/adhesive switch results in maximizing the fraction of drug that can penetrate deep into the tumor enabling more uniform and more prolonged tumor infiltration to the free drug. The technology is at the preclinical stage of development. The switch-conjugated nanocarriers have been evaluated in vitro and in vivo in different mouse xenograft models of breast cancer. The researchers have confirmed that the primary effect of the adhesive switch is to increase tumor uptake and delay tumor clearance in vivo without affecting blood clearance kinetics of the nanoparticles. When loading nanocarriers with different therapeutics (chemotherapy, alpha-particle therapy), the researchers have also shown that the nanocarriers with the adhesive switch exhibit better inhibition of tumor growth and/or of metastatic spreading compared to nanocarriers without the adhesive switch.",

This probe is beneficial for its utilization of ultrasound neuromodulation to produce noninvasive excitation. Combining the ultrasound and optical modalities of photoacoustic allows for the probe to accurately provide information on the brains of newborn brains. Treatment of developmental brain injury has had many recent advances with developments in obstetric and neonatal medicine. However, perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains a significant cause of this brain injury. Fetal brain injury that is caused during labor is currently monitored by electronic fetal heart rate monitoring. This methodology, however, is very nonspecific and has a high false-positive rate for predicting childhood neurological abnormalities- as high as 99% in some studies. In addition, other methodologies such as near-infrared spectroscopy are limited in application and also have insubstantial accuracy. Furthermore, imaging techniques such as MRI cannot be performed until 7-10 days after birth to detect HIE.

In the U.S., prostate cancer is the most common and diagnosed cancer in males. It is estimated there are 2.5 million men living with prostate cancer in the US, and the number is on the rise. The survival of prostate cancer depends on its stage in diagnosis and treatment options. One common treatment of prostate cancer is the removal of the prostate through minimally invasive surgery using surgical robots to better aid in recovery and reduce surgical side effects such as the occurrence of impotence (erectile dysfunction) and incontinence among patients following surgery. The preservation of the cavernous nerves during prostate cancer surgery is essential in maintaining a man\u2019s sexual potency. Because of the proximity of the cavernous nerves to the prostate, these microscopic nerves are at high risk of damage during surgical procedures. Improvements in identifying the cavernous nerves and distinguishing prostate nerves from normal or cancerous prostate tissue during surgery would aid in preservation, resulting in improved sexual function postoperatively. JHU researchers developed a novel imaging guidance approach to precisely visualize and preserve the cavernous nerve map in real time during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RaRP). JHU researchers utilized several current imaging modalities to develop an innovative approach to overcome the limitations of RaRP. This approach uses a novel voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) to visualize the nerves, ultrasound neuromodulation (UNM) to stimulate nerves, and Fluorescence imaging technologies to identify and image the cavernous nerves during RaRP. The inventors have carried out preliminary studies addressing the multiple aspects of technologies that will be used with the RaRP protocol. The inventors have tested and characterized the fluorescence behaviors (absorption/emission spectrum) of several novel dyes (VSDs). In addition, in vitro studies using VSDs and cellular stimulation with ultrasound targeting neurons cultured with kidney cells provides a proof-of-principle that neurons could be distinguishable from surrounded tissues/cells. To support in vitro studies, in vivo proof-of-concept using a rodent (rat) prostate model with the combination of optic imaging and electrical stimulation allowed for the localization of the cavernous nerve map and the prostate. More studies are needed in large animal models followed by clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of identifying and sparing nerves during RaRP.",

    "ip_description": "The technology is an external camera that performs image acquisition and processing and transfers the visual information in real-time via a processor to a photoacoustic imager that is implanted in the eye cavity. The photoacoustic imager converts the received information into a series of laser pulses that are projected via small implanted galvo-mirrors or MEMs actuators onto a light-absorptive layer that covers the macula. The laser pulses are then converted via the photoacoustic effect into highly localized ultrasonic waves (or, alternatively, piezoelectric signals). The waves induce expansion of the light-absorptive layer, which will cause the underlying retinal nerve cells to depolarize, sending a visual signal to the brain. Unlike with existing solutions, this approach eliminates the invasive surgical implantation of electrode arrays in the subretina, minimizing potential loss of vision from operative complications. Also, because the device is located in the eye cavity rather than on the subretinal layers, it offers potentially limitless stimulation control and does not have to rely on resolution limiting electrode contact points. Using the photoacoustic effect also allows the approach to provide enhanced stimulation resolution with deeper penetration than available with conventional current-based methods. The inventors have proposed a design and developed a prototype of the photoacoustic stimulation apparatus. In vitro tests on mouse neuronal tissue demonstrated higher nerve membrane potential changes at shorter photoacoustic pulse widths, providing proof of concept of using photoacoustic excitation to stimulate a visual signal.

Non-viral strategies of gene delivery, particularly nanoparticle-based approaches, may provide several advantages relative to viral delivery, including enhanced safety profiles, cost-effective production, and more localized gene expression. However, the clinical applications of non-viral gene carriers are limited by low in vivo transfection efficiency, which limits therapeutic efficacy.

Accuracy and precision can be further facilitated by reducing the physiological hand tremor which predominates in a frequency band of about 6-12 Hertz, on the order of 100 \u03bcm of motion that is neither directed nor intended. The reduction in tremor motion is particularly important in procedures where surgeons use unassisted hand tools, like micro-forceps, to peel micron-scale membranes from the delicate retinal surface, without damaging fragile neurons. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), which is a prevailing diagnostic imaging modality in clinical ophthalmology, has recently been shown to be potentially useful as a sensor for intraoperative tool control. There is a need for a method to utilize the benefits of OCT as it pertains to tool-tip stability in microsurgery. Johns Hopkins researchers describe handheld micro-forceps that are guided by fiber-optic common-path optical coherence tomography (CP-OCT). These micro-forceps are designed for precise distance-sensing, particularly at the small scales needed for microsurgery. A fiber-optic CP-OCT distance and motion sensor is integrated into the shaft of a micro-forceps. This sensor assesses tool tip motion relative to the target and compensates for unwanted and unintended tremor using a high-speed piezoelectric motor, allowing for more accurate and precise instrument control. This novel design significantly enhances the safety and efficiency of microsurgery, and consequently improves surgical outcomes. The basic grasping and peeling functions of micro-forceps were evaluated in dry phantom and biological tissue models. Compared to freehand use, active tremor compensation of this invention significantly improved user performance in targeted grasping and peeling performance by enabling more accurate and precise tool control.",

Specifically, synthetic polymers have been beneficial for the delivery of therapeutic proteins and small molecule drugs. These polymers fall under immediate release technology and only account for $116 million of the global advanced drug delivery market in 2015. Vinyl monomers with BN aromatic side chains are not very well explored. Exploration of BN aromatic side chains is motivated by reactivity, photophysics, and post-functionalization. The need for controlled changes in wettability is paramount for enhanced polymer micelles for drug delivery. Facile synthesis of BN aromatic bond formation followed by selective C-B bond oxidation or post-functionalization is described. Treatment of homopolymer BN2VN, a BN derivative, under strong oxidizing conditions led to selective C-B bond cleavage and the formation of hydrophilic polymers. The ease of synthesis allows for readily made tunable polymers for enhanced drug delivery. The motivations for exploring BN aromatic side chains have been met through studies of the reactivity, photophysics, as well as post-functionalization. The inventors have developed a facile two-step multigram scale synthesis of BN2VN.

Other ethylenic compounds also include components of industrial emissions and components of breath. Current methods of ethylene detection such as photoacoustic spectroscopy, gas chromatography and electrochemical sensors all have their respective limitations \u2013 they are too expensive, bulky, have low sensitivity, or rely on high temperatures in order to function. Though a recent sensor by Swager et. al. was designed to bypass these issues, it failed to successfully address the issue of selectivity. Gasses such as acetonitrile (100 ppm) and acetaldehyde (75 ppm) had much higher responses compared to that of the lower limit (1ppm) of ethylene. There is a need to design a flexible, inexpensive sensor for vapor-phase ethylenic molecules, in particular, ethylene. Electronic sensors are generally cheaper and thus, easily scalable. They are monitored with inexpensive equipment and then analyzed and archived by computers. Due to the limited physiochemical reactivity of ethylene, ethylene electronic sensing has always been a challenge for the horticulture industry. Researchers from Johns Hopkins have made progress in addressing this issue. They have designed an electronic sensor for ethylenic compounds by using a particular material to interact with an ethylenic compound so that the impedance of the element changes. In one embodiment, this invention provides an enhanced electronic response in the chemiresistive element to ethylene vapor present with concentrations of as little as 50ppm. The detection of ethylenic compounds can be applied beyond the field of horticulture, and also has varying applications in medical diagnosis.",

In general, the more porous a material, the higher the surface area. However, the increase in surface area from making something more porous with smaller and smaller pores does not always increase the desired function once pores reach a critical size.\n\nThe standard method for measuring the surface area of porous materials is the BET method. While the BET method works well for macroporous materials, as the size of the pores approach the microscale and smaller (50 nm and smaller), the values obtained from BET measurements are false. Due to the condensation of adsorbate molecules in the pores of these microporous materials during the BET test, the value obtained tends to be a measure of void volume or pore volume instead of surface area.\n\nJohns Hopkins researchers have developed a method to measure the thermodynamic adsorption capacity as opposed to the geometric capacity measured by the BET method. This thermodynamic capacity is a measurement of how much of a given adsorbate molecule can be adsorbed at the point where the repulsions of other molecules is balanced by the attractive forces of the surface of a material. The measurements can be done using field conditions for molecule capturing materials, such as the desired molecule/temperature/pressure/etc., to give a true measurement of adsorptive capacity.",

Catalysts are capable of speeding up reactions, allowing them to operate at lower temperatures, and increasing yields, and doing one or all of these things without being consumed. While catalysts can be expensive, small amounts of the catalytic material can be used, drastically reducing the overall cost of manufacturing goods and allowing for higher profits. Additionally, catalysts may also enable chemical transformations not otherwise possible.\n\nOperating conditions for catalysts are often optimized by systematically testing different variables such as temperature, pressure, or concentration of a reactant and analyzing the results. This method is often time consuming, and can be costly, while not promising the optimal conditions. The lower the temperature or pressure an industrial scale reaction can be run, the lower the energy cost.\n\nA researcher at Johns Hopkins has developed a method to screen different catalysts by finding the conditions where adsorption compression occurs. Under the adsorption compression regime, the adsorbed molecules will experience a high molecular force, which serves to strain molecular bonds, potentially lowering the activation energy of a catalytic reaction. By operating under these conditions, it is possible to run reactions at much lower temperatures than expected, while maintaining or increasing the turnover rate of a catalytic reaction. In addition, utilizing the adsorption compression regime for catalysis, it may be possible to discover previously unattainable chemical transformations.\n\nResearchers have shown that using this method to identify conditions of adsorption compression and operating catalytic reactions under these conditions can increase the rate of a reaction by up to a factor of 20.",

    "ip_description": "While open heart surgery is the gold standard to replace a diseased heart valve and has long-term beneficial outcomes for the patient. In 2011 the FDA approved a minimally invasive procedure, called the trans-catheter valve replacement, for patients that could not undergo open heart surgery. Risks associated with a replacement valve include restriction of the movement of the valve flaps because of build-up of deposits, a leak between the valve and the surrounding tissue, called paravalvular leak (PVL), deterioration of the valve, infection, and the formation of blood clots, known as thrombosis, that can cause a sudden stroke or heart attack. The procedure also uses ECG images during the procedure to guide the placement of the valve. Due to the difficulty of measuring the valve area using ECG, there is a high rate of patient-prosthetic size mismatch or incorrect positioning. This regularly leads to secondary operations due to severe PVL or an overgrowth around the valve. These issues are exacerbated due to the lack of data on the longevity and structural durability of transcatheter heart valves, and early detection of improper valve function is difficult because the changes are too small to measure using current methods. There were over 378,000 heart valve replacement surgeries performed in 2018, and with the increased life expectancy of the average person the number of heart valve replacement surgeries are expected to increase 4.8% annually. The market for the transcatheter valves used in the minimally invasive procedure was $3.9 billion in 2018, and there is an expected increase of 14.8% annually due to the increasing adoption of this procedure. It is predicted the market for the transcatheter valve will reach $7.9 billion by 2023. Researchers at Hopkins have developed a computational model of a heart valve with different disease states, and used this to determine the optimal placement of pressure sensors for the early detection of complications in the heart valve during and after the operation. The measured flow and pressure from the sensors can be mapped to a model simulation to diagnose the health of the artificial valve. There are no current artificial valve technologies available that can act as a positioning guide and a predictor of ventricular and vascular health. Computational models developed for detecting a paravalvular leak, restricted valve movement, degree of valve opening/closure, and being able to distinguish functioning from non-functioning flaps.",

Patients are often treated using NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and other anti-inflammatory drugs, which can be cumbersome and ineffective.

Certain genes\u2019 characteristic expression in fibrotic environments has led researchers to conclude that these genes are responsible for driving fibrosis in affected patients. Thus, the targeting and inhibition of the macrophage F2 cluster could halt and possibly reverse the effect of fibrosis in patients.

Cardiotoxicity is the most common reason for withdrawing candidate drugs from the development pipeline, with 30% of drugs withdrawn during the clinical development phase. Improvements in methodologies for assessing drug cardiotoxicity during preclinical testing would both remove dangerous drugs early on from the pipeline and retain effective drugs, providing cost savings. The general approach to cardiotoxicity testing has been to evaluate a drug\u2019s cardiotoxicity in animal models and in binding assays. However, this approach does not capture the biological complexity of human cardiac cells and can result in inaccurate assessment. Recently, new assays have been developed that use human-derived cardiac preparations to improve drug screening. However, these assays measure spontaneous activity of cardiac preparations and do not account for variables that influence drug responses. Consequently, novel, more accurate analytical tools are needed to assess the response of cardiac preparations to candidate drugs. The Grid of Responses Indicating Drug Sensitivity (GRIDS) assay is a method for testing the sensitivity of a cardiac preparation to drugs. This analysis software provides a framework for analyzing the responsiveness of cardiac preparations to a range of drug doses and pacing rates. This approach can be used on numerous cardiac preparations, including single cells, monolayers, cell clusters, engineered tissues, and tissue explants. GRIDS analysis can also be used to compare the level of electrophysiological maturity of cardiac preparations. Importantly, because it incorporates a categorical readout, GRIDS analysis can be adapted for high-throughput drug screens.

OCT produces high-resolution depth images of the retina and is now the standard of care for in vivo ophthalmological assessment. It is also increasingly being used for evaluation of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The images obtained via OCT are used to segment layers of maculae (area responsible for high-acuity color vision) in human eyes. Automatic segmentation methods can identify the retinal layers of the macular cube providing consistent results without intra- and inter-rater variation and is faster than manual segmentation, allowing faster and better evaluations- though these technologies are still being developed. There is a need for a method of segmenting the images obtained via OCT in an efficient and accurate manner, particularly for evaluation of multiple sclerosis. This invention is a fast, multilayer macular OCT algorithmic segmentation method based on a fast level set method. The framework for this method uses contours in an optimized approach specifically for OCT layer segmentation over the whole macular cube. Evaluation on both healthy and multiple sclerosis subjects shows that this method is statistically better than a state-of-the-art graph-based method. The method has been utilized to evaluate data from the right eyes of 36 patients (21 MS patients and 15 healthy controls). The method was trained using data from 9 MS patients and 6 healthy controls, using the remaining patient data as part of the validation set. A cumulative 12,960 experiments were run using this data to confirm the model. The algorithm demonstrated excellent performance in terms of both mean absolute boundary error and layer Dice coefficient. In addition, less computation cost is required, which makes it an ideal alternative for graph cut search in boundary refinement after feature classification. Although this technique does not outperform deep learning based methods in terms of speed (since the latter needs only a few seconds to run on a GPU), this method provides topologically correct results and subvoxel resolution that most deep learning based methods cannot achieve.",

MRI is a non-invasive method to image EVs and study their movement and distribution throughout the body to understand the pharmacokinetics of EVs. Current methods of labeling extracellular vesicles (EVs) for MRI imaging, however, produce low intensity signal and can produce false positives due to free labeling agents outside the vesicles. Purification methods need to be developed that produce a high yield of labeled EVs without contamination of external labeling agents, and the signal to noise ratio for MRI imaging is necessary. The inventors have created a method to improve the purification and enrichment of EVs using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) for MRI imaging. This method produces highly purified EVs by functionalizing the SPIOs with specific binding moieties that allow for an additional separation and purification of the labeled EVs from the free floating SPIOs. Highly purified labeled EVs are essential to mitigate false positives, and increased enrichment of EVs with SPIOs enhances image quality. This method improves accurate detection and measurement of the spatiotemporal quantity and distribution of EVs in the body. This is essential for locating and measuring the therapeutic effects of EVs used for targeted drug delivery or to track and monitor biomarkers for particular diseases.

The only robust method for preventing the presence of dense speckle noise were extremely expensive and cumbersome optical laser speckle noise reducers. Consequently, most optical imaging systems continue utilizing LED and Arc lamps for illumination, despite them being less efficient, larger and difficult to collimate.

Utilizing deep neural networks, researchers at Johns Hopkins have established methodologies to digitally strip images of dense laser speckle noise after imaging. During a brief training period neural networks are developed and trained to recognize the difference between laser-illuminated images and noise free LED-illuminated images. Then, using statistical transformation the technology is capable of recognizing, and subsequently removing noise present on laser-illuminated images. Initial testing shows results on par or better than optical laser speckle noise reducers, for a fraction of the cost and without the need for new cumbersome hardware.

    "ip_description": "About 3.2 million cases of intestinal obstruction occurred in 2015, which resulted in 264,000 deaths. A majority of the patients that die of intestinal obstruction have gastric distension, which is an upstream back-up of fluids within the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in pooling of fluid in the stomach. There are currently two ways the fluid is released from the body. One way is nasogastric tubes; however, these tubes, inserted in the nostril of a patient, cause harm of their own. Many patients remove the tubes accidentally, which result in replacement and exposure to the harms associated with interrupted drainage. Other patients have feeding gastrostomy tubes which are a unique connection from their stomach cavity to the outside world, allowing for feeds to pass directly into the stomach. The tubes are occasionally used to vent the stomach in situations of obstruction, but their design does not effectively drain gastric fluids. Thus, for those with an existing gastronomy site, there is a need to better treat gastric decompression by utilizing the site with a tube designed for draining instead of feeding. Inventors have created two products for optimal drainage. The first is called the GSump, which is a tube specifically designed to drain gastrointestinal contents through a previously existing gastrostomy site. When a patient with a gastrostomy feeding tube in place develops obstructive symptoms, the gastrostomy feeding tube is removed, and replaced with the device. It comes in a variety of widths, and is placed through the gastrostomy site, extending into the stomach several centimeters. The suction lumen is connected to wall suction outside the body, and contains a \u201csump\u201d lumen which is open to air outside of the body, allowing air to flow into the stomach and prevents the suction port from collapsing the stomach. The device has a balloon port used to hold the device in place. The second product is called the sump facilitator, which is a holster device, designed to hold a standard nasogastric tune in the stomach lumen. The gastrostomy feeding tube will be removed in the case of obstructive symptoms, and the device will be placed into the gastrostomy site. The nasogastric tube is inserted through the sump facilitator and the balloon on the facilitator is inflated. The balloon will hold the drainage tube in place. The drainage tube is connected to wall suction, as with a standard nasogastric drainage tube, to achieve drainage without collapse of gastric cavity. Prototypes are in development.",

    "ip_description": "Vocal cord paralysis results in a compromised airway, hindering speaking and breathing. To alleviate the effects of paralysis, surgical operations can manipulate the position of the vocal cords by moving them to the side (lateralization) or center (medialization) of the airway. Current state of the art procedures achieve vocal cord lateralization by destroying vocal fold tissue, which is irreversible and increases stress on native vocal fold tissue. These procedures do not allow for adjustment of the vocal cord position to optimize the patient\u2019s voice quality following the procedure. Also, many vocal fold lateralization techniques are associated with post-operative complications, including fistulas. Approximately 16,000 patients develop vocal cord paralysis following thyroid surgery in the United States annually, and certain surgeries, such as cardiothoracic operations, have estimated rates of post-operative vocal cord paralysis exceeding 20%. Hence, there is a need for a fully reversible and adjustable method to manipulate vocal cords (through both lateralization and medialization) in patients with permanent vocal fold paralysis that minimizes stress on native tissue and lowers the risk of post-operative complications such as fistulas. A magnetic device is implanted into the arytenoid cartilage adjacent to the vocal cords through a minimally invasive \u201ckeyhole\u201d procedure, alongside a magnetic piston that is implanted in the throat. The magnetic interaction between the implant and the piston allows the device to reversibly move the vocal process region of the arytenoid cartilage, thus lateralizing the arytenoid. Medialization can be achieved by reversing the device\u2019s polarity to push the arytenoid implant medially. Unlike existing procedures which are irreversible and not adjustable, the device can alter the degree of lateralization or medialization for different patients by implanting magnets of differing strengths and polarity. The magnetic system enables fully adjustable and reversible lateralization and medialization of the vocal cords, which allows the final position of the vocal cord to be modified to maximize the quality of the patient's voice following the procedure. Compared to existing devices that use larger screws, the amount of tissue stress created by the magnetic implant is significantly less. Additionally, in contrast to current procedures, which require device components to be introduced at great depth into the soft tissue, the magnetic system can act across soft tissue without disrupting the tissue integrity, which reduces the likelihood of post-operative complications like fistula formation.",

Current mosquito surveillance generally involves the placement and collection of traps spread across a particular region. The insect samples are then tested in a laboratory to determine what types of mosquitoes were caught, the diseases associated with them, and if the insect population is expanding or shrinking. This type of work is remarkably resource and time intensive, as researchers need to physically place and collect each trap. Moreover, this manual sampling approach produces large temporal gaps in the population dynamics data and allows potentially dangerous changes to be overlooked or detected late. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a mobile platform capable of capturing, analyzing, and transmitting data related to mosquito populations in a desired area. Once placed, this device lures mosquitoes into a trap where they are immobilized and a camera can image the insects. The researchers used machine-learning approaches to train the camera software to identify different types of mosquitoes. The platform wirelessly transmits data to allow for real-time analysis of mosquito populations. This approach saves countless hours and resources spent manually placing, checking, and replacing traps across a region and eliminates potentially dangerous time gaps in the data set.",

    "ip_description": "The current drug development process is expensive, laborious, and only about 1 in 10 drugs that enter clinical trials ultimately receive FDA approval. One important factor that drives this high failure rate and the high costs associated with drug development is that traditional cell culture and animal-based methods for drug testing do not fully recapitulate human pathophysiology. One promising approach to improve preclinical drug testing is the use of organ-on-a-chip devices. Organ-on a chip devices are 3D cell culture chips that are capable of recapitulating the physical microenvironment of an organ. These devices can increase the speed and accuracy of drug testing, and provide researchers with a cost-effective method of introducing therapeutics and observing reactions in real time. However, organ-on-a-chip devices are in the early stages of development and frequently fail to have all the functional hallmarks of a complete organ/tissue barrier. Moreover, organ-on-a-chip devices generally do not provide functional readouts of the organ that they recapitulate. Consequently, there is a need for novel methods and approaches to improve organ-on-a-chip designs. JHU researchers have developed a new microfluidic organ-on-a-chip device to measure the trans-epithelial fluid transport activity. The device is capable of measuring and controlling molecular flux across the epithelium as well as the flow and hydraulic pressure of fluid across a monolayer of cells. The device comprises of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) block with specific features, porous membrane, a flat transparent base and a micro-capillary. The device has multiple compartments to simulate physiologically relevant conditions. The micro-capillary can measure flux and/or pressure in one or more than one compartment of the device. The device can also be fabricated with a plurality of porous membranes. The device is compatible with microscopy and can be used design experiments with a plurality of physiologically relevant conditions.",

    "ip_description": "Over 800,000 people are diagnosed with liver cancer annually. As the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, liver cancer accounts for more than 700,000 deaths annually. Recently, Johns Hopkins researchers have developed new chemotherapeutic drugs to treat liver cancer that demonstrate higher efficacy than the current standard of care for both hepatocellular cancer and cholangiocarcinoma (sorafenib and fluropyrimidines/gemcitabine). However, effective usage of these drugs requires identifying the optimal methods of drug delivery to enhance their anti-tumor activity. While systemic administration is viable and the most straightforward strategy, it is almost always accompanied by adverse side effects. In contrast, a method of locally delivering the drug to the tumor or the tumor environment and its corresponding blood vessels can deliver higher levels of the drug to the tumor with significantly fewer systemic side effects. Also, chemotherapeutic drugs are often enhanced when used in combination with other drugs, and can be made more useful by formulating them with imaging contrast agents. Understanding the possible formulations of the drugs can increase their treatment effectiveness and utility to imaging specialists such as interventional radiologists. Thus, there is a need to identify formulations and methods of delivery for the recently developed chemotherapeutic drugs that will enhance their anti-cancer effectiveness and utility while minimizing side effects. Several drugs are disclosed for treating liver cancer both locally and systemically, including HDAC and proteasome inhibitors. Methods of delivering the drugs for local treatment of liver tumors include direct injection, which may be performed under imaging guidance, and intravascular delivery (ex. transarterial infusion) to the blood vessels supplying the tumor. These local delivery methods will help target chemotherapeutic treatment to the tumor site, minimizing off-target effects and increasing the quantity of the drug that reaches the tumor. Additionally, the drugs may be formulated in combination with other drugs intended for local liver cancer treatment, or with lipiodol, embolization beads, delayed delivery compounds, or opaque contrast materials. Formulations of the chemotherapeutic drugs with other compounds that aid their delivery will enhance the effectiveness of the drugs in treating liver cancer and can allow for improved procedural decision-making. The inventors have proposed various formulations of and methods of administering novel chemotherapeutic drugs.",

    "ip_description": "Gene therapies are regarded as a potential revolution in the health sciences and pharmaceutical fields. The number of gene therapy trials has been steadily increasing in the United States, with around 170 trials taking place in 2015. All of these trials aim to treat the causes of different diseases instead of only relieving symptoms. Many trials focus on targeting gene therapies towards the liver to cure inborn errors, such as metabolism or hemophilia, or acquired diseases, such as liver cancer and hepatitis. However, though many researchers have investigated intravascular hydrodynamic gene delivery in large animal models, translation to humans has been hampered by its technical challenges, invasiveness, and potential for significant cardiovascular complications. Thus, in order to conduct clinical trials there is a need for a safe and efficient in vivo DNA delivery system for liver-targeted gene therapy in humans. Inventors utilized intra-biliary delivery of DNA plasmids via endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP) guided hydrodynamic injection to overcome the current obstacles in liver targeted gene therapy. They divided twelve pigs into 3 groups (n = 4 per group). ERCP was performed by inflating a balloon catheter in the common hepatic duct, then creating a closed space between it and the liver parenchyma. A solution composed of plasmid/sleeping beauty (SB) mix was injected under pressure through the catheter into the closed space. Swine were sacrificed at the three different time points (21, 30, and 60 days) and liver tissue harvested. The trial was void of cardiovascular and local complications in all 12 pigs. The plasmid DNA, both single and combination, was successfully transferred into swine hepatocytes in all 12 pigs as well. In the four swine that were sacrificed at 60 days, successful genomic integration and protein expression was observed in the targeted liver tissue. The ERCP-trial is completed and other applications of ERCP are being contemplated.",

The disease results in the dysregulation and destruction of corneal endothelial cells which are responsible for keeping the eye properly hydrated. As the disease progresses, patients will experience blurred vision eventually culminating in blindness. The damaged corneal endothelial cells do not heal and donor-dependent, transplantation surgery is the only cure for Fuchs\u2019 and other corneal endothelial diseases. Unfortunately, transplanted corneas fail as frequently as 10-20% of time resulting in multiple procedures despite the eye\u2019s status as an immune privileged organ and anti-rejection eye drops. Thus, there is a need for transplantable corneal endothelial cells that do not trigger a host immune response.\n\nJohns Hopkins researchers have discovered a method of generating corneal endothelial cells from a patient\u2019s own blood cells, dramatically limiting the potential for an immune response while extending treatment to patients who can\u2019t find a suitable donor. Blood cells taken from the patient are first transformed into induced pluripotent stem cells and subsequently differentiated into corneal endothelial cells over a 20-day period. These stem cell-derived corneal endothelial cells have the same physical morphology and shape as authentic human corneal endothelial cells. Moreover, mass spectrometry proteomics and gene expression analysis suggest that the lab-grown cells and human derived cells are >90% identical. It is important to note that pluripotency markers are only expressed at basal levels in the stem cell-derived corneal endothelial cells indicating the cells have terminally differentiated and are not potentially oncogenic. Successful implementation of this technology will bring personalized, patient-specific approaches to corneal transplantation and reduce the dependency on donor corneas as well as decreasing the incidence rate of immune rejection.",

    "ip_description": "Prostate cancer is the leading cancer in the U.S. population and the second leading cause of cancer death in men. A promising precision cancer treatment known as photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a way to selectively target prostate cancer cells for destruction. Prostate PDT uses a ligand to attach a light-sensitizing agent known as porphyrin to cells that exhibit prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a biomarker commonly overexpressed in prostate cancer. Laser irradiation of these cells causes highly unstable free radicals to form, which initiates cancer cell death while leaving nearby noncancerous cells unharmed. However, current attempts to target PSMA-expressing cells with PDT have limited efficacy because the ligands responsible for delivering porphyrin either 1) are rapidly excreted from the body, preventing sufficient accumulation in the tumor for treatment, 2) have high production costs and are not scalable, or 3) have poor tissue penetration and cannot distribute evenly throughout the entire tumor. Hence, there is a need for a PSMA-targeting compound that binds to the cancerous cells for a sufficient amount of time to perform PDT, is cost-effective and scalable to produce, and penetrates throughout the tumor. A PSMA-targeting compound known as LC-Pyro was designed to carry porphyrin to prostate cancer cells and remain in tissue for extended periods of time. LC-Pyro comprises of a urea ligand that selectively binds to PSMAs on the surface of tumor cells, a peptide linker to increase the amount of time the compound can be bound to the tissue, and the photosensitizing porphyrin derivative known as Pyropheophorbide-a (Pyro acid). The peptide linker enhances water-solubility of the compound, allowing it to be circulated within the plasma and accumulate in the tumor for up to 8.5 times longer than current alternatives. LC-Pyro\u2019s longer circulation times enable greater imaging flexibility and single-dosage PDT, while alternative small molecule-photosensitizing compounds may require multiple (up to 4) doses. Also, LC-Pyro uses a low molecular weight urea ligand to facilitate better penetration into tumors. Additionally, the Pyro acid molecule enables PET/fluorescence imaging to aid precision treatment planning. The compound is low cost and has a simple and scalable production process, making it a prime candidate for clinical translation. The inventors have developed a method to synthesize LC-Pyro, a new composition of matter. They have conducted in vitro cell culture studies and in vivo animal studies on mice. The results indicated high uptake of LC-Pyro in PSMA-positive tissues, and minimal uptake in PSMA-negative tissues, demonstrating the compound\u2019s high binding selectivity. LC-Pyro also had a plasma circulation time that was 8.5-fold more prolonged compared to an analog that used a single-lysine linker, resulting in high tumor accumulation and delaying tumor growth after a single dose treatment. PET/fluorescence imaging demonstrated a robust fluorescent signal with excellent contrast against surrounding tissues, demonstrating the utility of the compound in imaging applications. Significant cell death and tumor growth inhibition was observed following PDT treatment. There were no observed skin phototoxicity side effects with sunlight exposure.",

    "ip_description": "Kidney stone disease affects up to 1 in 8 people (12%) worldwide and is commonly treated by a procedure known as flexible ureteroscopy (URS). During URS, kidney stones are fragmented and extracted through the ureter. URS involves significant intra-operative decision making since surgeons must accurately assess the size of the stone fragments to make key judgements about when to remove the fragments and if they can safely pass through the patients\u2019 ureter. Urologists typically rely on visual estimation of fragment dimensions via subjective comparison to known landmarks or implements, but this is an unreliable method, especially for surgeons with less experience performing URS. Furthermore, current mono-vision scope systems cannot measure objects in the image because they fail to account for the distance of the target relative to the lens. Misjudging stone fragment size can create complications including discontinuous stone fragmentation, ureteral trauma, or entrapped baskets, contributing to an intra-operative complication rate of 4.2%. The additional time surgeons spend gauging stone size also increases treatment time and decreases surgeon productivity. Thus, there is a need for an accurately measurement instrument of stone dimensions during URS. Moreover, the problem extrapolates to all types of mono-vision scopes including laparoscopes. A wire that is commonly used in USR is passed through the working channel of the ureteroscope as usual, but in addition to its common clinical function is also used to track the distance to the object to be measured. Video capture and wire depth information from the ureteroscope is processed by a novel software, which performs real-time depth calculations and determines the scale of objects during URS. Surgeons can select the boundaries of the stone fragments to view dimensions during extraction. In addition, the dimensional scale is superimposed over the real-time image from the scope. The advantage of the software is that it enables real-time, intra-operative measurement of fragment dimensions whereas current techniques only allow for post-operative measurements. Also, the software can efficiently provide surgeons with accurate quantifications of fragment sizes to within 0.2mm, enabling them to quickly make informed intra-operative decisions instead of relying on subjective estimation. The technology is also easy to integrate with current mono-vision scopes, eliminating the need for hospitals to purchase costly new stereoscopic imaging equipment. The inventors have developed a prototype, software, and calibration process, and conducted clinical studies on patients with ureteral and renal stones. Comparison of the software-obtained dimensions to direct measurements of the extracted stones showed good correlation, with median longitudinal and transversal error of 0.14 mm and 0.09 mm respectively, overall accuracy of 0.18 mm, and precision of 0.16 mm, indicating a high degree of reliability, accuracy, and precision.",

    "ip_description": "Over 1,000,000 cardiac catheterizations are performed annually in the United States. Catheters with a braided surface are most commonly used in vascular intervention because of their superior mechanical properties. While braided catheters made of metal provide the best mechanical manipulation, metallic catheters longer than a quarter of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner\u2019s wavelength heat up considerably when exposed to the radiofrequency field (RF) fields inside an MRI scanner, making them unfit for implantation within the body. This is due to large electric fields induced by the MRI\u2019s RF coils onto long metallic surfaces placed within them. Meanwhile, nonmetallic braided catheters are brittle and mechanically weaker than metallic catheters. Also, RF fields can easily penetrate into the interior of nonmetallic catheters and heat up sensor cables, which transport electrical information from various sensors at the catheter tip along the catheter shaft to signal receivers at the catheter near end. Current catheter designs apply heat mitigation techniques such as transformers and resistors to each cable individually, but the added components take up space within the catheter. Since most catheters have a diameter of less than 3mm, the space restrictions reduce the number of sensors that each catheter can carry. Also, the transformers and resistors may degrade the signal quality within the cables, leading to deterioration of the electrical information traveling up the catheters. Thus, there is a need for a metallic braided catheter design that is MRI-compatible and can protect cables inside the catheter from heating up. Four possible designs of MRI-compatible metallic braided catheters are proposed. The surfaces of these catheters can be constructed from any non-ferromagnetic and preferably minimally paramagnetic metals. Also, unlike existing catheters which utilize brittle nonmetallic materials, the ductility of the metal surfaces in these catheter designs results in improved mechanical properties such as flexibility and ability to resist rotational stress. The braid has added components specifically constructed to trap and dissipate the induced electric fields from the catheter, which reduces the heating of the catheter\u2019s metallic braid in the RF fields, and also shields the catheter interior from RF field penetration, which prevents the interior cables from heating up. This enables these catheters to safely be used during MRI scanning. This is an advantage compared to existing catheters because there is no need to apply individual heat protection components to each cable inside the catheter, which frees up more space. Compared to existing catheters, these designs allow each catheter to carry more sensors and cables and improves the signal quality of the data transmitted through the cables. The inventors have developed four prototypes, ranging in size from 1 to 5 mm in diameter, ranging in length from 1000-1500 mm, and equipped with 9-12 traps over the catheter length. The prototypes carry a variety of sensors on board and were tested in in vivo animal tests in pigs. The results indicate that the designs enable construction of MRI-compatible long metal catheters that are mechanically similar to existing catheter designs and only approximately 20% larger in diameter. Results also show that these catheters can attenuate radiofrequency signals of up to 15 dB per trap for metallic tubular-shaped or braided designs, protecting internal sensor cables from heating up and increasing available internal space for more sensors.",

However, VTEs are often preventable with strategies that stop the development of clots in \u201cat-risk\u201d individuals. Consequently, predicting and preventing thrombotic events in at-risk individuals remains a critical challenge. There are limited prognostic tools that can measure the risk of recurrence in adult and pediatric VTE patients.

    "ip_description": "Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) have become increasingly popular across various industries. From medical to military to entertainment applications, HMD\u2019s market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 37% from 2018-2022 and some expect the HMD market to reach $25B by 2022. Both immersive HMDs, where the user\u2019s physical surroundings are replaced by a virtual environment, and see-through HMDs, where the virtual objects are superimposed on the real environment, require a display calibration to create an accurate environment for the user. The correct pose and proper alignment of the virtual object is critical for the user experience yet current calibration methods for 3D overlaying are outdated. This particularly applies to see-through HMDs. As the market and the use of HMDs increases, it is necessary to develop accurate calibration systems for see-through HMDs; even more so in industries such as military, healthcare or engineering where applications are endless. Researchers from the Johns Hopkins University Whiting School of Engineering have recently developed new systems and methods for the calibration of holographic optical see-through HMDs. Unlike traditional methods, this procedure is aimed to transform virtual objects and represent them on the same coordinate system as the real world. This is the first calibration method for see-through HMDs that factors in the holographic nature of the display. Additionally, whereas traditional calibration methods include tracking the user\u2019s head movement and require line of sight between the HMD and the external tracking system, this is the first calibration method that uses the self-localization and spatial mapping of the HMD in order to avoid head-tracking complications. Overall, this calibration method is not only more accurate but also provides a more efficient and user-friendly experience for the user. System and methods have been fully developed.",

    "ip_description": "A common heart disorder seen in thousands of patients per year is regurgitation, a condition where the heart\u2019s valves do not close sufficiently during systolic contraction, allowing for blood to leak from the ventricle into the atrium. This leakage varies from moderate to severe, and at high levels can put the patient at risk of many other heart disorders such as frailty and pulmonary hypertension. There have been many challenges in the development of a technology to address this issue due to the structural complexity of the heart\u2019s valves, as well as the intricacies of the heart\u2019s contractive mechanism. It is critical to find an effective and noninvasive treatment for regurgitation as an early preventative measure for many other heart diseases. This invention is a set of novel implants and their associated catheter systems that will be able to treat cardiac valve regurgitation disease. This system can be inserted via catheters, providing a minimally invasive method of implant insertion that lowers the cost from a typical open heart surgery. The technology acts as a detachable plug that works in cooperation with the leaflets of the heart valves, improving their coaptation during rhythmic contractions. This method improves on already existing transcatheter systems by offering self-centering capabilities, reducing drag and friction, and allowing for easy replacement if any complications are to arise post-insertion. In addition, the system is patient specific and offers a variety of models to optimize its application.",

JHU researchers found that TSC2 modulates mTORC1 signaling when phosphorylated. They also demonstrated that certain gain- or loss-of-function mutations in TSC2 could be used for the bidirectional control of mTORC1 activity. To control mTORC1 activity, the inventors engineered TSC2 polypeptides that either cannot be phosphorylated or behave as though they are constitutively phosphorylated. The TSC2 polypeptides that cannot be phosphorylated can be used to promote T cell activation, while the TSC2 polypeptides that are constitutively phosphorylated suppress mTORC1-mediated growth. Importantly, these polypeptides did not alter the basal expression of mTORC1, suggesting that this approach can be used for the activation or suppression of T cell responses with limited negative global effects. While these engineered TSC2 polypeptides may be an important off the shelf immunotherapy, they have numerous other potential applications. In particular, using these TSC2 polypeptides to generate engineered immune cells may improve cellular therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T Cells.

    "ip_description": "The global market for medical imaging should grow from $34.1 billion in 2018 to reach about $43.6 billion by 2023. One of the most important aspects of medical imaging is sequential imaging. Currently, most sequential studies have a primary goal of estimating the difference between a prior image and the current measurements of the anatomy, for example predicting the change between a scan from 3 months ago to what the organ may look like today. Sequential studies utilize prior-image-based reconstruction (PBIR) algorithms which usually incorporate the prior image information through a penalty term in the objective function. The standard penalized likelihood (PL) algorithm invokes limitations upon the function, making sure the difference contains the same constraints as the prior image. However, many of the current sequential medical imaging techniques are not very reliable because much of the data received in prior images can be noisy and sparsely sampled. In addition to this, because of the need to update the image sequentially and every few months, the dose of radiation exposure to the patient can be very high. A new method is needed to improve the reliability of the reconstructed difference as well as reduce the dosage of radiation as much as possible. Johns Hopkins inventors introduced a new method called reconstruction of difference (RoD) to reconstruct the difference image directly from the measurements. The method relies on prior image data, but rather than invoking a penalty term, the information is integrated into the data consistency term. The RoD aims to target both a reduction in computation speed as well as reduction in radiation dose through its use with local acquisition. The inventors have tested the performance of RoD under noisy and sparsely sampled projections in local and global acquisition scenarios. The RoD outperformed standard PL in noisy and truncated data as well as in simulation and test-bench data reconstructions. The inventors have created a prototype of the algorithm and are working on further tests.",

MRI imaging is also well-suited for interventional radiology and interventional cardiology, where MRI images are used to track the position of interventional instruments. Many techniques have been proposed in order to track positions of interventional instruments in an MRI scanner. Currently, the fastest tracking has been achieved by placing with miniature magnetic resonance receive coils around the medical instruments. However, during interventional MRI procedures, the cables connected to the receive coils can cause strong radio frequency (RF) induced heating of the medical instruments. In order to prevent overheating of the instruments there is a need for a device that can reduce the heat produced by the coils while still keeping intact the effectiveness of instrument tracking. Johns Hopkins inventors have developed an improved electrically conductive transmission line that is radio frequency (RF) safe. These transmission lines do not include any inductive coupling elements. Instead, multiple coils constructed from twisted pairs of wires are used to block the common mode of the received magnetic resonance signal that can cause heating, while passing the differential mode that is used for tracking and/or imaging. These twisted pair coils are easier to manufacture than the pre-existing inductive coupling element-based transmission lines, and occupy less overall volume inside a medical device. The inventors have created electrically conductive transmission lines with inductive coupling elements, and have demonstrated their operational effectiveness.",

    "ip_description": "The gastric sponge is delivered via an endoscopic procedure through the pyloric valve to the stomach. Upon implantation in the stomach, the gastric sponge will absorb fluids and expand in volume, occupying more space in the gastric cavity and creating the sensation of fullness. This results in a decreased appetite and reduces consumption, inducing weight loss. The sponge is composed of a core foam region made of EAQ series open cell polyurethane that is acid-resistant and non-degradable, and sutured to a flexible silicone outer casing with slits to enable fluid passage into the core foam. The silicone outer casing is highly durable, allowing the gastric sponge to be implemented as a long-term treatment. The casing is attached to a non-degradable tether to facilitate convenient retrieval of the sponge by endoscope. Because the device functions passively, it has lower attrition rates when compared to treatments that require active patient management such as lifestyle modification and medication. Also, depending on the size of the patient\u2019s gastric space, different sizes and numbers of sponges can be deployed, making the device suitable for a broad patient population. Compared to surgical intervention, delivery of a gastric sponge via endoscopy is minimally invasive, so it has a significantly lower risk profile. The inventors have developed a gastric sponge prototype and proposed a process to deliver the device via endoscope. Bench testing results confirm the feasibility of the endoscopic delivery system, and indicate that the sponge is able to withstand an acidic simulated gastric environment and expand in volume by 20% upon fluid absorption. In vivo animal studies were conducted by implanting 20 sponges into a live pig. The pig demonstrated significant weight reduction from 107 lbs to 88 lbs over the course of 2 weeks, indicating the effectiveness of the sponge in inducing weight loss. The study results also showed that the pig\u2019s stomach was healthy with no mucosal erosion or ulcers, confirming the safety and biocompatibility of the device.",

    "ip_description": "This method, non-invasively determining the optimal LAFL ablation sites, uses images obtained through late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI), which is commonly used in clinical settings to quantify the extent of atrial structural remodeling (i.e. atrial fibrosis, lesions, scarring) in patients. Using the LGE-MRI images, 3D personalized computational models are constructed that represent the patient\u2019s unique distribution of atrial structural remodeling. These models allow in silico simulations of LAFL and visualization of electrical propagation as a flow network, which enables the location of the critical isthmus (region of slow-conduction tissue in the reentrant circuit) to be established and pinpoints the optimal ablation sites that will stop LAFL.\n\nCompared to existing invasive methods of locating ablation sites, this non-invasive method is safer and has lower complication rates. In current methods, the operation is semi-blind, so the surgeon may make more ablation lesions than necessary to ensure that the reentrant circuit has been broken, which increases scarring on patients\u2019 cardiac tissue. Instead, this method enables efficient determination of the most critical ablation site(s), relying on a principle known as \u2018minimum cut\u2019 to break the reentrant circuit with the least possible number of ablation lesions. Consequently, this method significantly reduces the scarring and invasiveness of the procedure, pinpoints the sites with much higher accuracy, and improves surgical efficiency.",

VT is defined as an irregular accelerated heart rate due to abnormal electrical signaling in the heart\u2019s lower chambers. Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) can protect high-risk patients from sudden cardiac arrest due to known/sustained VT by administering a controlled electrical shock when they detect a heart is beating much too quickly. As a means to reduce painful and unnecessary ICD shocks, catheter ablation is often a required adjunctive therapy for patients with VT. Despite significant clinical advances in techniques for VT ablation, success rates remain limited and a new technique for ICD patients is in high demand. New technologies have provided a non-invasive technique to identify optimal ablation in VT patients using 3D electrophysiological heart simulation via a reconstructed heart model. However, the approach uses MRI image mapping to model patients\u2019 hearts and thus cannot be applied to people with ICDs as the implant creates an artifact in MRI images. The proposed technology overcomes this issue by estimating the image area affected by the artifact and includes it in the reconstructed 3D ventricular model. In addition, the technology includes a system to compare the predicted ablation sites to the clinical sites when used in a retrospective setting. This new ablation mechanism raises efficacy, shortens the duration of the procedure, and prevents excessive tissue damage during the procedure. The inventors have used this technique to perform both retrospective and prospective human studies.",

    "ip_description": "The formation of vascular anastomosis, the joining of two blood vessels, is a fairly common procedure utilized by many surgeons. All vascular bypass operations and solid organ transplants require anastomoses. However, as the vessels being anastomosed become smaller or less firm, surgeons have exponentially increasing rates of failure. In general, these failures often arise from the technical difficulty of suturing small vessels, as this process requires very precise surgical techniques under magnification. Severed vessels tend to contract and have collapsed ends, making their suturing difficult. There are some devices and strategies available today to facilitate the anastomosis, such as expandable stents and stapling tools, but these devices are generally made of metal, contain vessel-damaging \u201cspikes\u201d, and cannot be removed after surgery. There are also degradable stents, which can be eliminated from the vessel after surgery, but their utility is diminished by the requirement for careful control of temperature, or long dissolution times required for removal. There is a need for a way to aid anastomosis of shorter vessels that is easy to remove after surgery and does not pose a threat to the human body. Inventors have designed a peptide-based hydrogel system, called APC1 Peptide Hydrogel, capable of undergoing multiple consecutive phase transitions enabling its use as a temporary stent during anastomosis procedures. The centerpiece of the hydrogel system is a 20-residue peptide, APC1, which is designed to undergo a phase transition under physiological conditions to form a rigid, self-supporting gel directly in a syringe. This solid-like gel also have shear-thin properties, converting the gel into a viscous gel capable of flow. This property allows the gel to be delivered by the syringe directly to the collapsed vessels, where it re-establishes vessel shape, greatly aiding the suturing of a vessel. The peptide gel allows anastomosis procedures to be performed quickly and easily, representing a promising alternative to currently available non-injectable stents. The inventors have utilized the hydrogel system in multiple animal trials.",

    "ip_number": "C12715",
    "published_date": "10/9/2019",
    "ip_description": "Current clinical imaging methods include conventional X-ray computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Conventional X-ray CT, also known as attenuation-based X-ray CT, has excellent spatial resolution but poor soft tissue contrast, so it is not suited for imaging internal organs. Meanwhile, MRI has good soft tissue contrast but suffers from poor spatial resolution and long scan intervals that result in motion blur. A new form of CT scanning known as Differential Phase Contrast CT (DPC-CT) combines good spatial resolution and soft tissue contrast and can effectively detect small lesions and tumors in internal organs. Unlike the conventional attenuation-based CT, DPC-CT is refraction-based, so it offers enhanced detection of soft tissues. However, DPC-CT experiences poor refraction at the high X-ray energies that are required to penetrate the torso or head, so it requires a large radiation dosage to image organs. Also, conventional DPC-CT uses multiple images per angle, which leads to long exposures and scan time. Moreover, it is difficult and expensive to build a DPC-CT scanner with a large enough field of view (FOV) to cover the width of the human body. Hence, there is a need for a practical and affordable DPC-CT imaging method that is compatible with the high X-ray energies needed to penetrate the torso, has efficient scan times, and delivers better soft tissue contrast and spatial resolution of internal organs than MRI and conventional CT, while using similar or lower radiation dosages. Development of this imaging method can yield potential applications in many fields, including clinical applications like high resolution 3D imaging of internal organs for lesions or plastic medical implants, industrial applications like detecting internal damage in composites used by the aerospace or defense industries, and security applications such as low dose screening against implanted explosive devices or drugs. Current DPC-CT experiences poor refraction at high X-ray energies because the absorption gratings in conventional interferometers cannot be made thicker than ~150 micrometers, which is insufficient to absorb X-rays above ~45 keV. Inclining the gratings at a glancing angle of 15 degrees increases their \u2018effective\u2019 thickness by a factor of 4, which allows the interferometer to absorb more high-energy X-rays, thus increasing refraction. This novel inclined design is named Glancing Angle Interferometer (GAI) and enables enhanced soft tissue contrast and resolution at high-energy X-rays compared to conventional CT and MRI. GAI is used in conjunction with existing techniques including single image phase retrieval, Region-of-Interest (ROI) scanning, and limited angle tomosynthesis CT reconstruction to improve cost-effectiveness and reduce scan time and radiation dosage. The integration of these approaches is referred to as GAI-Tomosynthesis (GAI-TS). Limited angle tomosynthesis reconstruction enables imaging with less scan angles compared to traditional full coverage scans, and single image phase retrieval only uses one picture per scan angle, both of which decrease scan time and reduce radiation exposure. ROI scanning restricts the scan boundaries, which enables precise, high resolution imaging focused on a smaller field of view (FOV) and offers improved image quality when compared to conventional CT and MRI. Because the GAI scanner\u2019s FOV is restricted to only several inches in either direction, it is more practical and less costly to build compared to a traditional full body CT scanner or MRI scanner. Additionally, the smaller FOV results in less radiation exposure, reducing the radiation dosage compared to conventional attenuation-CT. The inventors have developed a prototype of the GAI-TS system and conducted in vitro studies on an anthropomorphic CT phantom with embedded vials containing fresh or preserved organ tissues from humans and animals to optimize radiation dosage and scan time. The preliminary results indicate that high resolution imaging of the internal organs with a scanner having a field of view of a few inches is feasible when combined with an organ radiation dose of several milligrays and a scan time of about 10 seconds. Studies at low X-ray energies with a peak kilovoltage smaller than 90kV show that GAI-TS enables improved 3D imaging of lesions and tumors in human and animal soft tissues.",

    "ip_description": "Piezoelectricity in biopolymers has attracted considerable attention from the scientific community due to biopolymers\u2019 well-defined structure and inducible permanent polarity. Piezoelectric films are used in a number of medical and practical applications, such as ultrasounds and microphones. Current films typically use polyglutamate, a biopolymer that only exhibits piezoelectricity in shear mode (denoted as d14). In other words, the polymer only exhibits a polar charge if the electric field is applied perpendicular to the poling field. In addition, the poling setup required for polyglutamate is cumbersome and expensive, creating a need for an alternate method for polarizing films. This technology is a fabrication process that utilizes a novel biopolymer with high piezoelectric coefficients and thermal stability to make a polar film that can be used in modern day devices. The fabrication process allows production of poled helical biopolymer films that exhibit piezoelectricity in all modes (d33, d31, d14). In addition, the film\u2019s piezoelectric coefficient does not deteriorate when sustained at temperatures higher than 100\u00b0C for more than 24 hours (existing biopolymer films start to lose piezoelectric activity at temperatures above 80\u00b0C). The fabrication process uses electrospinning and hot press, which are simple, scalable, and cost-effective alternatives to the orthodox poling setup. Compared to other biopolymer films, this material is easy and inexpensive to fabricate and exhibits superior thermal stability and polarity. A working prototype has been produced and detailed in published papers.",

    "ip_description": "About 1011 metric tons of chitin are produced annually in the ocean waters, and chitin is one of the most abundant organic substances in nature. It is a polymer composed of Nacetylglueosamine (GlcNAc) and glucosamine (GIcN) residues. These substances are considered to be valuable as supplements in the treatment of connective tissue diseases such as arthritis. The traditional chemical isolation is expensive and is a high energy-consuming chemical procedure presenting ecological problems associated with the disposal of large volumes of waste products. A new method of fermentation that could convert chitin into GlcNAc or GlcN on an industrial scale would facilitate the preparation of medicines and would also provide an alternative bioavailable source of sugars. Additionally, it would be valuable if these sugars could be converted to ethanol. JHU researchers have engineered a Vibrio mutant that can live on chitin-containing waste products such as lobster, crab, shrimp, etc., while being unable to consume GlcNAc and GlcN and its metabolic precursors. Seafood or other chitin containing waste materials can thus be utilized to provide products that can be of commercial interest as supplements (GlcNAc, GlcN) and as sources of biofuels (metabolic precursors). Researchers were able to develop an inexpensive and environmentally friendly method to create GlcNAc, GlcN and biofuel products.",

    "ip_description": "While cancer therapeutics have drastically improved patient outcomes in numerous indications, novel methods to prevent cancer metastasis and recurrence are needed. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a unique subpopulation of a tumor that are more oncogenic and slow-growing than other cancer cells within the tumor. CSCs make up approximately .1-10% of solid tumors and are a major driver of tumor growth and heterogeneity. Importantly, conventional cancer treatments, like chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are often unable to target CSCs, leading to metastasis and tumor recurrence. Consequently, new therapies or regimens that can effectively target CSCs are a promising approach to improve the treatment of solid tumors. This invention describes a method of detecting CSCs within urothelial cancer that can inform treatment. The inventors found a subpopulation of cells within human urothelial carcinoma xenografts that had a higher capacity to form de novo tumors in mice. These CSCs had high surface expression of 67 laminin receptor (67LR), and cytokeratin-17 (CK17). By detecting the presence of cells expressing high levels of 67LR and CK17 in an urothelial sample, tumors with this subpopulation of CSCs can be identified, and treated using an antibody to target 67LR. The inventors have validated this approach using human urothelial carcinoma xenografts.",

The high cost and limited availability of these materials, however, have caused a grand challenge for sustainability. As there is a scarcity of these resources, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of using precious metals or develop substitutes in various applications. Originating from ancient Egypt, plating has long been studied for decoration and modification of metal surfaces. Plating at the nanoscale level, e.g., coating a nonprecious metal nanoparticle with a precious metal shell, is highly desirable for the development of cost-effective nanomaterials for catalytic and other applications. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University have found that when plating cobalt nanoparticles with platinum, the nanoparticles showed increased specific surface area and also exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen.

ESRD patients that receive a kidney transplant have improved outcomes compared to patients that remain on dialysis; however, of the 100,000 dialysis patients on the waitlist for a kidney transplant, only approximately 12,000 patients will receive a kidney, and the typical wait time is 3-4 years. Despite the urgent need for kidneys, about 2,500 kidneys will be discarded from deceased donors each year due to an inability to predict outcomes for these kidneys using current clinical models. There is a need in the field for a clinical strategy to reduce the discard of deceased donor kidneys and to allocate viable kidneys to patients on the waitlist. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have discovered a ratio of urine biomarkers that is highly correlated with transplant outcomes, including donor acute kidney injury, recipient death-censored graft failure (dcGF), and all-cause graft failure. Extrapolated nationally, utilization of this ratio to identify viable kidneys from deceased donors could save over 1000 kidneys each year. The researchers have conducted a multicenter observational study of the outcomes of recipients of deceased donor kidneys. They are also developing point of care test for these biomarkers.",

    "ip_description": "Intraoperative nerve action potential (NAP) is the most common and useful tool for surgeons to guide decisions on surgical approaches during nerve repair surgeries. In a recent trial conducted with 1975 nerves, 57% of the neural elements were completely and perfectly repaired using NAP. Many researchers believe the number of successes would be much higher if the current method of implementing NAP were not so technically challenging due to observed large stimulus artifacts. In order to improve outcomes and reduce artifacts within the procedure, there is a need for a better method to acquire clean NAPs intraoperatively. Researchers recorded NAPs from surgically exposed peripheral nerves in monkeys. To test their assumptions about observed artifacts, they recorded additional responses in a simple model system. They found that large stimulus artifacts obscured NAPs when the nerve segment was lifted up from the surrounding tissue with standard hook electrodes. Artifacts were suppressed and NAPs emerged when \u201cbridge grounding\u201d was applied. Tests in this model system suggested that large stimulus artifacts and the clarity of NAP through \u201cbridge grounding\u201d are related to a loop effect created by lifting the nerve. Thus, clean NAPs were acquired in \u201cnon-lifting\u201d recordings from the monkey peripheral nerves using newly designed electrodes. The researchers also applied their insights to a clinical case in the OR. In a human brachial plexus lesion case, \u201cbridge grounding\u201d efficiently improved intraoperative NAP recordings. The \u201cbridge grounding\u201d method has been tested in animal models as well as clinical practice. It is now being applied to more clinical human trials. The nonlifting nerve recording method using the newly designed electrodes has been tested in animal models and is under translation to clinical development.",

    "ip_description": "The ReduX is a device for controlled vertebral body manipulation. Two ReduX devices are used to manipulate a pair of adjacent vertebral bodies, one on each side (left and right) of the spine. Compared to current surgical procedures which involve the use of many plier-type tools, the ReduX device minimizes the number of tools required by integrating its functionality into a single pair of devices. The device consists of two quick-lock connections linked to screw extensions which allow it to connect to pedicle screws on adjacent vertebrae. The extensions extend upward into hollow poles, which are linked to each other through an X-mechanism. A single ReduX device has 3 degrees of freedom (DoF) between the screws to which it is attached, which is one more degree of freedom than existing state-of-the-art alternatives. When coupled together, two ReduX devices provide 5 DoF of maneuverability, which covers almost a full range of mobility. Full mobility can be achieved by simultaneously using the ReduX device to maintain the position of the unlocked screws while also using traditional instruments to manipulate the vertebrae. Additionally, the ReduX device allows surgeons to laterally translate vertebrae independently from compressing them, which is not offered by any existing instruments. The greater DoF of the ReduX device offers greater mobility and enhances surgeons\u2019 ability to dynamically maneuver the vertebral position compared to alternative instruments. Furthermore, the X-mechanism connecting the two adjacent vertebrae is used to align the screw heads in a parallel configuration during surgery, facilitating the placement of a straight metal frame onto the screws. This eliminates the need to bend and reshape the frame prior to locking it in the screws, which is often the case with classic tools. The ReduX device also includes a novel screw-nut-thread combination connected by two bushings in a single component. This design reduces internal friction, which provides surgeons with enhanced force feedback compared to existing alternatives. The compactness of the ReduX design enables it to take advantage of newly pioneered minimally invasive surgery techniques, unlike classic plier-type instruments that are unsuitable for use in minimally invasive procedures.",

    "ip_description": "Smart materials are designed materials with one or more properties that can be significantly changed by external stimuli. Materials and devices that can change shape are critical to the function of soft robots, programmable matter, and many smart therapeutics. However, current shape change materials cannot be changed without a specific chemical or physical stimulus, and many of these require embedded wires to direct local mechanical deformations. These wires add physical bulk and require batteries or tethering which in turn decrease usability. Thus, there is a need for a simpler and more efficient way to trigger a change in shape change materials. The inventors focused on hydrogels that swell and change shape based on specific DNA sequences. Structural changes within crosslinked DNA can drive either expansion or contraction in aqueous substances and the hybridization of DNA molecules is predictable and sequence-specific. DNA hybridization can also direct shape change of nanostructures, thin films, and colloidal crystals. The inventors postulated that a DNA hybridization cascade where DNA hairpins are inserted into crosslinks through strand displacement would increase the degree of swelling. The inventors tested this theory by designing DNA sequences for the hydrogel cross links and corresponding hairpins for the cascade. They also tested expansion of the hydrogels to a particular, designed final size. A usable hydrogel prototype has been made. It is currently undergoing more testing to be utilized with more applications.",

However, the pathogenic mechanisms of SSc remain unclear and clinical management is limited to non-specific and largely non-efficacious therapy. Consequently, novel disease-modifying therapeutics are needed to improve outcomes for patients with SSc and other fibrotic disorders. JHU researchers have demonstrated that patient-derived SSc fibroblasts overexpress a cytokine, TGF\u03b22, which results in elevated expression of fibrillar collagen, and ultimately fibrosis. Through targeted epigenetic editing, they discovered an epigenetic enhancer that is critical in the upregulation of TGF\u03b22 expression in patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis. The inventors have identified pharmaceutical approaches that are capable of targeting this distal regulatory element to normalize TGF\u03b22 expression and treat Scleroderma-induced fibrosis.

This novel device and described methodology will provide a new therapeutic technique for treating vitreo-retinal diseases, especially when gene therapy and/or cell therapy are involved. To date, subretinal delivery has been widely applied by scientists and clinicians as a more precise and efficient route for ocular therapeutic delivery of drugs, genes and cells including stem cells in many degenerative vitreoretinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration, and Leber\u2019s congenital amaurosis. However, access to the subretinal space currently requires relatively extensive and difficult surgery. The current challenge of directly reaching the subretinal space from outside the eye through opaque structures prevents visualization of the access route, which greatly increases the difficulty and decreases the safety of the procedure. The technology is a method, device, and graphical user interface that altogether allow the surgeon to access the subretinal space via an external approach (through the white coat of the eye, without internal eye surgery) with great precision using optical coherence tomography (OCT). The technology also allows the injection or placement of materials (fluids, gels, solids, cells, other materials) into the subretinal space. The surgeon can use the technology to access the subretinal space and create a subretinal 'bleb', or small blister-like elevation, in order to facilitate the subsequent steps of retinal implantation surgery. The technology also allows the confirmation that the bleb has been created and the materials have been deposited in the correct location. This technology is distinct from the 'conventional' ocular intraoperative OCT designed for use through the pupil and mainly during internal eye surgery in that this device aims to facilitate the creation of an access route to the subretinal space from outside the eye. Johns Hopkins researchers developed a working prototype and generated proof of concept data.

    "ip_description": "This device uses rotary fluid flow to automate the process of loading, sorting, and orienting mosquitoes so as to extract their salivary glands. Unlike current manual approaches, the machine can properly orient and load mosquitos into their respective slots with minimal human intervention, which normalizes mosquito locations to optimize dissection accuracy and efficiency. The device comprises of a large basin with a liquid solution in which mosquitos are suspended. A rotating Archimedes screw then propels the mosquito suspension out of the basin where it then flows down into a funnel. As the mosquitos are channeled through the narrowing funnel, they are aligned into a single-file stream in a head-first or tail-first orientation. Each mosquito will exit the funnel into a slot, where computer vision determines the direction that the mosquito\u2019s head is pointing. Head-front mosquitos are decapitated and their salivary glands forced outwards via a stamp press, then collected in a trough. Head-back mosquitos are allowed to flow back into the basin for re-orientation. The device represents an improvement over existing systems due to its low manufacturing production cost, which will lower vaccine production expenses, and its modular design, which allows its components to easily be replaced. Its fully automated process of loading and orienting the mosquitos improves its speed and throughput compared to current machines, which still rely on manual positioning.",

They have many uses, including contact lenses, wound dressings, tissue regenerative applications, orthopedic applications, drug delivery systems, sanitary napkins, cosmetic implants, and other medical devices. As such, their material properties are highly critical and specific to application. Nonetheless, there is a need for improved hydrogels with customizable and desirable properties, such as high water content, biocompatibility, permeability, tensile strength, thickness, and transparency. Johns Hopkins researchers have created cellulose-based hydrogels which possess desirable qualities, and a method of creating them. This method involves activating cellulose with a solvent, optionally removing the solvent, dissolving the cellulose to form a solution and then allowing it to gel. The method includes an option to dry and rehydrate the gel, allowing for both wet and re-wet hydrogels. These gels can be customized with a large range in a variety of properties including cellulose content, tensile strength, strain to failure, suture retention strength, transparency, Young\u2019s modulus, puncture resistance, tear strength, thickness, transmittance, and water content. The gels can be molded to create contact lenses, corneal in- or on-lays, and medical implants. Several variations of cellulose were used to create the gels, and were subjected to analyses to determine chemical differences, phase differences, and ability to be washed successfully. Crystallinity and cellulose I to II ratios, water content, thickness, tear strength, suturability, and refractive index were also evaluated. Testing demonstrated the versatility and ability to optimize the hydrogels. Mechanical/material property testing has been performed extensively, showing a large range of potential property qualities. Tests have been performed with clinical applications in mind, but have yet to be evaluated in clinical settings.",

As a consequence, there is a pressing need for novel immunotherapies that would allow immune cells to bypass specific inhibitory signals on tumor cells and carry out their primary protective functions. Development of a new method and approach to amplify innate immune responses against cancer and infections would have broad applications in treating human diseases.\n\nB7-DC (PD-L2) belongs to the B7 costimulatory molecular family found on immune cell surfaces (and some solid tumor types) and has a high binding affinity for the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor. Tumor cells expressing PD-L2 can engage and deactivate adaptive immune cells through PD-1 to evade detection and destruction.\n\nJohns Hopkins researchers generated human B7-DC polypeptide variants with altered amino acid sequences which reduced the binding to PD-1, but retained its ability to co-stimulate T cells (i.e., increasing antigen-specific proliferation of T cells, enhancing cytokine production by T cells, stimulating differentiation and effector functions of T cells and/or promoting T cell survival). Such B7-DC variants may allow immune T cells to eliminate tumor cells and effectively stimulate immune responses including those against viral and bacterial infections.\n\nIn vitro and in vivo data is available.",

There is considerable evidence to indicate that miRNAs and their biogenesis protein machinery (e.g., Dicer) are involved in the development of cancer.\n\nTo identify novel miRNAs several approaches have been developed such as cloning, bioinformatics and \u201cin silico\u201d techniques. Direct miRNA cloning strategies have identified numerous miRNAs, however, this approach is laborious and time consuming. Bioinformatic and in silico strategies have recently been used to identify potential miRNAs predicted on the basis of various sequence and structural characteristics, but this technique also has its limitations and requires independent experimental validation. As such, there is a need to identify novel miRNAs and to characterize their regulatory functions for human health and potentially derived therapeutics.\n\nJohns Hopkins researchers created an efficient method to identify novel microRNAs. The experimental approach, \u2018miRNA serial analysis of gene expression\u2019 (miRAGE) was developed and used to perform a large scale analysis of human miRNAs. This method combines aspects of molecular cloning and serial analysis of gene expression. In essence, small RNA species are isolated, ligated to specialized linkers and subsequently sequenced. Sequence analysis of 273,966 small RNAs from human colorectal cells identified 200 known miRNAs, 133 novel miRNA candidates, and 112 previously uncharacterized miRNA* forms.

These costs are expected to rise due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes and other diseases that hinder wound healing. Chronic infections increase morbidity and mortality in affected individuals and reduce quality of life. Consequently, novel therapeutics that accelerate wound healing are needed.\n\nThe inventors have previously demonstrated that combination therapy with two drugs, FK506 and AMD3100, synergistically enhances wound healing in a diabetic mouse model. FK506 contributes to wound healing by activating BMP signaling through its binding and inhibition of FKB12. However, FK506 is a potent immunosuppressant with off target effects. To overcome this limitation, the inventors designed and synthesized a series of FK506 analogs that are not immunosuppressive. Importantly, these inhibitors retained their ability to bind FKB12 and activate BMP signaling. The inventors tested the FK506 analogs in combination with AMD3100 and observed the same acceleration of wound healing that was observed with FK506.\n\nThe inventors synthesized FK506 analogs and confirmed their ability to synergize with AMD3100 to accelerate wound healing in a diabetic mouse model.",

    "published_date": "8/6/2019",
    "ip_description": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1) coordinates cellular processes and regulates recycling pathways in order to control cell growth and metabolic homeostasis. Additionally, in immune cells when the T-cell receptor is activated, the mTORC1 signaling pathway is also engaged and thus plays an important role in T-cell activation, cytokine release, regulation, and memory. Despite its role in maintaining normal physiology and the immune response, mTORC1 signaling can also contribute to various diseases including autoimmune disorders, cancer, and heart failure. In fact, one potential therapeutic target for these disorders is the hyperactivation of mTORC1. However, broadly suppressing mTORC1 signaling can have important consequences for its role in overall homeostatic regulation. Consequently, a more targeted suppression is needed for mTORC1 to serve as a therapeutic target for cancer and other diseases and disorders. The protein tuberin (TSC2), a GTPase-activating protein, is an important, intrinsic regulator of mTORC1 signaling, as its phosphorylation status can activate or suppress mTORC1 activity. At steady state, TSC2 is constitutively inhibitory and gene deletion or loss-of-function mutations drive mTORC1 hyperactivation, causing tumors and neurological disorders. Alteration of the phosphorylation of TSC2 at specific residues could serve as the needed potential therapeutic target for diseases with abnormal mTORC1 activity and could also be used to enhance and alter T-cell responses for cancer immunotherapy. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed various TSC2 polypeptides, a regulator of mTORC1, in which two serine residues that can be phosphorylated are altered to be either gain- or loss-of-function mutations. These mutations serve to either prevent phosphorylation or cause the protein to be constitutively phosphorylated. The researchers have also generated two knock-in mouse models enabling the investigation of how mutating two residues on TSC2 and altering its phosphorylation status impact mTORC1 signaling in vivo and the implications of these changes for potential therapeutic indications in cancer, neurological disorders, or heart disease/failure. The inventors have developed a potentially novel method for modifying mTORC1 signaling as a way to treat diseases and disorders that result from aberrant mTORC1 signaling. In particular, it could be employed as a potential immunotherapy treatment for cancer due to its ability to enhance the role of T-cells. While initial investigation in vitro and also in vivo in mice has been conducted, further investigation is required to optimize the correct mutation(s) needed to alter phosphorylation and signaling for eventual testing and application in human patients.",

The median survival time for metastatic melanoma patients is approximately 8-9 months with a 3-year overall survival rate of less than 15%. As such, there is a compelling need for novel targeted melanoma therapies.\n\nImmunotherapy has shown clinical success in treating cancers that are unresponsive to chemotherapeutic treatments. This requires immune cells to be activated to recognize tumor antigens, after which they can seek out and destroy cancer cells. For T-cell immunotherapy, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) normally activate CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells by presenting a \u2018signal 1\u2019, consisting of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I molecule with an antigen peptide, a co-stimulatory \u2018signal 2\u2019 that directs the action of the T-cells upon recognition of the tumor antigen, and a secreted \u2018signal 3\u2019 for recruitment and differentiation of immune cells.\n\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins University have recently developed a synthetic poly(beta-amino ester) (PBAE)-based nanoparticle gene delivery system.

This AAV vector construct contains the NF1 membrane-targeting GRD (GTPase-activating protein-related domain) fused with an H-Ras C-terminal CAAX motif that suppresses Ras activity.

As prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, early detection is important for adequate treatment. The most common method of detecting prostate cancer remains the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. However, current PSA testing has a well-known limitation, i.e., a low PSA number can miss potential prostate cancers, while a high PSA can lead to false positives in which no prostate cancer is diagnosed. As such, new approaches are needed to further improve prostate cancer test detection, accuracy and reliability. Johns Hopkins researchers recently developed a 4th-generation PSA test, and a method of synthesis, based on the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is expressed in all types of prostate tissue and increased PSMA expression in cancer tissue. Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers are emerging as a versatile platform for drug delivery due to their unique physicochemical properties. Data with PSMA-targeted PAMAM dendrimers (G4-PSMA) nanoparticles demonstrated high accumulation and retention in PSMA-positive tumors in animal models with relatively low uptake in off-target tissues.

Obesity is associated with numerous comorbidities including type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancers. In particular, obesity is commonly seen in the post-menopausal population as 74% of American women over the age of 60 are considered overweight. Post-menopausal women gain an average of 5 pounds with up to 20% gaining 10 pounds or more of weight that is often resistant to diet and exercise. As such, there is a great healthcare need for a treatment to help restore normal weight levels independent of activity and diet. This treatment would increase the quality of life and reduce obesity comorbidities in the post-menopausal population. Johns Hopkins researchers have discovered a method to treat obesity by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 9A (PDE9) activity in post-menopausal women who have reduced estrogen levels due to natural or medical causes. In women, a decline in estrogen levels is associated with depressed nitric oxide (NO) signaling \u2013 an important pathway implicated in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, body weight, and insulin sensitivity. NO efficacy has been shown to be restored with PDE9 inhibition. To this end, investigators challenged female mice that had undergone ovariectomies and had been exposed to a high-fat diet with a selective PDE9 inhibitor. Results showed that, with treatment, body weight declined by 20% due to a decrease in fat and increase in lean mass. In addition to the metabolic effects, the PDE9 inhibitor also significantly reduced cardiac mass (hypertrophy) and improved heart function ameliorating cardiac disease.

    "ip_description": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is regarded as one of the major causes of death and disability in the United States, contributing to 30% of all injury-related deaths. Over 150 people die daily from consequences of a TBI and those that survive often face difficulties and disabilities that can last for the duration of their lives. TBIs range in severity and result from a bump, blow, or jolt to the head that interrupts normal neurological functioning. One common TBI neuropathology is traumatic axonal injury (TAI), which is characterized by impaired axoplasmic transports, axonal swelling, and disconnection. TAI can seriously hinder neurologic function and is often a cause of death in TBI. At present, there are no treatments for TBI and TAI along with other neurodegenerative diseases and it can be difficult to study and model these pathologies in vivo. Consequently, there is a critical unmet need to develop new ways to prevent and treat TAI using in vivo modeling and novel high-resolution neuroanatomical tools in order to improve the outcomes and prognosis for TBIs. Johns Hopkins researchers developed an in vivo mouse model in which they induced TAI in the head of mice and then visualized the brain stem and cervical spinal cord using CLARITY to achieve single axon-resolution. Use of these novel neuroanatomical tools to generate a 3D structure of the corticospinal tract at single-axon resolution allowed for an improved qualitative and quantitative understanding of the neuropathology of TAI, which is thought to be the initiation of a cascade of a series of metabolic events ultimately resulting in axonal degeneration and disconnection. The researchers found that TAI results from dysfunction of the axon destruction protein signal, SARM1. Pharmacologically inhibiting or deleting SARM1 in mice completely prevented TAI and lead to robust axonal protection. The inventors have identified a key regulator and modulator in an axon death pathway that can be manipulated to protect axons from degeneration before they commit to this pathway, which is the hallmark of TAI. Thus, this regulator represents a potentially novel therapeutic target for preventing and treating TAI and TBI. Their novel in vivo modeling and 3D reconstructive system can also be used to identify other new molecular targets for drug development for axonal protection.",

    "ip_description": "The direct medical costs associated with Lyme disease in the United States are estimated at 2.5 billion dollars annually. Precise diagnosis from laboratory results are only most accurate if taken within a few weeks of being infected. The problem is the symptoms are wide varying and come and go. In addition, one test ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test. This test can\u2019t check for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. It can only look for your immune system\u2019s response to it. This test addresses this problem through developing an automated referral of individuals with Lyme disease erythema rash (EM) image. This automated method solves the issue above as it allows for a computer automated algorithm to refer someone with the risk of Lyme disease, based on their skin symptoms that are common, to the correct diagnosis. There is also a need for early diagnosis along with an ability to differentiate and classify different rashes that are Lyme disease compared to those that are not. Early treatment is necessary to prevent long term morbidity from later stages of untreated Lyme disease. The technology disclosed by the inventors has shown that their automated referral algorithm is able to use computerized screening based on the photos patients take with their own cameras. The algorithm is capable of distinguishing and classifying EM rashes when compared to look alike skin lesions that are not actually from Lyme disease. This allows for a prescreening that will triage individuals with a high likelihood of Lyme EM for physician diagnosis and treatment, as early treatment for Lyme disease is key to the survival rates of patients. This solves the problem of later stage diagnosis as it allows for patients to just take pictures of their rash and put it in the algorithm, which accurately tells them if they have Lyme disease and what their next steps for receiving help should be. It allows for a more accurate and efficient prescreening process for physicians. The inventors have currently developed a prototype of the algorithm and are beginning tests.",

This has become a critical issue in light of the worldwide opiate crisis. However, no objective monitor exists to gauge the effectiveness of the medication administered to reduce pain. The current standard of care is to ask the patient whether they feel anything. This is a very subjective approach that cannot be used when the patient cannot communicate such as when the patient is also under general anesthesia, a child, or even non-human (veterinary uses). There is a clear need for a method of objectively determining the effectiveness of regional anesthetics. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel monitor that objectively measures and reports the effect of local anesthetics by detecting changes in the underlying non-stimulated electromyogram (EMG) after administration of local anesthetic. In animal studies, the blockade monitoring system was demonstrated the effectiveness of a regional anesthetic under controlled conditions. Preliminary data in children and adults revealed a clear (statistically significant) clinically important change immediately after administration of local anesthetic in a variety of types of block. Animal and human studies have confirmed the potential of an objective regional anesthetic monitor.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a development of force-dependent drug release system for the enhancement of selective killing and minimization of adverse effects to cancer treatments. Current chemotherapies suffer drawback: normal cells might be and are often inadvertently killed. This is due to the fact that normal cells and cancer cells have similar surface molecules and are expressed on the cell membrane. Chemotherapy toxicity is also an issue because while normal cells stay normal in any environment, cancer cells are able to adapt to the therapeutic environment, causing them to be harder to kill while the normal cells succumb to the new environment. There is a need for a product that is able to kill the cancer cells with the number one priority of protecting normal cells. The problem this technology is trying to solve is this exact issue, in which it is a drug release system that will minimize adverse effects caused by conventional chemotherapy. This technology is a force-dependent drug release system that will minimize the killing of normal cells. It is a 2-step drug release system that will only target cells when simultaneously expressing specific surface molecules recognized to be an immunotoxin. Then it generates large forces that are characteristic of metastatic cells, but not normal cells. The inventors use multiple techniques including traction force microscopy, single-molecule force spectroscopy and microfluidics to verify the forces generated by various cancer cells are significantly higher than normal cells. This serves as the gate keeper to the release of the drug, only when experiencing the high tension that is characteristic of pulling cancerous cells. This is a highly selective methodology. They have designed a molecular glue that conjugates the drug, which contains immunotoxin, to the reservoir. The hold to the drug by the molecular glue can be broken when cancer cells bind to the drug and exert pulling forces. The drug will be released and kill the cancer cells. On the hand, normal cells, though might be able to bind to the drug, but will not be able to ingest the drug and subsequently be affected. This allows the sole destruction of cancer cells while mostly avoiding the killing of normal cells. Currently the inventors are validating their novel technology through rigorous testing in comparing the interactions of their design with cancer and normal cells.",

    "ip_description": "Astroglial dysfunction is associated with the development of numerous central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), and Huntington\u2019s disease (HD). Astroglia are the homeostatic cells of the central nervous system and play key roles in the development and support of neuronal networks. Astroglia have historically been categorized into two subtypes: protoplasmic and fibrous astroglia. However, recent research has demonstrated that astroglial populations are more heterogeneous and that altered function in a subset of astroglia could exacerbate disease pathogenesis. Consequently, the identification of novel therapeutic targets within subsets of astroglia that contribute to disease progression could improve the treatment options for CNS injury. The inventors have identified a critical subset of adult cortical astroglia, called the 8.3-astroglia. This subset represents approximately 28% of all cortical astroglia. The inventors found that the 8.3-astroglia selectively secretes Norrin and LGR6. These inventors found that these two protein pathways are key for function of 8.3-astroglia and are abrogated in ALS rodent models and human ALS. Due to the importance of these pathways in the regulation of cortical neuron dendritic growth and neuronal spine formation, they are a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of numerous CNS diseases, including brain injury, dementia, developmental diseases, neurological diseases, and neuronal injury.",

    "ip_description": "Over 2.9 million newborns die annually within the first 28 days of life, with mortality rates highest in the first 7 days. The majority of these deaths occur in rural areas of developing countries, and are largely due to preventable causes such as sepsis, pneumonia, and hypothermia. Timely identification of symptoms and referral to community health workers (CHWs) can prevent infant deaths. Typically, CHWs in developing regions are responsible for screening and referring ill infants, but the number of CHWs remains insufficient to provide timely post-natal checkups to most newborn infants. Overburdened CHWs may not be able to visit infants during their critical first week of life, so infants with signs of severe illness may not be identified until it is too late to impact survival. Infant mortality most commonly occurs at home, where there is no access to equipment to monitor infants\u2019 vital signs. Reliance on CHWs is not adequate, so the burden of identifying infants\u2019 symptoms lies on other caregivers, particularly the mothers. Attempts to train mothers to recognize signs of infant illness show mixed results as oftentimes warning signs such as \"chest indrawing,\" an indicator of life-threatening pneumonia, are difficult for trained health workers, let alone non-medical professionals, to accurately recognize. Thus, there is a need for a low-cost, easy-to-use monitoring device that notifies mothers of critical signs of illness in their infants and motivates them to seek assistance from CHWs or regional hospitals in a timely manner. Neonatal Monitoring (NeMo) is a two-part system comprised of a physical paper sensor to monitor infants\u2019 respiratory rate and temperature and a smartphone-based application to guide the mother through a clinical assessment of the baby. The paper sensor strip is fastened across the newborn's abdomen with a small belt, and is produced by printing conductive ink through a desktop inkjet printer onto photo paper. The printed sensor functions as a thermometer and a flex sensor to monitor respiratory rate. An audio cable is clipped to the paper sensor and connected to the audio-jack of a smartphone equipped with the NeMo app. The resistive properties of the conductive ink enable the infant\u2019s abdominal flexion to be analyzed by the NeMo app. The app software is simple to use and delivers data about the newborn's temperature and breathing. Mothers are prompted to answer yes-or-no questions that assess seven signs of neonatal illness recognized by the World Health Organization, including danger signs that the child might be displaying, such as convulsions and reduced breast feeding. Positive tests for illness trigger a direct referral to the CHW and instruct mothers to seek medical attention for their infant. By using NeMo, families do not have to rely on CHWs to visit before detecting critical symptoms; instead, the device empowers mothers to promptly seek out medical aid during the critical 7-day period following birth, reducing the risk of undetected illnesses that result in infant mortality. The paper, ink, and wires used in the sensors are low-cost and easily distributed in mass quantities by hospitals, and the NeMo app is compatible with low-cost smartphones that cost $40, making the device highly accessible in rural communities. The current model of this technology is able to detect potential signs of illness as reliably as CHWs, and includes a pre-programmed guide to help families assess danger signs. The inventors have developed a sensor prototype and software to analyze the vital signs, and conducted field testing and usability studies with the prototype in Uganda, Kenya, and Bangladesh. The results indicated that the device can function effectively even when used in conjunction with low cost smartphones. The inventors are exploring the cost savings of printing and including a temperature sensor alongside the existing prototype.",

Insulin production is controlled by the pancreas, specifically by the pancreatic islets, a region of the pancreas that contains the hormone-producing cells. The pancreatic islets are made up of at least 5 different types of cells, including Beta cells which produce insulin. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are characterized by a deficit of Beta cell mass, which is mainly determined by islet number. The pancreatic islets are arranged in density routes throughout the pancreas and research has suggested that islet density may play an important role in diabetes susceptibility. Islet loss is a primary characteristic of type 1 diabetes and impacts type 2 diabetes. As such, islet density could be used as a biomarker for disease progression. A non-invasive method to monitor pancreatic islet density would be a valuable tool for the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of diabetes. Hopkins researchers used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) concentration in pancreatic islets. Using MRS to measure GABA is an established methodology carried out on common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment. MRS analyses will be paired with proprietary software which performs an integrated and automated quality check, resulting in a single value whose clinical relevance will be readily interpretable. Hopkins investigators applied this noninvasive MRS method to characterize pancreatic islet density as a novel diabetic biomarker.",

For the use of PA for antibody binding, the PA needs to mimic the protein\u2019s helical structure, which can be difficult to achieve in peptides. Peptide amphiphiles used for antibody binding can be used in many biomedical applications. The inventors at Johns Hopkins University have developed a method to synthesize PAs with a helical structure and have classified the tuning parameters for the transition between a helical structure and the, more typical, sheet-like structure. The helical structure is crucial for the function of the PAs bioactive epitope, which is used for binding antibodies. It opens the doors for epitopes that could not previously be used, and makes a way for more effective PAs to be used in protein purification, drug delivery, and diagnostics.

    "ip_description": "Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with scleroderma, a type of autoimmune rheumatic disease affecting the skin and connective tissues, have an increased risk of developing cancer relative to the general population. The exact etiology of scleroderma is still unknown. The Scleroderma Foundation estimates about 100,000 to 300,000 people in the U.S. have this disease; most are women between the ages of 30 and 50. Many of these patients coincidentally develop cancers within a few years of their scleroderma diagnosis suggesting a physiological link between the two diseases.\n\nPatients with scleroderma can be subcategorized based on their unique immunological profile. When investigated at this level, Johns Hopkins investigators discovered that some autoimmune antibody profiles were correlated to a surprisingly many-fold lower cancer incidence rate relative to a risk-adjusted general population. Methods to quickly categorize, screen, and treat newly-diagnosed scleroderma patient populations could remarkably improve prognoses as well as have broader implications for immuno-oncology patients with autoimmune diseases.\n\nJohns Hopkins researchers have discovered a panel of autoantibodies present in scleroderma patients that correlate with increased or decreased risk of cancer through epidemiological studies and serologically subtyping relative to age, gender, race and ethnicity matched individuals in the general population.\n\nIn comparative studies of scleroderma patients diagnosed with cancer to those without cancer, sera were analyzed for autoantibodies against centromeres, topoisomerase I, and RNA polymerases I and III (Pol I and Pol III, respectively). A subgroup of patients with anti-Pol III antibodies and no cancer had a novel autoantibody against Pol I. It was further discovered that patients who had anti-centromere and/or anti-RNA Pol I autoantibodies had a drastically reduced incidence of cancer compared to the general population. Altogether, these findings allows physicians to efficiently screen newly diagnosed scleroderma patients for cancer risk as well as suggesting that replacement of protective autoantibodies may be a novel immunotherapy in this patient population.",

    "ip_description": "Over 3 million U.S. patients suffer from severe eye pain and possible blindness due to corneal dystrophies, which can only be cured by corneal transplants. Corneal transplantation can be performed through surgical procedures known as Descemet\u2019s Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSAEK) and Descemet\u2019s Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK). DMEK outperforms DSAEK by almost every post-operative metric, including shorter recovery times and better restoration of visual acuity, but surgeons are hesitant to adopt DMEK because it is a more challenging and risky procedure. The corneal graft tissue used in DMEK is significantly thinner and more delicate than DSAEK tissue, and naturally rolls up into a tube, which makes manipulating the tissue difficult. To avoid damaging the grafts, surgeons cannot directly unroll them and instead must shoot fluid onto the grafts and tap at the surface of the eye. This process of unrolling the graft carries a high risk of damaging the graft and is the most time intensive and inconsistent step of the surgery, taking anywhere from five minutes to two hours. Hence, there is a need for a specialized device for DMEK that aids surgeons in unrolling corneal grafts, improves operation consistency, and reduces the risk of graft damage. Treyetech\u2019s product is a DMEK corneal graft delivery device to be used in conjunction with a newly proposed surgical workflow. In the new workflow, eye bank technicians will first fully separate the graft from a donor eye and prepare it through a novel technique that tri-folds the tissue in the opposite direction to which it naturally scrolls. The device includes a wide-loading platform that allows technicians to easily fold and load the graft into the device\u2019s storage compartment. The device also includes permeable caps to ensure that the grafts remain secure and hydrated during transport from eye banks to hospitals. The innovative tri-fold configuration allows surgeons to simply inject the graft into the eye, where it naturally unfurls. This new surgical workflow shifts the most time-consuming and risky step of graft preparation from surgeons to eye bank technicians, who are more skilled in handling grafts, which standardizes the DMEK procedure and improves operation consistency while also reducing the risk of graft failure. Unlike existing alternatives where surgeons have to squirt fluid or air to position the graft correctly, Treyetech\u2019s device enables the graft to naturally orient itself on the eye. As the only tool that addresses graft unrolling, Treyetech\u2019s device significantly reduces operation time and improves outcome consistency. Also, compared to current devices that are made of components repurposed from other procedures, Treyetech\u2019s device is the first tool that is fully specialized for DMEK procedures. The device includes an ergonomic handle that prevents backflow of fluid during graft insertion, making it more comfortable and intuitive for surgeons to use. Additionally, unlike existing models with round injector tips, Treyetech\u2019s device uses a flattened injector tip to ensure that grafts do not prematurely unfold while loaded and reduces stress on the patient\u2019s eye during the injection step. The inventors have developed a novel device and proposed a new surgical workflow for DMEK. They have conducted in vivo clinical tests and the results indicate that the tri-fold mechanism facilitates graft unrolling and improves operation time consistency. Treyetech is working alongside regulatory specialists to prepare the device for FDA approval via the 510(k) pathway as a Class I reserved device, and are holding discussions with major eye banks for market entry.",

    "ip_description": "There has been a considerable rise in Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) in recent years that allow users to interact with the virtual content presented in the HMD. In order to accurately superimpose the virtual items generated by the HMD to the location in view of the user, the correct pose and proper alignment of the displayed object is crucial. One method of calibration for HMDs involves user confirmation of alignment of a feature on the screen to the corresponding feature in the real world. This calibration process requires several repetitions. Current ways of achieving this calibration method involve hand motions, clicks of a mouse, or voice commands. However, these methods suffer from lack of accuracy and are often quite tedious. Thus, there is need for a faster, more accurate, and sterile way to calibrate HMDs. Johns Hopkins University researchers propose a new general interaction mechanism to calibrate HMDs involving intentional eye blinks. These intentional eye blinks (or other intentional gaze patterns) are especially suitable for \u201cclick\u201d or selection actions to calibrate HMDs. Eye blinks (or other gaze patterns) can be tracked through an eye tracking system incorporated with the HMD system that performs tasks not just limited to calibration. Accuracy is improved by allowing the user to concentrate on the calibration task rather moving his hand or clicking which all introduce distraction and error. In addition, many users, such as physicians, need a sterile environment in the operating room which prohibits them from touching objects or clicking a mouse. Others may have their hands involved in a more critical task working with machinery or doing while using HMDs.

    "ip_description": "Visual prostheses are implanted devices in the back of the eye that are used to restore visual function to individuals suffering from complete blindness or bare light perception. The device works through interaction with the remaining nerve cells in the retina, and to get the signals to the brain it requires a functional optic nerve. A complex issue when first turning on these devices is the implementation of spatial fitting. Spatial fitting means creating a correspondence between the location of what is seen via the prosthesis and its true location in space. If this is not done, people using a visual prosthesis can see objects using the implant, but they have difficulty registering where the object is located. This is critical: If patients have an expensive visual prosthesis that is not properly calibrated, the efficiency of the device is significantly diminished. The present invention is an improved spatial fitting and training system for a visual prosthesis. The system of the present invention maps projected locations of percepts (PLP), where a person perceives a percept from a visual prosthesis, to the intended location of the percepts. The projected location may vary over time. The test results collected under this invention can be used to correct a visual percept by spatially remapping it in the visual prosthesis. While a patient can be initially fitted on the basis of photos showing where the prosthesis is located on the retina, correcting the error the PLPs in a single session and continuing to adjust the change in PLP from time to time provides for a more accurate fit of the patient. A patent application for Spatial Fitting by Percept Location Tracking has been filed including schematics and experimental data with analysis. The data given shows the improvement in mapping by the visual prosthesis using the invention.",

    "ip_description": "Modern cryptographic practices rely heavily on the use of algorithmic and computational security schemes. These systems are frequently slow and because they utilize keys stored in random access memory are functionally costly, requiring large portions of chip area and a continuous power supply; furthermore, these systems are far from perfectly secure. They can be formulaic, cloned or predicted, and compromised. Technological advancements such as quantum computing will facilitate faster methods to compromise standard security protocols and break asymmetric algorithms, further increasing the urgency of finding a more secure method for encryption. Johns Hopkins researchers have potentially found a viable alternative using silicone micro-cavity devices to derive \u201ckeys\u201d from the chaotic nature of guided optical waves. Researchers have been able to manufacture chaotic, functionally random pulse waveforms to create binary sequences capable of performing in challenge/response authentication and suitable for encrypted communications. These sequences are extremely difficult to predict, nearly impossible to clone or compromise and may provide a suitable alternative to standard methods of encryption. The cavities themselves are both functionally and financially inexpensive, created using standard microelectronic fabrication methods and measuring less than 0.01 mm2. Finally this method provides ultra-fast response times under 100 ps, presenting even more difficulty to potential bad actors who would not only need to replicate a near perfectly random sequence, but do so at a lightning fast rate. This technology has the potential to revolutionize modern cryptography, making it far faster, far cheaper, and far more secure.",

    "ip_description": "Lack of force sensing is one of the most formidable technical challenges in retinal microsurgery. Incorporating high sensitivity force sensing into the ophthalmic tools has the potential to provide the surgeon useful force feedback and to enable safe robotic assistance. Forces exerted in retinal microsurgery are generally well below the human sensory threshold. 75% of forces applied during in vitro retinal manipulation in porcine cadaver eyes are less than 7.5 mN, and only 19% of the events at this force level can be felt by the surgeons. Large forces are undesired and can potentially damage the delicate retina. Incorporating force sensing capability into the ophthalmic instrument enables quantitative monitoring of force applied during retinal microsurgery. It can be used to provide awareness of subtactile tool-tissue forces to the surgeon. The technology can also be incorporated into robotic systems to provide haptic feedback and motion guidance. integrate fiber optic sensors into the tool shaft, close to the tool tip, such that the sensors are located inside the eye when the tool is used to manipulate the eye tissue. We developed a family of two degrees of freedom (DOF) force sensing tools that can measure the transverse forces with 0.25 mN resolution. The design provides a sub-millimetric 3-DOF force sensing instrument with integrated FBG sensors. In addition, a new flexure design improves the axial force sensing, and reduces crosstalk noise from the transverse force. Calibration and validation results demonstrate reliable measurement of the contact force as well as location of the sclerotomy.

    "ip_description": "Glucagon and insulin work together to keep blood glucose levels balanced. Glucagon stimulates the liver to secrete glucose while insulin suppresses glucose release. If the body does not regulate glucose levels properly, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) will develop. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a world-wide epidemic, projected to affect 1/3 of people in the U.S. by the year 2050. Many countries spend as much as 10% of their healthcare budget on treating diabetes and its complications. T2DM is characterized by high blood sugar, a relative lack of insulin and insulin resistance, an inability of their liver cells to respond to insulin so that the liver will inappropriately release glucose into the blood. T2DM patients also have dysregulated glucagon secretion. Prolonged activation of glucagon receptors can result in impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). The exact mechanisms behind defective GSIS and defective glucagon secretion are still unclear. Discovering these mechanisms could identify novel treatment targets for type 2 diabetes and help treat an ever-growing disease epidemic. Johns Hopkins researchers found that stimulating liver glucagon receptors produces the neurotransmitter kisspeptin. Kisspeptin circulates to the pancreas and binds to the GPR54 receptor which strongly suppresses pancreatic beta-cell GSIS, impairing glucose homeostasis. Treatment of a diabetic mouse model with a GPR54 receptor antagonist dramatically improved glucose tolerance, identifying a possible novel type 2 diabetes treatment target. Hopkins researchers found glucose intolerant and diabetic mouse models had elevated hepatic Kiss1 expression and kisspeptin serum activity. The kisspeptin receptor GPR54 was detected at high levels in mouse pancreatic islets. Using a specific GPR54 receptor antagonist, researchers ameliorated diabetes mellitus and glucose tolerance in a mouse model of diabetes mellitus.",

Peptide synthesis can be applied to a variety of fields, ranging from cancer research to developing disease therapeutics. Peptide structures, although known at the base to be the combination of amino acids, are extremely complicated in both high level structure and function. A problem in both the research realm in both solely research and therapeutic development, is the creation of different peptide complexes embedded with \u03c0-conjugated oligomeric subunits, allowing for a new vast library of bioelectronics nanomaterials. There is a need to develop soluble self-assembling peptide structures as this would greatly improve the general synthesis of these complicated structures. There is also a need for new peptides to be developed as this would increase both the library of materials to further penetrate different research ideas, it also creates the basis for the discovery of new drugs and therapeutics in different areas. The inventors have proposed a streamlined method for synthesizing peptides that are emed with a variable number of \u03c0-conjugated oligomeric subunits. This use of \u03c0-conjugated oligomeric subunits would allow of unique excitation of electrons creating different reactions that result in different peptide syntheses. They utilize Palladium catalyzed reaction to achieve their goal. By using the power of Pd-mediated cross-coupling, they are able to incorporate several different aryl-aryl linkages embedded within self-assembling peptide architectures. Much of the components being used are available commercially. They chose peptides that were soluble as this has the most applications in addition to various intermolecular reaction that take place with numerous states of the peptide interactions. The solubility issue being solved allows for a greater study of these peptides as they can be manipulated in more environments, further improving their research capability.",

The size of a burn is a major factor in predicting survival and determines the precise volume of intravenous fluids required to resuscitate patients in the immediate time period of burn treatment. The current standard of care uses hand-held charts, Lund-Browder chart, determined by an intricate formula which integrates different body proportions, age and other factors. The clinical observer must accurately sketch the burn area onto a diagram, estimate the percentage of affected body area and perform manual calculations to correlate area burned as a percentage of total body surface area. Another quick triage estimation method is made by the less accurate \u201cWallace rule of nines\u201d. Manual estimations are subject to substantial errors and underestimate the third dimension especially in cases of children and obese victims. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a software application, \u2018Burn Treatment Application\u2019, which is used to assess and provide a treatment plan for burn victims. This tool is delivered via a wireless, hand-held device. The health care provider enters the values of six variables (including age, weight and height) and using a three-dimensional model selects the area of the body which is burned. The healthcare provider simply uses their finger to manipulate the model (rotate, magnify and translate) and to identify burn regions by touching the screen at the appropriate locations. The system automatically calculates the percent surface area that is affected and identifies the appropriate treatment regimen for the critical first two hours of care.

Piezoelectric fibers have proven to be extremely useful in a number of applications due to their ability to convert mechanical vibrations into electrical signals. Numerous modern day devices (microphones, speakers) utilize these piezoelectric fibers as power sources or sensors. The bulk of these fibers are generated through careful crystallization of a series of inorganic compounds. However, this process is very expensive and can result in brittle fibers with poor mechanical reliability, rendering the fibers unusable for wearable technologies. There is a critical need for a new mechanism that creates robust fibers suitable for wearable applications. The technology proposed allows for fabrication of small piezoelectric fibers via a simple electrospinning process. The fibers are composed of PBLG, a synthetic polypeptide possessing the highest electrical dipole moment among all organic molecules known to date. The electrospinning process aligns the fiber molecules in a parallel and unidirectional manner, creating sturdy and durable fibers. This technology improves on already existing mechanisms as the electrospinning process is inexpensive and easily prepared. In addition, it produces highly flexible PBLG fibers that potentially contain other chemicals that will enhance the electromechanical properties targeted for specific applications. Due to their mechanical reliability and robustness, these fibers would be an ideal technology to implement into wearable devices.",

The difficulty with this technology is the introduction of noise, and a low signal to background ratio (SBR). New microscopy techniques have made it possible to get closer to seeing biology at the molecular level in real time, but reducing background and increasing signal while keeping high resolution are still challenges in super-resolution microscopy.\n\nThe new technology developed at Johns Hopkins University is an additional hardware control of the incoming light to use polarized switching in combination with a standard STED laser microscope to remove background noise. Current techniques to remove background noise only partially suppress background noise, are not efficient at removing noise due to periphery fluorescent signal, or don\u2019t work well in both high power STED or low power STED.

    "ip_description": "Exposure of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to ionizing radiation results in a cell-cycle arrest in G1 and G2. The G1 arrest is due to p53-mediated induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1/SDI1, but the basis for the G2 arrest is unknown. Through a quantitative analysis of gene expression patterns in CRC cell lines, we have discovered that 14-3-3 is strongly induced by y irradiation and other DNA-damaging agents. The induction of 14-3-3 is mediated by a p53-responsive element located 1.8 kb upstream of its transcription start site. Exogenous introduction of 14-3-3 into cycling cells results in a G2 arrest. As the fission yeast 14-3-3 homologs rad24 and rad25 mediate similar checkpoint effects, these results document a molecular mechanism for G2/M control that is conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution and regulation in human cells by p53. This invention relates to a protein which mediates cell cycle arrest upon damage to cellular DNA.",

    "ip_description": "MRI has been desired and used for many clinical applications. When obtaining high resolution images, there is a requirement for an adequate signal-to-noise ratio that necessitates a long acquiring time. This makes image acquisition costly and susceptible to many motion artifacts, or noised caused that affects image quality. A common way to solve this problem has been applied to acquire MR images that have both good in-plane resolution and a large slice thickness. The problem with this method is aliasing is introduced in the through-plane direction, causing high frequency artifacts that can\u2019t be removed through conventional methods. There is a need for the successful use of super-resolution, which has the idea to remove aliasing artifacts and improve spatial resolution. Super resolution methods are mostly learning-based and require external training data, which unfortunately due to scanner limitations, is often not available. Therefore, there is a need to overcome this issue to allow for super resolution algorithms to actually be implemented. There is a need for anti-aliasing and super resolution algorithms will allow for high resolution MR images to be taken in a cost effective and efficient manner, and it must be better than current self-super-resolution algorithms. The inventors have proposed an anti-aliasing and self-super resolution algorithm that is self-learning and is able to produce these high resolution MR images without the need for external data. This solves the issue of training the algorithm to acquire these images, as that was one of the main problems hindering this research. The algorithm consists of three steps: 1.) A Self-Anti-Aliasing (SAA) and Self-Super-Resolving (SSR) deep network is created. 2.) This network is created to be able to be applied in several different orientations, allowing for it to take advantage of the fact that high resolution information can be acquired in-plane slices. 3.) Finally, recombining the multiple orientations found in step 2. This SAA+SSR algorithm can be applied to a diverse collection of MR data, all neither modified nor preprocessed. This solution can be applied to many different areas, such as research, diagnosis, and prognosis. By being able to effectively obtain information about the high frequencies visually, researchers and clinicians alike can begin to tackle some of the world\u2019s health problems from a completely new perspective. The inventors have developed a prototype of the algorithm are currently testing and checking the improvement of the algorithm compared to other competing methods.",

    "ip_description": "Tracheostomy is one of the most common procedures for the critically ill and over 100,000 surgeries are conducted every year. Current tracheostomy hand-off systems are inefficient and prevent effective communication within the health care team and with the patient: common barriers are the lack of time, fatigue, and conflict that health care providers often have to face. Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that involves making a small incision in the neck and placing a tube in the patient\u2019s windpipe to allow for air to enter the lungs. Most patients are allowed to return home after the surgery, in which case, they will have to go through the hospital\u2019s tracheostomy hand-off system.\n\nTracheostomy patient hand-offs are especially important as the procedure is multidisciplinary and often requires the patient to learn the maintenance of their trach tube. There is a need to develop a more concise and timely hand-off procedure for new tracheostomy patients being discharged to home.\n\nA researcher from the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing has developed a hand-off system tailored to tracheostomy patients that is concise and effective. This new hand-off system covers all information necessary for tracheostomy patients being discharged to home and allows for multidisciplinary team members to document on the same sheet to ensure the safe discharge of tracheostomy patients. This system also implements a structured interactive element between the patient and the provider; patients have multiple sessions with a specified member of the health care team such that each session addresses different topics such as nutrition, trach care, hand hygiene, etc. This methodical approach ensures that all aspects of patient\u2019s educational component are covered and clarifies the role of each person on the health care team. Whilst streamlining the entire hand-off process for tracheostomy patients, this system also ensures that members of different disciplines understand their specific role and are involved during the hand-off process.",

    "ip_description": "Droplet platforms, which compartmentalize samples into encapsulated droplets for high-throughput analysis, have been used to detect and analyze diverse molecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, and single cells, at a higher sensitivity than traditional methods. Despite advantages in sensitivity and throughput, most existing droplet analysis platforms are only capable of endpoint analysis, limiting detection and analysis of the droplet to a single time point. To enhance the capabilities of single-molecule analyses, there is a need for platforms that allow for real-time analysis for applications such as melting curve analysis, cell growth monitoring, and enzyme kinetics studies. Additionally, current droplet platforms suffer from inefficiencies in droplet capture, which decreases the resolution at which rare molecules and biomarkers can be identified. Researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a real-time droplet platform that enhances the overall throughput of real-time droplet analyses by maximizing imaging footprint, and increasing operational flexibility and droplet capture efficiency. The platform consists of a microfluidic droplet trapping device that has 100% efficiency in the loading of droplets ranging from 100 pL to 1 nL and a thermal-optical platform, which allows for the real-time analyses of up to 30,000 droplets in parallel across a broad range of temperatures. The inventors have demonstrated that the platform is capable of detecting heterogeneous DNA methylation of the tumor suppressor gene CDO1 through digital droplet PCR followed by digital High Resolution Melt (HRM) analysis. The inventors have developed the platform and validated its time-lapse analyses of up to 30,000 droplets in parallel for use in single-molecule genetic and epigenetic profiling applications.",

    "ip_description": "Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) denotes the use of imaging, usually CT scans and X rays, to precisely help target the cancer tissue with radiation therapy. This is specifically done through a flat-panel detector in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for IGRT. Flat panel CBCT imaging quality is degraded by several issues: 1) less than ideal cone based geometry acquisition; 2) inferior signal-to-noise performance to the helical CT detector array; 3) increased scatter noise from the imaging volume; and 4) slow acquisition speed renders artifacts due to patient motion. There is also a need for a system integration solution that can improve operation efficiency, increase accuracy (complexity increases with an accelerator), and minimize motion artifacts which will create a clear and usable image for radiation therapy. To address these operational limitations, Johns Hopkins researchers have developed an integrated CT-treatment couch to support IGRT with an online diagnostic component for x-ray CT. Helical CT is integrated with the treatment couch for couch motion, gantry motion, or both. The CT-couch is designed to support new robotic sensors and controls. The CT-couch can be marketed as a replacement of existing treatment couches. Furthermore, an on-line CT embodiment with additional capabilities can be an available option for this integrated treatment couch. The integrated CT-treatment couch provides a more efficient operation, increased accuracy with helical CT integrated into the treatment couch, and additional on-line diagnostic components to increase its application use.

HCC develops typically in the inflammatory environment of the liver caused by infections or liver disease. Therefore, it is essential to have highly targeted anti-cancer therapies to achieve clinical efficacy. Currently, viral gene therapy used in HCC has poor response, high toxicity, and poor outcomes due to inadequate gene delivery vectors, inadequate delivery methods, immunogenicity, and targeted cell specificity. To overcome the challenges of traditional clinical therapies, improved biodegradable nanoparticles and non-viral nucleic acid therapeutics provide promising treatment through effective delivery of theranostic genes in liver cancer. JHU researchers developed an improved and effective method for delivery of nucleic acid therapy to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells without toxicity and furthering liver failure. JHU researchers used biodegradable nanoparticles as a delivery system selective towards HCC cells over healthy cells. In addition, polymeric nanoparticles, an improved non-viral gene (DNA plasmid) therapy enclosed within the nanoparticles are used to treat HCC. The inventors have preliminary data showing the efficacy of an improved nanoparticle delivery system and nucleic acid therapy for HCC. Inventors have tested a library of distinct biodegradable polymers to show efficient delivery using in vitro (cell lines) and in vivo (mouse models) studies. In regards to gene therapy efficacy, JHU researchers developed a specific non-viral nucleic acid sequence (DNA plasmid) that minimize immunogenicity, cytotoxicity, and increased cell death in vitro on multiple human HCC cell lines. More studies should be conducted on other tumor cell types to prove the efficacy of nanoparticle as a delivery method for gene therapy.",

This has limited efforts to understand X cells\u2019 contribution to disease and to therapeutically deplete X cells, without weakening protective immune responses as well. Consequently, a method to specifically identify autoreactive lymphocytes would improve efforts to develop diagnostics and therapeutics for diseases caused by autoreactive T or B cells. The inventors have identified a unique phenotype of autoreactive lymphocytes. This phenotype is based on the cell surface expression of CD19, CD5, TCR and IgD. The inventors used multi-colored flow cytometry, next generation deep sequencing and binding assays to validate these markers. Importantly, this phenotype can be used to identify autoreactive T or B lymphocytes within a fluid or tissue sample. Once identified, these cells can either be isolated to better understand their effects on autoimmune disease pathogenesis or be used a therapeutic to deplete these cell populations from affected individuals. The inventors have shown the efficacy of these biomarkers at detecting both human and mouse autoreactive lymphocytes.",

    "ip_description": "In the United States, 40% of males and 38% of females will develop cancer in their lifetimes. Additionally, as of 2015, the annual direct medical costs of cancer stood at $80.2 billion. Targeted therapies, such as monoclonal antibody drugs, show great promise in cancer treatment, but these therapies still have many important limitations including acquired resistance, in which tumor cells can circumvent susceptibility to the antibody by mutating the target antigen or utilizing alternative escape pathways. Consequently, novel therapies with superior selectivity, specificity, and robustness against resistance are needed to improve cancer care and patient survival rates. One potential strategy to overcome current limitations is through development of bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) that engage two different target receptors to recruit multiple anti-cancer mechanisms with a single drug. However, high-yield and compact formats for BsAb production are needed to realize the full potential of this strategy. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a new format to express a bivalent, bispecific antibody that combines the previously established knob-in holes strategy and single-chain Fab strategy to produce a more versatile and compact BsAb format that leads to equivalent or superior recombinant protein expression levels compared to monoclonal antibodies. This format has been used to express BsAbs with dual specificity for the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to selectively target the synergistic IL-6/IL-8 pathway that drives the migration of tumorigenic, metastatic cells. The inventors have also used this format to express multispecific antibodies targeting other tumor-associated antigens for a variety of applications in cancer therapy. The bispecific strategy allows for enhanced binding to both cell surface targets, resulting in synergetic suppression of disease, while minimizing off-target effects by favoring interactions with only tumor cells that express both receptors. The bispecific approach also reduces the likelihood of acquired resistance through mutational escape, and addresses important downstream manufacturing concerns by eliminating the need for optimizing dosing ratios, which would be required for mixed-agent therapy. The initial formulations are designed for oncology, but the bispecific approach can be readily extended to a vast scope of other diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, neurodegenerative conditions, and cardiovascular diseases. The inventors have generated BsAbs using their novel bivalent, bispecific format and demonstrated yields equivalent to or greater than those of monoclonal antibodies. In vitro binding studies revealed that bispecific antibodies targeting the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors bind both receptors independently. Moreover, these BsAbs reduced 3D cell migration and inhibited tumor metastasis in mice, even more effectively than monoclonal antibody therapy or antibody/small molecule combination treatments. Further in vivo research on a variety of antibodies that employ this versatile, compact antibody format will be required to advance this technology into clinical studies for a range of biomedical applications.",

    "ip_description": "Unmet Need. In the United States, 40% of males and 38% of females will develop cancer in their lifetimes. Many types of cancers, including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), have devastatingly low five year survival rates, even after the removal of primary tumors. Poor prognoses for these cancer results from metastasis, the spread of cancer from the primary site to a distal site in the body via the circulatory or lymphatic system. Collectively, metastasis is responsible for 90% of all cancer-related deaths. It is often assumed that anti-cancer therapeutics designed to inhibit growth of the primary tumor will also inhibit metastasis, or that interrupting metastasis will not be necessary if primary tumor inhibition is sufficient. Thus, current clinical therapies do not directly address the process of metastasis, and in fact many approved anti-cancer therapies actually induce formation of metastases. Consequently, there is a critical unmet need for novel anti-cancer drugs that efficiently block metastasis to improve patient care and increase survival rates for a range of deadly cancers.\n\nTechnology Overview Johns Hopkins researchers have developed novel bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) that simultaneously bind interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 receptors to selectively target the synergistic IL-6/IL-8 pathway, which drives the migration of tumorigenic, metastatic cells. The bispecific strategy allows for enhanced binding to both the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors through avidity effects, thereby resulting in synergetic suppression of tumor cell metastasis, while also minimizing off-target effects by favoring interactions with tumor cells, which uniquely express both receptors. The bispecific approach also reduces the likelihood of acquired resistance through mutational escape, and addresses important downstream manufacturing concerns by eliminating the need for optimizing dosing ratios, which would be required for mixed-agent therapy. The researchers specifically designed these BsAbs to treat highly aggressive cancers, such as TNBC and PDAC, but they can be applied more broadly to other metastatic cancer types in the future.\n\nStage of Development The inventors have generated BsAbs specific for the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to target a synergistic pathway involved in tumor cell migration and metastasis. In vitro testing has shown that these bispecific antibodies are capable of binding the IL-6 and IL-8 receptor and blocking their interaction with the cytokine. They have also demonstrated the ability of BsAbs to block 3D cell migration and metastasis of mouse TNBC tumors, even more effectively than monoclonal antibody therapy or antibody/small molecule combination treatments. Further research and development is required to test and optimize these bispecific antibodies in animal models of various metastatic cancer to advance this new technology into clinical studies.",

    "ip_description": "White blood cells (WBCs) -- which consist of granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes -- are essential to the body\u2019s immune system. Deficiency in any type of WBC can lead to infection or inflammation, and knowledge of a patient's WBC count is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of conditions, including leucopenia, insufficient WBC, and proliferative disorders (excessive WBC). The Complete Blood Count (CBC) is the most commonly requested blood test by doctors, as it provides the concentrations of various types of cells in a blood sample. Given high resolution images of stained WBCs, they can be differentiated by their differences in size and nuclear shape, and traditional methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or Dictionary Learning based methods can be successfully used to classify WBCs. However, traditional image-based classification methods do not perform well when dealing with low resolution images of unstained WBCs. There is therefore a need for a novel method that is able to accurately count and classify unstained WBCs in the low resolution setting, as such a method is key to developing new technology to perform a low-cost CBC. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a method for classifying WBCs from images of lysed blood from both normal and abnormal blood donors (lysed blood contains WBCs, in addition to debris from lysed RBCs). Using a generative model that was trained using both purified WBC images and CBC results from more than 300,000 patients at the Johns Hopkins hospitals, the method can differentiate WBCs into granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes, as well as count the total number of WBCs in the image. This technology enables counting and differentiation of WBCs, even in low resolution images of unstained WBCs. This method has the potential to enable new, low-cost and rapid CBC technology. The invention has been tested with 36 lysed blood samples from both normal and abnormal donors. The strongest correlation between the predicted and ground truth cell concentrations appeared for granulocytes and lymphocytes. The monocyte correlation was not as strong, however the absolute errors between the predicted and ground truth monocyte concentrations were small.",

The advantage of printed electronics over the traditional methods is that the former are much simpler and cost-effective. The ability to integrate new or improved functionalities also adds to the advantage of printed electronics. An issue with printed electronics is high leakage currents which override the switching action of the gate of a transistor when high-capacitance gate dielectrics are used. Currently, thick dielectric gates with low capacitance are used because they have minimal leakage currents, but to use these gates, much higher voltages (10-100V) must be used which is unsustainable in situations where power is limited such as with small batteries or radiofrequency power sources. There is a lack of a method that allows for high capacitance gates to be used, to save power, while lowering the leakage current, and to not override the transistor. The proposed technology uses a sol-gel processed ion conductor as a gate. The combination of sol-gel processed gate dielectrics and electron-accruing semiconductors operate at a range of 0.1-10V which is much lower than the alternative with thick dielectric gates. This technology uses n-channel transistors instead of the traditionally used p-channel resistors. Another advantage of this technology is that the procedures used to create it are not high-tech deposition methods such as organometallic chemical vapor deposition or atomic layer deposition.

Tests showed that the voltage required for this technology was between 0.1 and 10 volts which is much lower than the currently used voltages which are between 10 and 100 volts.",

The effect of angiotensin receptor blockers in a wounded subject can be harmful during the early stages of wound healing; however, use of angiotensin receptor blockers during the later proliferative and remodeling stages of wound healing can significantly enhance wound healing rate and improve scar quality. This narrow margin between harm and benefit as well as need for frequent drug administration are major obstacles impeding the therapeutic use of angiotensin receptor blockers in wound healing. Advantages of the invention described herein include: Self-assembling hydrogels maintain moist environment needed for wound healing, Biocompatibility and non-adherent nature reduces discomfort, Greatly simplified and extended usage due to healing and anti-inflammatory properties. Technical Background: Johns Hopkins researchers have developed novel amphiphilic compounds that self-assemble into a hydrogel composition useful for treating wounds, including chronic wounds and diabetic wounds. The compounds of the invention have structural characteristics, such as hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties, that enable self-assembly into discrete nanostructures, which then entangle to form the hydrogel. The hydrogel comprises a plurality of compounds that contain a therapeutic agent moiety and hydrophobic and hydrophilic elements that give structure to the composition. Exemplary amphiphiles enriched with valsartan significantly enhanced would healing in wound closure studies in vivo.",

Population ageing is accompanied by rising numbers of elderly people requiring intensive health care. Therefore, the here-presented 8-item screening questionnaire Pra (Probability of Repeated Admission), enabling the calculation of a Pra risk score describing a persons risk to require health care services in the future, and its extended version PraPlus, containing additional 9 questions gathering additional health-related information, present a valuable tool to assure an early-stage crisis prognosis and personalized health care. Advantages of this invention include: \u2022 Early-stage risk evaluation and crisis reduction \u2022 Short questionnaire allows fast completion and convenient and flexible admission by either mail or telephone. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed the questionnaires Pra and PraPlus to determine the probability of elders to necessitate health care services in the future and evaluate their specific needs, permitting an early-stage crisis intervention and individualized health management. As people live longer, the increasing frequencies of elderly people suffering from chronic medical conditions raise the demand for novel methods for early crisis intervention and customized health care. Hence, the 8-item questionnaire Pra, addressing the persons physical and mental health status, forms the basis for the calculation of a Pra risk score, allowing a prognosis of the persons future medical condition and utilization of health care. Next, PraPlus in additional 9 questions inquires about functional status, sensory impairment, nutrition, depression, living situation, and major medical diagnosis. Taking into account the time-saving and convenient administration per mail or phone, this survey provides an important tool to enable clinicians or health care organizations to generate tailored care plans. Together, this technology permits the prevention or reduction of crises that might otherwise lead to hospitalization or institutionalization, therefore significantly reducing long-term medical procedures and costs.",

NEC is thought to be caused by defective bacterial-host signaling during colonization of the intestine with bacteria, leading to an exaggerated inflammatory response. Currently, there is no specific cure for NEC, and surgical resection of the damaged tissue is often required. The overall survival for patients (70-80%) has not changed significantly in the past 30 years. Johns Hopkins researchers have identified novel agents that reduce NEC. By stimulating enteric glial cells, these compounds are able to inhibit Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4 signaling) in the intestinal epithelium. TLR4 in turn plays a role in the pathogenesis of NEC.

    "ip_description": "Early cancer detection leads to increased survival rates in patients. However, current biomarker assays to detect circulating tumor DNA and proteins lack the sensitivity needed to detect the earliest stages of cancer development. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel assay to detect circulating cancer proteins in the femtomolar range (fM, 10-15 M), a sensitivity that can detect the earliest stages of cancer development. The assay, Single-Molecule Analysis by Shape (SMASH), utilizes microfluidic chip technology to non-invasively detect mutant proteins specific to cancer cells in fluid samples with greater specificity and sensitivity than current methods. Precise detection of cancer proteins at fM concentrations occurs after fluid samples are applied to the microfluidic chip capture surface, bound by customizable capture antibodies, and spatially resolved using time-stream total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy. SMASH has been validated using peripheral blood samples from cancer patients and healthy donors to detect mutant p53 or its autoantibodies in close to 90% of ovarian cancer patients but not in any healthy subjects. SMASH can be customized to detect individual proteins or multiplexed in order to detect combinations of cancer protein biomarkers in patient fluid samples. Broad analysis of single-molecule imaging to characterize disease-associated proteins in the blood. High sensitivity allows use to detect, diagnose, and/or study disease at the earliest stages.

    "ip_description": "Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of death among gynecological cancers and is associated with poor outcomes and low overall survival rates. The current standard of care involves surgical resection of the solid tumor, followed by chemotherapy. This type of therapy has limited success among women with advanced disease, and often results in recurrence. Advances in new ovarian cancer therapies have been limited due largely to a lack of understanding of the molecular characteristics of the disease. As such, there is a need for a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying epigenetics of ovarian cancer in order to facilitate the development of new, more effective therapeutic treatments. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel approach called, Trellis, for detecting and characterizing tumor-specific sequences and structural alterations in ovarian cancer by performing genome-wide sequencing analysis. Integrating these techniques with methylation and gene expression analyses has allowed for identification of molecular and genetic alterations associated with ovarian cancer. These studies identified alterations not previously implicated in ovarian cancer, such as the amplification, underexpression, deletion, and rearrangements of several specific genes and pathways. Researchers further evaluated the effects of targeted agents on identified pathways using dose-response models. Such studies showed that ovarian tumors with PIK3CA and PPP2R1A alterations, which are common in ovarian clear cell cancers, showed enhanced sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors, suggesting that these inhibitors may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Evaluation of MYC amplification revealed that MYC plays a central role in multiple ovarian cancer cell lines and causes increased sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for this subset of ovarian cancers. These models may reveal new and effective treatment methods for ovarian cancer. Hopkins investigators have successfully identified molecular alterations associated with ovarian cancer, and further predicted and evaluated their susceptibility to targeted therapies. These studies reveal potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Presently, all studies have been performed in vitro, and have evaluated only genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic changes. Future studies will also target proteomic, metabolomics, and carbohydrate changes to further characterize the condition. Additionally, in vivo studies will be needed to demonstrate the potential for clinical translation of these observations.",

    "ip_description": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes the majority of cases of cervical cancer, which affects approximately 500,000 women worldwide each year. Additionally, HPV has been associated with other cancers including penile, vaginal, vulvar, anal, and head and neck cancers. Currently, there are limited treatment options for patients with advanced cervical cancer. Therapies that boost the immune response to cancer-specific antigens are a promising approach to treat advanced cancers. Since HPV oncoproteins, like E7, are drivers of carcinogenesis and are constitutively expressed by cancer cells, they are a promising molecular target for the treatment of cancer. However, novel strategies to effectively deliver HPV antigens into the tumor microenvironment in an immunogenic manner are needed for this approach to be effective. Johns Hopkins researchers have generated a fusion protein between HPV E7 oncoprotein and Annexin V. This fusion protein, called AnnE7, was tested in a cancer mouse model that expresses HPV protein. Annexin V targets the HPV E7 protein to platelets, which act as antigen presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment. This strategy is particularly promising to treat advanced cervical cancer, because elevated platelet counts are associated with a poor prognosis in cervical cancer and other cancer indications. In vivo, AnnE7 effectively accumulated in the tumor microenvironment and generated a potent tumor-infiltrating E7-specific CD8+ T cell response. This immune response suppressed tumor growth in vivo and enhanced mouse survival rates. The inventors have performed preclinical research that demonstrates the efficacy of their invention in a mouse model of carcinoma that expresses HPV proteins.",

    "ip_description": "During computed tomography (CT) or cone-beam CT, scans can be affected due to patient motion that causes significant artifacts that diminish image quality. This is functionally the case because of slow image acquisition speed, causing artifacts in the image due to patient\u2019s difficulty in following commands and remaining still. Furthermore, motion patterns occurring in brain imaging are even more challenging due to more rapid, aperiodic, and of larger amplitude. Currently, there is an \u201cauto-focus\u201d motion compensation method where the patient motion is iteratively estimated so the image is reconstructed to its maximum capability. However, there is a problem when encountering a critical care imaging offers even larger amplitude and rapid displacement, which challenges this autofocus optimization method. In addition, there is a need to optimize and improve reconstruction methods so that they are able to consider multiple fields of views. This allows for movement to not be as destructive to image quality. The inventors have proposed a new autofocus method, called \u201cMulti-Motion,\u201d that accounts for multiple regions and objects undergoing different motion patterns. This means it can take into account a patient\u2019s head rolling within a head cradle or even a lower part of the leg moving separate speeds than the upper portion of the leg. This methodology uses novel-preconditioning to begin motion estimates, improving the efficiency of the Multi-Motion algorithm. This novel innovation doesn\u2019t require the motion-free 3D image as an input for 3D-2D registration as the current method does. By using an uncompensated 3D image reconstruction that actually generates 2 or more sub-regions, this method can model complex deformable motion. This algorithm doesn\u2019t require any trackers, fiducials, or prior scans for estimation. The novel two-pronged methodology of including a preconditioning stage and modifying reconstruction methods to accommodate multiple fields of motion not only improves on the accuracy but also the efficiency of prior art. The inventors have proposed a novel Multi-Motion algorithm to significantly reduce the effects of patient motion on CT scans. They have evaluated their algorithm through experimentation, and they plan to move from ongoing application to collecting clinical data of a prototype CBCT scanner.",

One example of its global importance is that more than 53 million units of blood are screened worldwide for presence of pathogens using NAAT. However, NAAT testing remains expensive and is not readily available at point-of-care sites for at-risk populations who are susceptible to many infectious diseases. As such, there is a need for new approaches that can expand the \u201cone target per test\u201d limitation of current NAAT assays. Johns Hopkins researchers recently developed a multiple-target detection approach termed, Ratiometric Fluorescence Coding (RFC), in which a nucleic acid target can be probed by a unique relative ratio of two or more color fluorophores. This fluorescent color ratio technique facilitates a high-degree of multiplexing (e.g., >40-plex using only 3 fluorophores with distinct colors) and can be implemented in a variety of assays and readout formats, e.g., standard plate reader, microfluidic digital detection and single-molecule detection modalities. RFC is capable of simultaneously detecting DNA targets from six infectious diseases using only 2 color probes, with the possibility of additional color-labeled probes to expand its multiplexing potential. With further development, Ratiometric Fluorescence Coding has the potential to increase the number of nucleic acid targets via highly multiplexed fluorescent probes into one single assay facilitating molecular pathogen identification and diagnosis of diseases.",

Many \u2018smart\u2019 materials and devices feature a stimulus-responsive architecture that allows for the shrinking or swelling of designated regions under controlled conditions. These mechanical deformations are often achieved by embedding wires into the material; however, wires are physically bulky and require tethers or batteries to properly operate thus limiting the scope of their usage. Furthermore, it is difficult to incorporate wires into hydrogels and other soft devices that are very small and have complex shapes. In a rapidly growing smart materials market, there is a need for versatile methods for programming inducible shape change capabilities into hydrogels and ever-shrinking devices. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel DNA-hydrogel material that is able to expand or contract in response to environmental changes. The inventors used photolithography to build polyacrylamide machines coupled to DNA. These machines can be built in any number of different shapes and sizes. Depending on the chemical environmental stimuli, the DNA-hydrogel can specifically expand or contract in a programmable concurrent or stepwise manner. This method presents advantages in terms of autonomy, versatility, programmability, device integration, and miniaturization as compared to materials with embedded wires. As such, this technology has the potential to dramatically improve the capability of modern smart devices/actuators to sense and mechanically respond to various stimuli.

Undesired events such as revision surgery, failed back surgery, and recurrent lumbar disc herniation are becoming increasingly common. The relationships between patient risk factors and outcomes are complex and poorly understood. Thus, determining the extent that a patient will benefit from surgery and recommending therapeutic options is a challenging and subjective task for spine surgeons operating within the current standard of care. Existing predictive models provide decision support using patient demographic information, not information from radiographic images. To the extent that image information is included, it is often manually determined and qualitative in nature. Tools that automatically analyze perioperative images and incorporate them into predictive models could drastically improve the performance of current models that only use patient demographic information. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a framework to help support surgical decisions and predict spine surgery outcomes. This method extracts quantitative anatomical and morphological features of the patients\u2019 spine from perioperative images and incorporates this information into current models that use patient demographics. This framework uses automatic image processing and machine learning algorithms to identify features that determine patient outcomes. These data can be used preoperatively to identify if the patient will benefit from surgery, and, if so, help select the optimal surgical approach. It can also be used post-operatively to provide prognostic information and guide rehabilitation. This new framework provides decision support to the surgeon and patient regarding various choices in treatment based on statistical analysis of patients who previously underwent surgery, whereas the current standard-of-care relies on subjective experience of the surgeon.",

Presently, one of the most commonly used site-specific, genome editing systems is CRISPR/Cas9, as it enables insertion and deletion of specific gene fragments both in vivo and in vitro. However, CRISP/Cas9 along with other genome editing technologies only allow for editing on a per-gene basis and must be laboriously repeated for each gene of interest in a given system, limiting the throughput of the assay. Consequently, a protocol that allows for more efficient, multiplexing of template-based genome editing to target multiple genes at one time in a high-throughput manner is greatly needed. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a set of scalable protocols that enable simultaneous generation of multiple edited cell lines in a high-throughput manner. The protocols have three main components. The first includes generating a library encoding sequences specific to the targeted genomic sites and in association with their corresponding DNA repair templates that carry the desired edits. The library design comprises constant elements consisting of needed machinery and variable parts with the gene/locus specific guide RNAs. The second element includes packaging and delivering the library with viral vectors expressing the needed genome editing components. Finally, the protocols include a specific methodology for isolating and conducting quality control of clonal lines that contain the desired transgenes.

    "ip_description": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular, rapid heart rate in which the two upper chambers (atria) of the heart beat chaotically and out of sync with the lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. Ultimately, this condition can increase one\u2019s risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular complications. AF is thus regarded as an important healthcare problem as it results in more than 750,000 hospitalizations and 130,000 deaths each year in the United States, generating $6 billion in healthcare costs. It is estimated that 2.7-6.1 million people in the United States are currently living with AF. One procedure used to treat AF in patients that have fibrosis in the atria is catheter ablation in which the pulmonary veins are isolated with catheter ablation lesions. However, 20-40% of patients often experience recurrent AF following the first ablation procedure and must undergo a repeat procedure, which presents additional complications and considerations. Consequently, there is an unmet need for a method that can predict the likelihood of recurrence following ablation and pulmonary vein isolation in patients and can aid in the suggestion of strategic, individualized approaches for more successful index AF ablation surgeries. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel approach that can be used to predict AF recurrence after ablation surgery and pulmonary vein isolation. This approach constructs an individualized, patient-specific model of the patient\u2019s atria using a contrast-enhanced MRI along with stimulations to characterize the types of arrhythmia that could possibly occur. The results from the stimulations and MRI are then fed into a machine learning algorithm to determine the set of features that is the most predictive of AF recurrence following the ablation procedure. The algorithm will have the ability to predict with relatively high accuracy, whether isolating the pulmonary vein will successfully eliminate the patient\u2019s AF or if the physician must perform additional ablation in the fibrotic parts of the atria. The inventors have developed a novel method and machine learning algorithm to predict the outcomes and best methodology to be used in ablation procedures for patients with AF in order to minimize complications and prevent recurrence. At present, additional research and development is required to optimize and train the algorithm for widespread use in patients with AF.",

Based on two popular theoretical approaches, Orem's self-care model and Motivational Interviewing, this instrument has three distinctive scales (20 items each) to assess HBP self-care behavior, motivation, and self-efficacy. The items in each scale was written at the sixth-grade reading level. These scales can be used together or independently. The inventors tested HBP SCP on 213 English-speaking inner-city residents with HBP (mean age, 68.6 years; 76.1% women; 81.7% African American). Rigorous psychometric testing supports that the HBP SCP is reliable, valid, and significantly correlated with theoretically selected variables. The HBP SCP\u2013Behavior scale also successfully discriminated between those with or without blood pressure control.",

    "ip_description": "Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy. Additionally, it is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths among men in the United States with nearly 1 in every 6 men predicted to be diagnosed with the disease at some point in their lives. Currently, the most common biopsy method is a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided from a core needle biopsy. Ultrasound rarely identifies prostate cancer visually, which causes the use of freehand biopsy for diagnosis to be used more often. However, freehand biopsy is highly inconsistent, subjective, and causes uneven sampling that leaves large regions of the prostate to go unsampled. There is a need for an improved methodology that removes the use of freehand to diagnosis prostate cancer. Furthermore, this method needs to be cost effective and easily implementable in current operating room workflow. There is a movement towards the use of multiparametric MRI as a targeted biopsy approach. This is preferred as it allows the biopsy needle to be guided to sample areas that have suspicions for being cancerous, rather than freehand. The inventors have developed a robot-assisted approach for transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. This hands-free TRUS operation causing minimal prostate deformation is significantly safer, easier, and is feasible for operating room performance. The use of accurate needle targeting against cancerous regions removes the subjectivity and inconsistency found in freehand and automates a process that has plagued the biopsy process with under-sampling of clinically significant cancer and under-staging of diagnosis. The inventors have developed a prototype and have performed comprehensive tests in a clinical setting.",

Furthermore, it costs a fraction of what a benchtop multi-contrast imaging system costs, and has a miniature footprint that is ideal for preclinical studies. This technology is based on recent advances in miniaturized opto-electronics and 3D printing techniques. The microscope is 5 cm3 and weighs less than 9 grams. The weight is further reduced to 3 grams via a flexible strain relief system. This microscope captures images of neural activity by incorporating a fluorescence channel in addition to three different channels for hemodynamic imaging. The inventors have demonstrated five major applications of this ultraportable device. The first is utilizing the technology to distinguish between neuronal activation and concomitant changes in blood flow and blood volume. The second is to differentiate between blood vessel compliance and blood flow dynamics during arousal from anesthesia. The third is using a synchronization channel built into the microscope to conduct simultaneous neuroimaging and EEG recording. The fourth is enabling multi-contrast functional brain imaging and wide-area mapping analogous to functional MRI studies. The fifth is interrogating brain cancer-induced alterations in the cerebrovasculature over the lifetime of the pathology. Additional applications envisioned include the study of stroke, immune modulation in the brain, high-throughput drug testing, infectious disease research, BSL4-type rodent studies, neurodegenerative disorders, CRISPR edited transgenic mouse phenotyping, and correlations of functional imaging with behavioral assays.",

In addition, liver and ovarian cancer cells have been shown to produce increased amounts of H2S. However the role of H2S and mechanism of action in these bodily functions is unclear to date. Recently, it has been reported that some of the activity that has been attributed to H2S may be attributed to hypersulfides (RSSH) or polysulfides (RSnR). Classical methods of producing hypersulfides are done in non-physiological conditions. In order to study the role of hypersulfides in these bodily functions, the hypersulfides must be producible in situ and the rate of release of the active hypersulfide must be controllable under physiological conditions. Furthermore, any RSSH prodrugs developed would require the same parameters, in addition to being bench stable for some period of time. Johns Hopkins researchers have created a class of chemical compounds (S-Substituted Thioisothioureas) that are precursors to hypersulfides that can will release RSSH under physiological conditions. These researchers have shown that hypersulfides with a variety of functional groups can be produced in situ using this chemistry. With the ability to produce these compounds in situ in a physiological environment, research can be done to determine the role that RSSH has in bodily functions, and possible therapeutic and/or drug targets may be designed for many of the ailments listed above which utilize the S-substituted thioisothiourea functional group. Additionally, these precursors are bench stable as a solid for several months. The researchers thus far have shown that RSSH can be released reliably and controllably with a variety of substituent \u201cR\u201d groups. Further development of this class of compounds and evaluation of their biological properties is ongoing.",

However, these applications require precise control over the chemical process responsible for storing, accessing and deleting data. Since the rate of a chemical process is usually dependent on the concentration of the reactants, the ability to control the concentration of \u201cactive\u201d DNA strands may be useful for these applications. A common technique to control the concentration of something in solution is to use a buffer system. The most common buffer systems control pH in solution, as these are found both naturally in the human body and artificially in laboratories. While some buffers exist for other species such as metal ions, buffer systems for small molecules are sparse, with synthetic DNA buffer systems being non-existent. The development of a DNA buffer system could be an important puzzle piece in the design of DNA based computing/data storage. Additionally, a DNA buffer system could allow for controlled DNA based drug delivery. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed an oligonucleotide buffer which is capable of maintaining a constant concentration of a desired oligonucleotide sequence. These buffers operate similar in principal to a pH buffer, in that they are designed to regulate the concentration of an oligonucleotide in solution and re-establish this desired concentration when perturbations occur. The researchers have shown the buffer system has a wide ranging flexibility in its design. The researchers can design their buffer system to work with different oligonucleotide sequences. Also, different target concentrations of the desired nucleotide sequence can be achieved by changing the concentration of source and initiator used. The rate at which the buffer system can respond and re-establish the buffer concentration.",

    "ip_description": "Assessing kidney function is often essential for clinical decision making for a variety of diseases including chronic kidney disorder (CKD). CKD affects more than 30 million Americans and millions of others are at an increased risk of developing it. The gold standard for measuring renal function for diagnosing/monitoring CKD and other disorders involving renal dysfunction is calculating glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR can be measured in multiple ways, but each presents important limitations. For example, GFR can be estimated via insulin clearance rate but this is time-consuming and costly. It can also be estimated by measuring blood clearance, but this method cannot measure split renal function or provide any structural imaging of the kidneys. Filtered single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) and 99mTc-mercaptuacetyltriglycine (99mTc-MAG3) may also be used for 3-dimensional renal imaging and anatomical co-registration, but it requires a prolonged acquisition and low single pass extraction, which presents a major obstacle for reliable imaging. Consequently, there is a critical need for an imaging method and tracers that can provide rapid 3-dimensional imaging of the kidneys for assessing renal structure and function. Johns Hopkins researchers have radiolabeled a B-Complex vitamin substance that was previously shown to exhibit rapid renal excretion, with positron emitting radionuclides for use in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the kidneys. Good radiochemical yield of the substance was obtained along with high specific activity and high chemical and radiochemical purity. The radiolabeling of this vitamin substance enables it to serve as a marker for renal function and anatomy when used in PET for obtaining high quality, dynamic images of one or both of the kidneys with limited radiation exposure. Renal excretion in rats has been characterized successfully with this novel imaging tracer using PET. The inventors have generated a novel marker of renal function and anatomy that can be used for PET imaging of the kidneys. It has been used in vivo in rats with success but further research is still required to test the efficacy of this agent during PET imaging in human patients.",

There is no cure for arthritis, and in the end stages of the disease, joint replacement is often needed. Current approaches to treat arthritis aim to control pain via the use of analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, current approaches to treat arthritis pain are inadequate, resulting in unsustained pain relief and substantial adverse effects. Consequently, there is a need to identify therapeutic targets that can both limit disease progression and improve arthritic pain management. The inventors have identified prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and Prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 (EP 4) as promising therapeutic targets in the treatment of arthritis pain. The inventors found that mice with elevated COX-2 expression in the osteocytes of subchondral bone can spontaneously develop osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). COX-2 is also the major producer of PGE2 within the bone, which is a regulator of bone formation. The inventors found that PGE2 activates EP4, enabling sensory innervation, which is a contributor to arthritic pathogenesis. Thus, PGE2, COX-2 and EP4 are all promising targets in the treatment of diseases that causes arthritic pain. The inventors have shown the importance of PGE2, COX-2 and EP4 in mouse models of arthritic disease.",

    "ip_description": "Rechargeable lithium batteries are found in many devices on the market today such as electric vehicles (Nissan Leaf, Tesla cars), Tesla Powerpacks for home electricity storage, and most laptops and cell phones. However, as portable electronics get smaller, the batteries fueling these devices also need to get smaller while still supplying the same or better lifetime per charge. Alternatively, as electric vehicles become more mainstream, they will have to improve upon the range they can travel on a full battery charge (currently ~240 miles). Lithium batteries come in two flavors (lithium polymer and lithium ion) based on their electrolyte and have an energy density of about 150-250 Wh/kg. Lithium-sulfur batteries have a much higher theoretical energy density (up to 2600 Wh/kg), however the technology is not mature. The highest energy density for an available lithium-sulfur battery is at most 500 Wh/kg. One downside of lithium-sulfur batteries is a low cycle life, meaning that they lose their capacity after only a few charge/discharge cycles, due to dissolution of polysulfide intermediates in the electrolyte. While there are many alternative battery technologies to lithium batteries, they each come with their set of pros and cons. Thus, there is need in art for battery technology with higher energy density, lighter weight and better cycle life. Johns Hopkins researchers have incorporated metal-organic frameworks with defects into the electrode of the battery. These defects help retain the sulfur molecules in the electrode which retains the capacity of the battery. These defects have also been functionalized to further improve the capacity of the battery. These batteries have been shown to have an energy density over 3x the current lithium-sulfur batteries on the market, and ~5-6x better than other lithium batteries currently on the market. These batteries also display a 33% higher energy density than the equivalent battery with defect free metal-organic frameworks. The inventors have made and tested these batteries as coin cell batteries, which are about the size of a nickel. These batteries have been tested up to 20 cycles and show a retention in capacity compared to other lithium-sulfur batteries.",

    "ip_description": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer type worldwide and a leading cause of cancer related deaths. HCC is clinically silent in its early stages, leading to diagnosis at more advanced stages when only non-surgical, palliative treatment is available. One treatment option for advanced HCC is intra-arterial therapy and embolization, as the hepatic artery is the tumor\u2019s major blood supply. Transarterial radioembolization (TARE), which combines embolization and radiation therapy, has demonstrated promise for treating HCC. However, current TARE strategies rely on emulsified \u03b2-emitting particles (\u03b2RPT) that are less potent than other radionuclides and have a long range that can expose normal tissue to high doses of radiation and thus toxicity. Post-embolization syndrome (PES) is also a very common side effect of TARE. Consequently, there is a need to develop novel TARE strategies for liver cancer using emulsions that result in lower rates of PES following treatment and radionuclides that are highly damaging over a short range to only cancerous cells. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a novel TARE strategy for HCC and other liver metastases that utilizes \u03b1RPT agents, which are potent, have a short range, and are generally impervious to cellular resistance mechanisms. Prior to delivery to the hepatic artery, these agents are emulsified in the FDA-approved Lipiodol, which has been shown to minimize PES when incorporated into embolization formulas. The researchers generated a preliminary \u03b1RPT-Lipidol emulsion labeled with 225Ac that was injected into the hepatic artery of rabbits with a VX2 liver tumor. This novel \u03b1RPT-Lipidol emulsion accumulated in the tumor but cleared out of normal liver tissue, resulting in a 13:1 tumor to liver ratio. These results indicate that \u03b1RPT-Lipidol emulsions could be a novel delivery mechanism for radionuclides in targeted therapy regimens for primary and metastatic liver cancer. The inventors have identified a novel TARE strategy for improved treatment of advanced-staged liver cancer. Further studies are required to identify optimal and highly potent \u03b1RPT agents capable of accumulating at the tumor site with minimal off-target effects that also demonstrate therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Optimization of radiolabeling and emulsification will be performed along with the development of an \u03b1RPT imaging strategy for guided treatment and prognostication.",

    "ip_description": "Tumor ablation therapy is an approach to remove tumor tissue by minimally invasive surgical procedures. In such procedures, an interventional tool is directed to a target location within the patient\u2019s body that is either close to, or within the tumor tissue. Energy is then delivered to the targeted site to destroy the tumor tissue. Interventional ablation tools utilize radio frequency, lasers, microwaves, and other forms of heat energy to rapidly deliver sufficient energy to destroy tumor cells. During these heat-induced tumor ablation treatments, guidance and ablation process monitoring are crucial, especially when the operation requires high accuracy. However, due to the low contrast between ablated and untreated tissue in ultrasound images, conventional ultrasound imaging is usually not effective for this monitoring. Other imaging modalities including CT and MRI can be incorporated with the ablation therapy and provide effective image guidance and monitoring; however, the requirements of these high-end imaging devices make this approach unaffordable or inaccessible for many patients. The radiation dose and magnetic field compatibility requirements also prevent these methods from being widely used. Therefore, there remains a need for thermal dose monitoring systems for tumor ablation therapy. The safety and accuracy of these procedures could be greatly improved if the operator would be able to monitor the temperature and thus the delivered thermal dose in real time. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University recently developed a novel ultrasound monitoring system for ablation therapy. The disclosed invention uses ultrasound tomography to measure the changes in the speed of sound and intensity during minimally-invasive ablation heating and obtain real-time, three-dimensional thermal maps. Said thermal maps are then used to reconstruct temperature change through a deep learning algorithm and guide thermal ablation of soft tissue. Using this system, the inventors envision a novel treatment technique for many soft tissue targets, such as uterine fibroids, wherein diagnostic ultrasound is used to locate the tumor, focused ultrasound is used to heat and destroy tumor tissue, and ultrasound receivers on the far side of the tumor are used to monitor the treatment progression, providing real-time feedback. Such a treatment modality would enable safe, effective, and inexpensive non-invasive thermal therapy without the need for MRI, the current standard monitoring modality.",

There is a need for a methodology, whether it be a new technology or a new protocol, that is accurate, precise, and patient comfort oriented. The inventors have proposed a design for a surgical device and new protocol for the delivery of retinal stem cells to the subretinal space. They have developed a novel delivery platform to access the subretinal space through the trans-scleral side, different from the current retinal incision methodology. This device features an optical tomography-based imaging device to be able to view the currently opaque sclera. It includes a novel flexible cannula and injector system that safely navigates this propagation tunnel. Furthermore, it consists of a microfluidic platform to lift the product of the injector without touching, improving on the current plunger system that exerts force and risks damaging the region. This new surgical device and system for the device address all the problems of accuracy, precision, repeatability, and patient comfort while circumventing the high rate of complications that occur in these procedures. The inventors have proposed a novel retinal implantation device with a corresponding novel protocol to perform the surgery. They plan improve on their design as they develop their prototype.",

    "ip_description": "Chemogenetics is defined as a method by which proteins are made to interact with small molecules, typically neurological molecules, as they have never been interacted with before. There is a powerful and versatile approach for remote and momentary manipulation of cellular activity called Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD). Mutated human muscarinic receptors are activated by this \u201cdesigner drug\u201d rather than other typical neurotransmitters. Currently, there exists needs for improvement in DREADD methods and compositions, specifically there is a need for new compounds directed to treating diseases and disorders in subjects. These subjects have currently only amounted to lab animals, and there is a need to delve into clinical testing. Chemogenetics has the potential to have a large research and eventual clinical impact, because engineered proteins can have enormous implications on overall health.\n\nThe inventors have proposed multiple new compounds and a new methodology to be applied to this DREADD method. Their invention provides compounds that consist of a pharmaceutical composition along with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In addition, they have also proposed a method that can utilize these compounds to effect a GPCR-mediated response as a method to treat diseases or disorders. This hinges on their method for administering this pharmaceutically acceptable salt (any of their proposed compounds) to the subject. This method and new compounds will allow for further chemogenetic neurological manipulation with more efficiency, accuracy, and an overall movement towards clinical applications.\n\nThe inventors have created prototypes for their compounds and have performed tests to determine the accuracy and effectiveness of their new method of \u201cdesigner drug\u201d delivery.

    "ip_description": "Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death in American men and it is estimated that approximately 164,690 new cases will be diagnosed in 2018. Elevated prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) serves as a biomarker for prostate cancer and as well as primary clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC). However, PSMA is also expressed in normal organs such as the kidney, lacrimal glands, and salivary glands. Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) has been used to diagnose and treat prostate cancer with some success by targeting PSMA with radiolabeled tracers and inhibitors. Due to PSMA expression in these various healthy organs, RPT can cause undesirable non-target organ uptake of the radiotracer/inhibitor and off-target effects, including dry mouth and renal toxicity. Consequently, there is a need for a novel method to reduce the off-target impact of RPT but maintain high tumor uptake, to better diagnose and treat prostate cancer and ccRCC. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a method of co-injecting a non-radiolabeled PSMA inhibitor that competes with the radiolabeled PSMA inhibitor during RPT. This combination reduced uptake of the radiotracer in the non-target organs and only led to a small reduction in tumor uptake in mice. Their competitive inhibitor used demonstrated high tumor and renal uptake, which will minimize renal retention of the radiolabeled tracer, allow for better detection of ccRCC, and reduce renal toxicity and dry mouth that are common side effects of RPT. The inventors have developed a novel RPT method to minimize undesirable non-target organ uptake and effects when RPT is used to treat and diagnose both prostate cancer and ccRCC. Further studies are needed to investigate efficacy in human patients and determine optimal dosing and delivery in humans.",

    "ip_description": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) uses radio-frequency coils to transmit and receive signals from material such as human tissue. Currently, there exist forward-looking coils that can image the tissue that is in front of the coil. Forward-looking coils for imaging the cervix gland, which is 20-30 mm from the coil\u2019s end, are easy to build with current coil technology. However, it is much more difficult with current conventional-coil geometries to build a coil that can image further above the cervix into the endometrium. Thus, there exists unmet need for forward-looking radio frequency coil technology that can image further above the cervix to determine the extent of tumors found in advanced cervical-cancer patients. In advanced cervical cancer, the cancer has spread from its primary location in the cervix and is found also in the vagina and endometrium, so an extended visualization region is required in order to visualize the entire tumor. Johns Hopkins researchers have designed effective extended forward-looking coils. Image fields can be demonstrated by placing a loop of wire at a certain distance above the surface of a metal, oriented so it is parallel to the plane of the surface. When a radio frequency current runs through the loop, a primary magnetic field is created. These magnetic fields induce a transient magnetic field in the metal. The metal then builds a surface current, which induces an opposing-directionality magnetic field, called an image magnetic field, which exactly cancels the primary field on the metal surface. As a result, there are now have two fields, the primary magnetic field and an image magnetic field. In the region between the location of the loop and the metal, these two fields are in opposing directions and create a smaller net field, while above the loop, they are oriented in the same direction and therefore reinforce the primary field, creating a larger net field. This larger field therefore contributes to a larger magnetic field at locations above coil, leading to an extended field. Several simulations have been conducted with prototypes that have been built for the 1.5 Tesla Siemens scanner. A final prototype is being built and tested.",

    "ip_description": "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a hereditary condition caused by a mutation in the APC tumor suppressor gene, with a reported incidence of 1 in 7,000 to 1 in 22,000 individuals. Patients with FAP develop thousands of colorectal polyps that will eventually become malignant, resulting in colorectal cancer later in life. The onset and frequency of these polyps vary within families that have the same APC mutation, indicating that there are additional, unknown factors contributing to disease onset, which could include microbiome composition. An understanding of the microbiota associated with pre-cancerous lesions in hereditary colorectal cancer is needed and could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for the prevention of colorectal cancer and colectomy in FAP patients. Johns Hopkins researchers have identified the presence of a biofilm comprised primarily of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) and/or psk+ Escherichia coli in the majority of patients with FAP who had colonic tumors. Murine modeling of the co-colonization of ETBF and psk+ E. coli also demonstrated that their virulence factors were responsible for tumor formation and enhanced bacterial adherence in the colon. These results indicate that of the trillions of bacteria in the colon microbiota, these two species can be sufficient to induce tumorigenesis, especially in patients with FAP. Targeting ETBF and psk+ E. coli in the colon and disrupting their mucosal adherence through a vaccine or another technology could delay onset of colon tumorigenesis and inevitable colectomy in FAP patients. Screening for these bacteria in non-FAP patients could also identify those with higher risk of colorectal cancer. The inventors have identified two bacterial strains in the colon microbiota of FAP patients that are associated with colon tumorigenesis. Targeting these bacterial strains at or soon after birth in FAP patients could represent a novel method of delaying or preventing colorectal cancer. The efficacy of this proposed therapeutic strategy will be evaluated in animal models and human patients.",

    "ip_description": "Globally, 733 million people are visually impaired. In the US the economic burden of eye disorders and vision loss is estimated to be over $100 Billion per year. Visual prosthesis devices are used to restore partial vision or improve vision. These devices operate based on neuronal electrical stimulation at different locations along the visual pathways within the central nervous system, with a crucial functionality for any visual prosthesis device being obstacle detection. Current retinal implant prosthesis devices exist that stimulate the retina based on the brightness of the object in the receptive field of the implant, thus providing their wearers with enough visual information to orient themselves with respect to stationary and moving light sources and to discern large shapes. However, one of the largest challenges with retinal prostheses is that their limited resolution, depth perception, and contrast makes image understanding very difficult for the wearers in real-life situations. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a technology and method for improving the resolution and depth perception capabilities of retinal prostheses. C15085 will allow wearers to select the portions of the image presented to the user on the basis of their distance, with a mechanism to select the band of distances that are of interest. This will provide users with an improved ability to discern obstacles and moving objects compared to existing devices and will additionally provide users with the ability to select the distances they are observing. In a rapidly growing bionic eye market ($1.5 Billion by 2026, 74.3% CAGR), this product has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of visual prosthesis functionality for millions of visually impaired people. The researchers have prototyped and tested their improved method on the primary existing FDA approved commercial retinal implant. They have validated the improved ability of users to detect large and small objects and to judge the relative distances of objects on a table and pieces of furniture in a room.",

    "ip_description": "The critically important goal of regenerative medicine is the stimulation of in vivo wound healing and the production of functional tissue to repair or replace tissues loss to injury or disease. Extracellular matrix (ECM) materials are acellular tissue derived scaffolds commonly used in tissue regeneration following malignant or benign tumor resections, as ECM promotes pro-regenerative processes such as cell proliferation, angiogenesis, stem-cell recruitment, and type 2 immune responses. While these processes are favorable for tissue repair, they are also critical for the formation of solid tumors. Presently, it is unknown if these regenerative, ECM-based strategies for tissue repair also provide a fertile environment for de novo or recurrent tumor formation. This could be problematic if ECM material is used to for clinical reconstruction following resection of cancerous tumors. Consequently, there is a need to determine the effects of ECM material on the establishment of a pro-tumor microenvironment in vivo. Johns Hopkins researchers determined that pro-regenerative urinary bladder ECM material (UBM) inhibited the formation of tumors in a B16-F10 melanoma mouse model in an immune-dependent manner. The UBM particle scaffold led to a biased Th2-M2 type 2, anti-inflammatory immune profile and also increased recruitment of both myeloid and lymphoid cells. This type-2 skewed immune phenotype and tumor inhibition was ablated upon implementation of the UBM scaffold in lymphocyte deficient mice (Rag1-/-). Tumor inhibition and the UBM material response was rescued by the repopulation of CD4+ T-cells. The inventors demonstrated that decellularized ECM materials used in regenerative applications do not appear to promote melanoma tumor formation in vivo. Future studies will be conducted to determine if this tumor inhibition occurs in humans for a wide variety of cancers and ECM materials and if synergizing this ECM-derived immune environment with immunotherapeutics will enhance killing of tumors and metastases in patients.",

Currently most can be repaired via the \u201cminimally invasive\u201d endovascular approach, in which a bifurcated, fabric-covered, sleeve is introduced through the femoral arteries, relining the aorta with a smaller flow channel, and diverting blood away from the expanding aneurysm sac. Success of the procedure largely depends on having an adequate landing zone below the arteries to the kidneys.\n\nIn circumstances where there is an inadequate landing zone, more complicated procedures become necessary.

Two main ways to optimize the efficiency of solar cells are by creating new materials with excellent solar cell properties and by improving the architecture of the device to increase efficiency. Currently, Silicon based solar cells dominate the market, but this technology is energy intensive to produce, rigid, brittle, and require large amounts of material. Development in 3rd generation solar cells promises cost effective solutions by optimizing two factors: the solar cell\u2019s material and architecture. 3rd gen solution-based materials allow for the use of a fraction of the material, are tunable to different light conditions, and can be flexible, lightweight, and semi-transparent for expanded applications. Unfortunately, 3rd generation materials are currently less efficient than traditional Si-based solar cells. Thus, there is need in art for new technologies that can improve the 3rd generation solution by improving efficiency and reducing cost. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed an economical method to maximize light absorption by mechanical design. They made compact concentrators for solar cells using 3D-printed plastic molds and flexible, transparent polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) lenses. Attaching mini-concentrator lenses (3rd generation concentrators) to thin film solar cells can effectively enlarge the active area of the devices, compensate for film non-uniformity, increase the power output of the devices without adding more active material, and potentially increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices through improved open circuit voltage. Their lens transmits over 70% of the incoming solar radiation, and the resulting integrated system can deliver up to 20 times the short circuit current.",

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), or brittle bone disease, is most often caused by dominant mutations in the collagen I genes COL1A1/COL1A2, whereas rarer recessive OI is often caused by mutations in genes encoding collagen I-interacting proteins. Recently, mutations in the gene for the proteinase bone morphogenetic 1 (BMP1) were reported in two recessive OI families. BMP1 and the closely related proteinase mammalian tolloid-like 1 (mTLL1) being co-expressed in various tissues, including bone, and have overlapping activities that include biosynthetic processing of procollagen precursors into mature collagen monomers. However, early lethality of Bmp1- and Tll1-null mice has precluded use of such models for careful study of in vivo roles of their protein products. This technology is the establishment of a novel animal model that avoids barriers of Bmp1\u2212/\u2212 and Tll1\u2212/\u2212 lethality and issues of functional redundancy.

    "ip_description": "This invention involves a novel method to immortalize Nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. DRG neurons are terminally differentiated cells that extend long axons to their target tissues. More than half of all DRG neurons are unmyelinated axons that extend to the skin and have nociceptive properties. In many studies on peripheral neuropathies and neuropathic pain, rat or mouse primary DRG neurons are used. However, obtaining these cells in sufficient quantities to perform high-throughput drug screening is nearly impossible. In order to immortalize rat DRG neurons, yet keep them in a state where they can stop dividing and differentiate into neurons with axons, we used a two-step transformation process. After double transformation, we are able to grow the cells through multiple doublings without loss of differentiation potential. These immortalized cells can be grown in large quantities, differentiated into nociceptive sensory neurons and can be used in high-throughput drug screening for neuropathic pain and peripheral neuropathy research.\n\nMost researchers, including large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies working on neuropathic pain and peripheral neuropathies use dorsal root ganglion neurons as a model cell type to examine the effects of drugs on the biology of pain-sensitive (nociceptive) neurons. However, cell numbers that can be obtained are very limited with primary DRG neurons. It is almost impossible to do high-throughput drug screening with the currently available cells. An alternative is to use neuronal cell lines derived from neuroblastomas or other cancers but in this instance the issue is relevance to neuropathic pain research. These cells are often heterogeneous and do not respond to drugs in consistent manner. The nociceptive DRG neuronal cell lines that we have developed are clonal lines; therefore all of the cells are similar to each other and in biological assays behave in a predictable manner. These cells can be grown in large quantities, differentiated into nociceptive neurons that express proper markers and ion channels necessary for nociception and generation of action potentials, and used in high-throughput drug screening.\n\nThe transfection and selection methods developed as part of this invention can also be used to generate other neuronal populations, including neurons from human tissues such as brain, spinal cord, dorsal root sensory ganglia and autonomic ganglia. These methods would allow one to generate large quantities of neurons for high-throughput drug screening for various neurological diseases.\n\nKey Benefits \n\n Cells are homogenous and behave in a predictable manner in biological assays.\nCells can be grown in large quantities and can be differentiated into nociceptive neurons that express proper markers and ion channels for nociception and generation of action potentials, and can be used for high-throughput drug screening.",

    "ip_description": "Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter genes and PET (positron-emission tomography) imagining are two techniques which have been widely used to monitor the movement and distribution of specific molecules in cells or animals. Imaging GFP-tagged molecules is often destructive to the sample and is limited by the degree that light can penetrate the tissue. PET imaging is dependent on administering an exogenous radionuclide-labeled agent that can have difficulty reaching and specifically binding to its target\u2014an especially difficult task if crossing the blood-brain barrier. The method of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recognized as another powerful non-invasive imaging modality offering near-cellular spatial resolution permitting single-cell imaging. To optimally utilize CEST-MRI, there remains a need for reporter genes that are detectable by CEST-MRI with high sensitivity without the need of exogenous probes or substrates. Johns Hopkins researchers have created artificial reporter proteins that demonstrate substantial contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance images by CEST-MRI. The overall concept of CEST reporter genes is similar to existing reporter GFP genes. CEST reporter genes encoding artificial proteins rich in lysine or arginine were generated and demonstrated to substantially enhance contrast in CEST MR imaging, without altering cellular metabolism. Using specific radiofrequencies, the CEST-MRI reporter system allows double- or triple-labeling and detection strategies using combinations of different artificial proteins. Inventors showed that CEST MRI can be used to image hematopoietic cells, stem cells and tumor cells stably transfected with such an artificial reporter gene(s). The invention also solves the problems of tracking labeled cells as an exogenous label dilutes with cell division and discriminating between live and dead cells. More recently, evidence was presented for the use of the CEST reporter gene in monitoring oncolytic virus therapy. Importantly, CEST reporter genes permit non-invasive and repetitive monitoring with 3D whole body imaging without dependence on light penetration. Together, this technology presents a powerful new tool that may be broadly useful to non-invasively label and track biodistribution and migration of single cells for purposes of evaluating efficacy of gene therapy and monitoring cell therapy.",

The fundamental cause of ALS is unknown and as a result treatment options are primarily restricted to physical therapy to help prolong muscle strength. In the last decade the TDP-43 protein, which prevents abnormal RNA splicing from occurring, has been identified as having a central role in the pathogenicity of 97% of ALS cases. An understanding of how TDP-43 causes ALS is essential to the development of efficacious therapeutics. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have identified a novel approach to treating ALS by restoring TDP-43 activity in the nucleus and preventing abnormal RNA splicing. This approach was identified by inducing ALS symptoms in mice and flies by removing TDP-43 in motor neurons using Cre-Lox recombination technology.

    "ip_description": "Johns Hopkins researchers have discovered a protein molecule that synergizes with current therapies and helps stimulate the immune system to fight cancers. This molecule activates the immune system leading to the production of killer T-cells that are capable of destroying tumors. Mice given an anti-cancer vaccine that included this protein as an adjuvant had a tumor burden of less than half that of the group treated with just the vaccine after 22 days in a breast cancer model. These adjuvant treated mice also produced more antibodies against the tumor cells used in the experiment and had a longer life span. Treatment with this protein activates the immune system but it also leads to the over production of PD-L1. Increased expression of PD-L1 is one of the main ways that cancer cells are able to subvert detection by the immune system. Interestingly, this effect might make tumors more susceptible to concomitant immune checkpoint therapies. Mice treated with the experimental protein and anti-PD1 antibody had half the tumor volume of mice treated with only anti-PD1 after 15 days. Use of this protein looks to add value either as a recombinant companion therapy to current immune checkpoint inhibitors or as an adjuvant to cancer vaccines.",

    "ip_description": "Approximately 253 million people worldwide live with vision impairment. Of those with vision impairment, approximately 15% are blind. Most human blindness is caused by the dysfunction or death of retinal photoreceptors. For many eye disorders, there is no way to reverse photoreceptor loss, and efforts to treat vision loss are aimed at slowing or preventing the disease. Current methods to produce retinal photoreceptors are challenging, laborious and limit research efforts into understanding the mechanisms of photoreceptor death. Consequently, a better method of generating retinal photoreceptors is needed to improve research efforts and develop therapies for restoration of vision in affected individuals. The inventors have identified an approach to robustly generate pure populations of retinal photoreceptors. The inventors selectively inactivating a family of transcription factors: Nfia, Nfib, and Nfix, individually and in combination, in the retina of mice. This inactivation led late-stage retinal progenitors to proliferate into rod photoreceptors and additional progenitors. Thus, the inventors were able to produce a high yield population of retinal photoreceptors from retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). Importantly, the inventors used single cell RNA-sequencing to compare these cell culture-produced retinal photoreceptors to normal rods, and found they had similar expression profiles. The inventors have tested mice with Nfia, Nfib, and Nfix all inactivated in the retina and found that this led to the development of pure rod photoreceptor populations, with similar characteristics to normal rods.",

    "ip_description": "Balloon catheters are commonly used in open vascular and emergency trauma surgery. Often times, placement of the balloon catheter into the artery or vein is done without imaging guidance because of the use of balloon catheters during emergency surgical procedures. However, successful placement of the balloon catheter is necessary because misplacement of the balloon catheter can cause severe damage to organs and complicate the surgery procedure by incorrectly augmenting the flow of blood. Difficulty is often encountered when the balloon catheter cannot successfully pass through the blood vessel due to minor clots along the walls of the vessel. For victims of torso trauma, when a tamponade is not amenable, a balloon catheter may be used in order to augment the flow of blood to more proximal organs. As a result, blood flow is temporarily blocked to the lower half of the body. During vascular surgery, balloon catheters are also commonly used. One of the most common emergency vascular surgeries, atrial fibrillation-mediated cardio emboli, involves cutting the artery to open the vessel and pass inflatable balloon embolectomy catheters proximally and distally to clear out an occlusion in the vessel. Currently there is need in art that aids in the successful blind maneuvering of balloon catheters during such vascular and torso trauma surgeries. Johns Hopkins researchers have designed a modified balloon catheter with an addition of a wire component that has a flexible and backwards bending tip so that light radial force is exerted on the blood vessel wall when placed inside the blood vessel. This wire component, dubbed the flagella, forks into three parts which ensures that the catheter is centered inside of the blood vessel that it is placed into by stabilizing itself against the radial walls of the vessel. This flagella also ensures the smooth, blind passage of the balloon across areas of irregularity within the blood vessel such as blood clots or build up along radial vessel walls to make sure that the catheter is successfully placed and does not pass into side branches of the blood vessel instead. Currently there are no balloon catheter wires on the market that specifically addressing the need for maneuvering catheters without imaging guidance past obstructions or deviations within blood vessels. The proposed balloon catheter design holds significant potential especially for use in emergency surgical procedures.",

Further, obesity leads to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality via multiple adverse mechanisms that include increased prevalence and severity of hypertension (often resistant to treatment) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Currently, no pharmacotherapy exists for OSA. CPAP machine use for OSA management is minimally effective, improving blood pressure control in only 20-30% of compliant patients. Thus, OSA and hypertension treatment in the context of obesity pose a significant therapeutic challenge and new therapeutic options are desperately needed, particularly those that do not require strict daily or monthly dosing and patient adherence. Johns Hopkins researchers have demonstrated that obesity exacerbates hypertension and OSA via increased levels of the obesity associated hormone, leptin, which acts through the transient receptor potential channel in the carotid body (CB). The inhibitor abolishes the adverse effects of leptin in obesity. As a result, the researchers identified that long-term, topical administration of a hydrogel form of the inhibitor to the CB area could be a potential novel therapeutic for hypertension and OSA in obese individuals. The inventors are developing a hydrogel that will be evaluated as a therapeutic for hypertension as well as for OSA in a mouse model of obesity.",

Enhancement of Treg function could treat autoimmune diseases while the inhibition or elimination of Treg cells could enhance immunotherapy of cancer and infectious diseases. Johns Hopkins researchers have identified a Treg specific receptor named neuritin. Neuritin is highly expressed in Treg cells and can bind activated dendritic cells (DCs). When neuritin is over-expressed on T cells it can inhibit both DC cytokine production and antigen presentation which in turn limits the immune response. These findings identify neuritin as a Treg specific surface molecule able to affect DC function. This invention centers on the manipulation of Tregs and DCs via neuritin receptor molecule to enhance immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases, cancers and infectious diseases as well as enhance lymphocyte engraftment in settings of donor lymphocyte infusion, bone marrow transplantation and adoptive transfer.

    "ip_description": "In theory, RNA interference (RNAi) can be used to decrease expression of any gene driving a disease or pathology, but has seen limited clinical usage as gene therapy due to technical issues, i.e., small interfering RNA (siRNA) cannot enter cells efficiently due to their weight and charge. As such, a carrier molecule is needed to bring siRNA into the cell. Unfortunately, there is a lack of suitable carriers to deliver siRNA. For example, cationic polymers, polysaccharides and dextran have been considered as potential carriers because siRNA may be attached by electrostatic interactions or covalent conjugation. To date, a number of possible carrier molecule types have demonstrated varying levels of success. An ideal transmission vector for siRNA delivery should protect siRNA from degradation, increase siRNA to the target and facilitate its cellular uptake and subsequent release.\n\nHopkins researchers discovered a novel method to efficiently synthesize a biodegradable dextran to use as an efficient cationic nanopolymer carrier for siRNA delivery. Small molecules containing amine groups were conjugated to a dextran scaffold through acetal bonds. The dextran carrier is taken up by the cell where acidic conditions in endocytic cellular compartments will cause the acetal bonds to break, releasing its siRNA, imaging or labeling agents (e.g., rhodamine, Cy5.5), from the amine group on the naturally biodegradable dextran carrier.\n\nUsing this novel synthesis process, Hopkins scientists attached siRNA and labeled dextran amine groups with the two different imaging agents. Data demonstrated that the dextran carrier was taken into the cells by endocytosis, whose acidic environment broke the bonds of the acetal group, releasing the siRNA, rhodamine-labeled amine groups and the Cy5.5-labeled from the dextran platform. The rapid cleavage and release of amine groups minimized the proinflammatory side effects of the positively charged amine groups. Altogether, this novel synthesis methodology demonstrated the ability to modify the dextran scaffold with a variety of functional groups such as imaging reporters and therapeutic moieties, but avoids crosslinking the dextran scaffold.\n\nHopkins researchers were able to confirm the results by colorimetric assay, NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography. Fluorescence imaging showed that the dextran siRNA nanoplex entered the cells through endocytosis and was able to effectively deliver cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) siRNA. The qRT-PCR assay showed that the COX2 siRNA/dextran nanoplex downregulated COX-2 expression efficiently. COX-2 siRNA/dextran treatment decreased prostaglandin E2 levels significantly. It was also demonstrated that the treatment can accumulate in tumors. qRT-PCR and Western blot assays showed the nanoplex significantly decreased COX-2 expression in mouse tumor tissue.",

Robot assisted surgery causes fewer complications because it is more precise so fewer errors are made, and because it is easily sterilized and only used for operations, fewer infections occur. These fewer complications paired with more precision which means no unnecessary cuts means patients recover more quickly as well. It also causes less pain and less blood loss because of its precision. The precision in cutting also means the scars are smaller and less noticeable. Current products on the market such as da Vinci and MicroSurge work and are used in a wide range on procedures. These robotic systems include master-slave manual control strategy with a limited form of autonomy. This limits the ability of the robot which is prominent in its ability to be autonomous. There is a lack of robotic surgery alternatives which make better use of the autonomous abilities of the robots. It is when the robots are autonomous that they can operate with increased precision. The main objective of this invention is to further improve the efficiency and the outcomes of RAS systems by combining the best elements of automation with the complementary skills of a human surgeon. The invention will increase the superiority of automating procedures by leveraging greater accuracy and repeatability. Automation in complex surgical environments is not infallible so it allows human operators to control elements of riskier motions.

    "ip_description": "Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in the male population; roughly one out of ten men will be diagnosed at some point in their lives. Efficient screening and accurate diagnosis is a public health imperative due to the large potential patient population. Prostate cancer is usually diagnosed following an abnormal physical exam, blood work, and a tissue biopsy. Surprisingly, the majority of the approximately one million prostate biopsies performed annually in the U.S. find no cancer. Moreover, prostate biopsies often detect clinically insignificant cancers leading to unnecessary treatment and repeat biopsies. Development of noninvasive and more accurate methods of prostate cancer detection, particularly of aggressive/high-risk cancers, will reduce unnecessary biopsies and improve prostate cancer management. Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a noninvasive diagnostic test that is able to detect prostate cancer from cells shed into a simple urine sample. The technology takes advantage of differential RNA expression between normal and cancer prostate cells using RNA in situ hybridization (RISH). A panel of RISH probes were selected from RNA sequencing data that identified RNA markers specific to prostate cancer. RISH probes produce a fluorescent signal with higher sensitivity than immunohistochemistry staining and are capable of differentiating between normal and cancer prostate cells. Cancer risk can also be assessed by clinically relevant biomarkers. The inventors have demonstrated proof-of-concept by detecting and analyzing prostate cancer cells in patients\u2019 urine samples.",

The inventor proposes two cancer cell lines in culture: The first is when the cancer cells are introduced into organs with severely compromised circulations, thus allowing blood vessels to grow. The patient is then treated with ganciclovir to kill the cancer cells and leaves the newly grown blood vessels behind. The second line is where the cancer cells bond to a matrix and is applied to the surface of a wound or compromised tissue. Cancer cells produce the proper concentrations of angiogenic growth factors to promote blood vessel growth.

    "ip_description": "Type I diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by destruction of pancreatic beta-cells, leading to insulin deficiency and high blood glucose levels. In 2015, 1.3 million Americans had T1D, with approximately 1.5 million new cases of diabetes diagnosed each year. Despite advances in research, the incidence of T1D in children continues to increase by 3-5% annually, indicating a need for highly sensitive and specific diagnostics. The detection of T1D autoantibodies, including those against insulin, islet antigen 2 (IA2), and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), can predict one\u2019s risk for the onset of symptomatic disease. In addition to these major biomarkers, autoantibodies to zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A) have recently been identified as another biomarker detected in 60-80% of newly diagnosed T1D cases. Due to the fact that ZnT8A occurs in the prodromal phase of disease prior to clinical onset, including it in biomarker panel would greatly improve accuracy of T1D prediction. However, due to the inability to maintain proper folding of the ZnT8 protein outside of its native environment, existing assays for detecting ZnT8A are limited to only the protein\u2019s soluble domains. Consequently, in order to improve ZnT8A detection and sensitivity, there is a need for a more effective method to express full length protein in vitro that maintains all accessible autoreactive ZnT8A binding sites for improved T1D prediction and diagnosis, particularly at very early stages of disease. Johns Hopkins researchers developed a proteoliposome-based full length ZnT8 self-antigen (PLR-ZnT8) for efficient detection of Znt8A. The lipid matrix of the proteliposome provided a protective environment that improved folding and structural stability of ZnT8, allowing for complete access to all autoreactive sites and high affinity capture of ZnT8A from T1D sera. The PLR-ZnT8 achieved a 76% sensitivity and 97% specificity, which far surpassed the sensitivities achieved when using only soluble domains of the protein. The researchers also successfully multiplexed the IA2 and GAD proteins with ZnT8 for a more comprehensive assay for the detection of T1D autoantibodies. Although the current studies were accomplished on a plasmonic gold chip (pGOLD), the assay is tunable to other multiplexed systems. The inventors have developed a novel, microarray-based, multiplex assay for T1D autoantibody detection that could potentially be used to better diagnose and predict T1D in its early stages. Further experimentation is required to improve sensitivity and optimize the assay to screen for pre-symptomatic T1D in the most at-risk populations.",

    "ip_description": "As the medical world begins to embrace the implementation of robotics into their clinical applications, there is a just as important growing market towards their safety in their use, as patient safety is the number one priority. In the field of otology, there has been a significant increase in the use of operative endoscopes. The problem with the current use of endoscopes is that the surgeon must hold the endoscope with one hand and perform the surgery with the other. One handed surgeries are wrought with inefficiency and increased difficulty of placing implants and grafts. Although some solutions have been developed, a holder for the endoscope for example, no solutions have actually brought viable change to the field. The previous example has a shortcoming in that it is rigid and stationary, in which if the patient\u2019s head moves there would be catastrophic consequences. Therefore there is a need for a safe and effective technology to permit the use of endoscopes in such a way that surgeons are able to use both hands. The inventors have proposed a technology to solve the shortcomings of current solutions. They have come up with an endoscope held by a tool holder that is held by a robot manipulated device. There is a sensor, called an accelerometer, on the patient\u2019s head that is able to detect and provide feedback to a controller about the movement of the head. If it detects sudden head motion, the controller releases the latch, causing the endoscope to retract out of the head. This would allow for the surgeon to not have to recognize patient motion and permits more focus on the surgery itself. In addition, this allows for more efficient surgery as the surgeon has one less task to focus on while also being able to use two hands more often. The tool improves the efficiency and accuracy of the surgery while having patient safety as the number one priority. Furthermore, this system can applied to a variety of surgeries with similar requirements and restraints. The inventors have developed a system with a safety feature for the use with robotically manipulated endoscopes and other tools. They have received various funding, including NIH, and will continue to do their research in improving surgical safety while also delving into other fields beyond otology to apply their system towards.",

Yet, no cure exists for AD, and AD therapeutics presently on the market fail to treat the disease\u2019s underlying causes. Recent studies in mice reveal that exosomes released from glial cells contribute to the propagation of tau, which are a hallmark of AD. Neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), which is critically involved in exosome synthesis, achieves this in part through its production of ceramide, a lipid that is elevated post-mortem in human AD. Further, pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of nSMase2 significantly has been shown to decrease tau propagation and improve cognition. Taken together, these provide a compelling rationale for the development of nSMas2 inhibitors as AD therapeutics. However, current inhibitors to nSMase2 have low potency, poor solubility and limited brain penetration, thereby limiting their therapeutic potential. JHU researchers have identified an inhibitor of human nSMase2, MS882, with nanomolar potency. This noncompetitive inhibitor is metabolically stable and exhibits high brain penetrance. When dosed systemically in mice, MS882 blocked IL1-beta-induced glial exosome release, prevented brain cytokine upregulation, and attenuated neutrophil migration into the brain. Additionally, no overt toxicological signs were observed in mice treated with MS882. This invention has been shown to inhibit exosome release in vivo and in vitro.

During ERCP, selective cannulation is the process of gaining access to either the biliary duct or pancreatic duct through the duodenal papilla. One of the main problems with cannulation is that the orientation of the ducts behind the entrypoint cannot be visualized. This lack of visualization makes it difficult to correctly position and orient the accessories used to enter the ducts. If the endoscopist fails within a certain time limit or after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts to access the bile duct for further therapeutic interventions using their regular cannulation technique, the procedure is called a difficult cannulation. The most dangerous complication of the ERCP procedure is pancreatitis, a life-threatening condition that occurs in 5% of cases often because of multiple failed cannulation attempts resulting in tissue irritation. Patients can also develop pancreatitis from this procedure when doctors use contrast to visualize the pancreatic and biliary ducts under fluoroscopy. Although the contrast chemicals are a current method of visualization, their use irritates the pancreatic duct further. This invention provides the physician with information about the location and orientation of the bile ducts without requiring the use of contrast. Instead, Indocyanine Green (ICG) is used to fluoresce the bile duct. The ICG binds to plasma proteins and the bound ICG emits light when illuminated with near-infrared light. Intravenously injected ICG is excreted by the liver into the bile and can be detected approximately 15 minutes after the injection and continues to be detected for a couple of hours. Fluorescent imaging has been used to visualize the bile duct and gallbladder through a laparoscopic camera, but has never before been applied for use in ERCP or with duodenoscopes. The invention involves two main elements, a fluorescence imaging system for visualization of the bile duct after ICG injection and a fluorophore or phosphorescence-coated guidewire to enable physicians to visualize the guidewire during insertion into the bile duct. This invention has the potential to make an impact on therapeutic endoscopy by making the ERCP procedure safer and easier for physicians to be trained on and perform. The team has performed successful ex-vivo experiments using proof-of-concept prototypes. The invention\u2019s clinical efficacy will be validated in live porcine animal testing. These experiments will be used to iterate prototypes and optimize the invention\u2019s impact.",

Imaging techniques such as MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound are used for disease prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of many medical conditions. Each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages. MRI and ultrasound provide good soft tissue contrast while X-ray does not; however, X-ray provides good spatial resolution, limited in ultrasound and MRI. This leaves an unmet need in the medical imagining market \u2013 there is a need for imaging methods that provide good tissue contrast with strong spatial resolution. The proposed technology uses X-ray differential phase-contrast (PC) which is a method that involves using the phase change of the X-ray beam to create images. This method allows to strongly enhance the visibility of soft tissues such as cartilage, tendons, blood vessels, arterial plaque, brain tissue and tumors. By using multiple closely spaced views each with a different interferometer phasing, X-ray phase-contrasting can allow for images that offer both good spatial resolution and good soft tissue contrast. This technology can be used for high accuracy mammograms when low X-ray energy is used. With high energy X-rays, the technology can be used for whole-body radiography. At high energy X-ray phase contrast can discriminate very well between arterial wall, low density lipid deposits, and fibrosis or calcified plaque capsule. It is important to note, that this technology has application outside of the medical field and can be used, for example, for industrial quality scanning and security imaging. Objects such as suitcases can be scanned for security purposes, while composite industrial objects can be scanned for defects using this technology. A prototype has been developed and used in trials to demonstrate the feasibility of the technology. Schematics for the commercially usable product have been made by the inventors.",

    "ip_description": "Tissue regeneration is a large part of a huge market for redeveloping tissues that have been damaged or have lost functionality. The success of tissue regenerative therapies is dependent on functional and multicellular vasculature within the redeveloping tissue. The problem with human endothelial cells (EC), which line the vasculature\u2019s inner lining, is that although they form natural networks, they regress without the supporting cells (pericytes) that surround endothelium. Current solutions addressing this problem include using distinct cell sources of EC\u2019s and pericytes within naturally occurring matrices. But there is limited clinically-relevant human cell sources and an inherent problem of translating chemical properties to the natural physical properties of the human. There is a need to create some approach to construct clinically-relevant microvascular networks in the body that are functional and permanent. The inventors have proposed self-organized vascular networks from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells (hPSCs) in a synthetic matrix. They are able to derive Early Vascular Cells (EVCs) from these hPSCs due to the properties of morphogenesis, in which hPSCs are able to codifferentiate into these EVCs. These EVCs then mature into endothelial cells and pericytes, allowing them to self-organize to form micro-vascular networks in an engineered matrix. These engineered human vascular networks survive implantation, integrate with the host vasculature, and establish blood flow. This not only addresses the problem of effectively and efficiently regenerating vascular networks that were destroyed or impaired, it also opens up large opportunities for vascular construction and regenerative medicine as a whole.",

Because their numbers are small, they are not easily detected. Through CTC capture, valuable information can be uncovered regarding a tumor\u2019s link to cancer diagnosis or treatment. One method of detecting CTCs is using liquid biopsies, which analyzes liquid bits of tumor material that are found in bodily fluids. Cancer patients only have between 5-50 CTCs per teaspoon of blood, making it incredibly difficult to isolate CTC. For detection, immunocytochemical magnetophoretic CTC isolation devices are used to identify surface antigens and distinguish them from other cells. However, current devices have difficulty quantifying and controlling sample loss, and rely on random mixing methods that may lead to a misrepresentation. Johns Hopkins researchers have invented a new CTC extraction device (CTC-X) for analyzing liquid biopsies. This technology offers a controlled scanning process for CTC antibody binding, rather than the classic random mixing, in order to yield high CTC recovery. The proposed invention also uses a novel magnetophoretic direct extraction method to isolate CTCs onto a standard slide. The CTC solution is placed in a vial with antibody-bound PMP (beads) to initiate a binding reaction. A magnetic field is implemented into a helical motion by rotating electromagnets and translating the vial, in order to transfer the CTCs onto a slide for visualization. This invention offers a lossless CTC isolation solution (100% recovery) for determining patient tailored treatments. This invention has been tested in research labs in the Department of Urology to determine the efficacy of the device. The inventors compared individual cell count before scanning/transferring to the cell count after scanning/transferring. As a result, the CTC recovery rate was 100 percent.",

Force/torque sensors are susceptible to many modes of failure due to accidents, misuse, or hazards in the environment. Sensors can also generate false measurements from temperature change, electrical noise, or mechanical deformation. In situations where measurements are inaccurate, it is possible the surgical robot will react in an unexpected and possibly unsafe manner. These types of problems present high risk scenarios where any undesirable motion of the surgical instrument controlled by a robot may cause severe injury or even a patient\u2019s death.\n\nHopkins researchers have developed novel features that improve a surgical robot\u2019s stability and safety. Because the efficiency and reliability of the primary force/torque sensor is critical to ensuring stringent control and safety requirements in surgical applications, the inventors focused on introducing additional force/torque sensors in different locations to mitigate complications stemming from the failure of one single primary sensor.\n\nSpecific to cooperative control of force/torque sensing, several new elements with a single interface were engineered into the robot\u2019s design. First, additional force/torque sensors act as a consistency check on the primary force/torque sensor and are used to cross-check the force and frequency values to determine if a failure has occurred. Second, in the event of robot arm collision, the motion, direction, force and contact point on the robot arm can be estimated. Third, operator interactions can be detected through frequency analysis to verify that the surgeon is properly holding an instrument (attached to the robot) without using a pedal or a button. Fourth, it provides improved stability and protection against user hand tremor.",

There is a need for precise delivery of intracanalicular implants at the appropriate depth in a safe and comfortable fashion for patients in the clinic. The inventors have proposed an integrated eyelid alignment platform that provide the end-user a means of delivering a canalicular implant in a precise location. This is accomplished by use of a mechanical retraction mechanism that removes the delivery catheter into the delivery device handle thereby deploying the canalicular implant.

To date, three drugs that inhibit polyADP-ribose polymerases (PARP) have been approved by the FDA to treat ovarian and other cancers. Though a promising new therapeutic target, enzyme families, including PARP, and the polynucleotides that they synthesize (i.e., polyADP-ribose [PAR]), remain understudied due to a woeful lack of investigational tools. In response, Johns Hopkins researchers have developed ELTA (Enzymatic Labeling of Terminal ADP-ribose) to label free or protein-conjugated ADP-ribose monomer and polymers. This new investigational tool will allow for researchers to better understand these polynucleotides and their role in a variety of diseases. ELTA can serve as a research platform that allows the application of research techniques commonly used in the study of RNA and DNA to the study of PAR. For example, ELTA can fluorescently label PAR for biophysical measurement, radiolabel isolated PAR for the assessment of polymer length, and enrich ADP-ribosylated substrate for identification via mass spectrometry. While PAR radio and fluorescent labelling is currently possible, it requires chemical methods for PAR synthesis and conjugation that most molecular and cellular biology labs do not have access to. Similarly, ELTA can assess polymer length with only trace amounts of labeled PAR polymers compared to the current methods that requires large quantities of PAR polymers that are outside the reach of most academic laboratories. Finally, ELTA method is straightforward, highly efficient and can be complete within 1-2 hours. In this way, ELTA is a flexible research tool that will allow for labs to more effectively study this polynucleotide-like protein modification. While already shown to be an effective method for investigating PAR, researchers are investigating further applications of ELTA. Besides protein-conjugated ADP-ribose, studies in prokaryotes and eukaryotes have revealed several ADP-ribose derivatives, including O-acetyl-ADP-ribose by the sirtuin deacetylase family, ADP-ribose-1\u2019\u2019-phosphate from tRNA splicing, ADP-ribosylation of the antibiotics rifamycin, as well as the recently discovered DNA ADP-ribosylation. ELTA may, therefore, provide a timely tool for discovering the functions of these various forms of ADP-ribosylation in antibiotic resistance, as well as NAD+, RNA and DNA metabolism.",

Technology has developed recently where active micro gas sensors are becoming smaller, lower cost, more efficient, and more accurate to allow for more applications in the chemical process, automobiles, life sciences, environmental protection, and public health industries. Currently, there are two main classes of micro gas sensors: highly selective materials that are sensitive to only one gas and materials which can detect multiple gases but cannot differentiate the gases. There is an unmet need for affordable gas detection technology that is both highly selective and sensitive to only one gas in order able to give an accurate reading despite interference from volatile contaminates in the surrounding air. Johns Hopkins researches have developed sensors which use ratiometric analysis to improve the selectivity and sensitivity of gas detections by measuring the response of multiple organic field transistors (OFETs) of different compositions. Most importantly, this technology allows for the differentiation of gases and contaminates. The technology is a platform for the emergence of OFETS into the market. Currently the market is dominated by metal oxide field effect transistors (MOS FETS); however, the relative ease of chemically functionalizing OFET materials makes it highly desirable and compatible with the ratiometric analysis technique. A device can be designed with multiple OFETS that have been chemically modified to have radically different responses to different gases. This device can identify and differentiate gases and their relative concentrations. This raises the performance OFETs closer to MOS FETs while providing the added benefits of organic electronics such as low manufacturing cost, reduced weight, low power requirements, and flexibility.",

Current monitoring systems often lack the ability to distinguish low concentrations of air hazards in the presence of overwhelming vapors. Water vapor (humidity) is a particularly common high concentration interferent. In cases where industrial or vehicular emissions are prevalent, organic vapors can also be high concentration interferents.

Thus, there is a need for an ocular bandage with healing capabilities that is high in transparency and strength.\n\nJohns Hopkins University researchers have optimized the transparency, strength, and healing potential of a cellulose-based material for use in corneal wound healing. The material is cost-effective, promotes cell growth, and is biocompatible. Furthermore, the optical, biomechanical, and biological properties represent an improvement over current technologies and therefore the invention has great potential to be used as a therapeutic drug-releasing eye patch for corneal repair following injury/surgery.\n\nThe technology has been prototyped and characterized in terms of optical transparency, heat flow, and biomechanical properties.",

    "ip_description": "Due to eye injuries and ocular diseases such as keratitis and keratoconus, nearly 5 million patients in the world suffer from corneal blindness. The cornea is a transparent multilayered tissue of the eye that consists of epithelial and endothelial layers and helps focus the light on the retina. However, injuries to the cornea can cause corneal scarring which results in a haze that impairs vision. There is a limited availability of donor corneas especially in developing regions of Asia and Africa which translates to a low percentage of individuals that can receive treatment. Current standards of care include donor corneas and synthetic corneas. Donor corneas, which are considered the best corneal replacement, have issues with availability, storage, and distribution. Synthetic corneas can successfully correct for refractive properties of the damaged corneas; however, because they are synthetic polymer based, they do not support tissue remodeling or integration into the patient\u2019s body which can lead to complications. There is a need to develop synthetic alternatives that supports tissue remodeling and replicates the physical properties of a native healthy cornea. Researchers at Hopkins have developed a corneal mimetic structure. Normal corneas contain high amounts of proteoglycans, which play a critical role in corneal transparency by regulating the collagen fiber diameter and spacing. However, it is difficult to derive a large amount of purified proteoglycans. In its place, investigators substituted cyclodextrins, circular sugar molecules that are easy to synthesis and are routinely used in other biological applications. The cyclodextrin-collagen matrix forms a thick, transparent and mechanically strong collagen-based composition. This biocomposition mimics the multilayered structure of the cornea, with different layers promoting different biological properties. It also supports tissue remodeling that synthetic corneas are unable to do, making this invention a practical and functional alternative for corneal regeneration. This synthetic biocomposition also addresses issues of limited availability of donor corneas. Results from a rabbit model demonstrate cyclodextrin-collagen implants can serve as corneal substitutes with high transparency, ease of suturability and biomimetic ultrastructure.",

Further, the gene expression level is slightly reduced in patients with COPD and in the mouse model exposed to chronic cigarette smoke.

More than 95% of cases and deaths due to TB are found in developing countries with India, Indonesia, China, Pakistan and South Africa accounting for 60% of global TB cases. TB is an airborne disease that can be easily spread from person to person. The market for tuberculosis is expected to reach $863.9 million by 2022 with a CAGR of 8%. Current treatments last 6-9 weeks and the main anti-TB therapeutic agent is isoniazid (INH). Despite its prevalence, there is limited understanding of the improvements of INH. The proposed invention uses isotopically labeled derivatives of INH, ethionamide and related compounds as effective therapy for the treatment of mycrobacterial disease, including mycobacterium tuberculosis. It has been demonstrated that peroxidative activation of INH by mycobacterial enzyme KateG generates reactive species that forms adducts with NAD and NADP. This causes antibiotic action against TB. The inventors have discovered the precise reaction mechanism to form these adducts that could improve the effectiveness of INH. The proposed technology offers substitutions to alter the stability of INH acyl radical, upon anti-TB activity. The inventor suggests a heavy oxygen isotope and hydrazide substation at the acyl group of INH. These changes could in INH could be developed into highly potent drugs for TB. The role of hydrazide group substitution has been tested. The compounds demonstrate better activity in INH in an MIC assay in vitro.",

These percentages also correspond to the proportion of cases with the poorest clinical and pathological outcomes. When mutations in either of these oncogenes alone are present, only a modest effect is observed. However, when promoter mutations are found in both oncogenes, more aggressive disease phenotypes, tumor development/recurrence, and increased mortality result. The underlying mechanism cooperatively linking these two oncogenes is unknown. Determining the molecular mechanism would have important cancer biological and clinical implications and would reveal new options to improve treatment for more aggressive forms of cancer. Johns Hopkins researchers have identified a novel molecular mechanism that describes the synergetic relationship between the promoter mutations of the oncogenes, BRAF V600E and TERT, in which the GAPBPB transcription factor, FOS, functionally bridges the two. This mechanism explains how these oncogenes cooperatively promote aggressive cancer behavior, tumor development, and disease specific mortality. The inventors have identified a novel molecular mechanism that explains the recently observed robust role of the genetic duet of BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations in cooperatively promoting the aggressiveness and poor clinical outcomes of several human cancers, thus exposing important cancer biological and clinical implications for aggressive melanoma, PTC, and other cancers.",

    "ip_description": "Biodegradable nanoparticle composition with core-shell structure. Controllable nanoparticle size with low polydispersity index. Wide range for protein loading level. Nanoparticles capable of sustained released over period of 2 weeks to 3 months. Protein therapeutics are used for a variety of medical treatments, such as cancer, infectious disease, hemophilia, anima, etc. Therapeutic proteins support targeted therapeutic processes by compensating the deficiency of an essential protein. To successfully administer protein therapeutics, the delivery system must consist of biodegradability, a high loading capacity, controlled/sustained long-term releases, and scalable production. Many therapeutic proteins have short biological half-lives and are difficult to deliver to the target site. Two types of delivery systems, hydrogel and nano/micro particles prepared by poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), are often used, however they do not offer sustained long-term release or controlled release concentration, respectively. Thus, there is a need for sustained release of protein therapeutics through a scalable and reproducible method. Inventors at Johns Hopkins have a developed a continuous and scalable method to prepare biodegradable nanoparticles with core-shell structures, and high payload capacity for the delivery of protein/antibody therapeutics. The invention describes the preparation of nanoparticles with encapsulated polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC) of proteins/antibodies and counter ion polymers. By complexing protein therapeutics into PEC nanoparticles with polyelectrolytes carrying the opposite charge, the resultant PEC nanoparticles are coated to form core-shell nanoparticles. These core-shell nanoparticles enable a sustained and prolonged release of proteins. The release rate can be adjusted by manipulating the weight ratio of protein to polymer or choosing different di-block copolymers. This technology allows spatiotemporally-controlled release of nanoparticles for various protein therapeutics, including antibody pharmaceutics. Using these techniques, protein delivery nanoparticle devices can improve delivery efficiency and pharmaceutical properties. The inventors have tested this method with nanoparticles NP9, NP9, NP10 and NP11, and determined the zeta potentials and encapsulation of efficiencies. The results indicate that the release profile of the system could be modified through different degradation rates and polymers.",

It is estimated to affect 1 in 4000 people worldwide, with approximately 100,000 cases in the United States. Symptoms begin in childhood with a loss of night vision, and eventually RP leads to significant vision loss and blindness in adulthood. Presently, RP has no cure or effective treatment. Life-style modifications and disability services can improve quality of life and retinal implants are available for those with profound disease. Consequently, there is a great need for novel neuroprotective therapeutics to treat RP and preserve rod photoreceptor cells throughout a patient\u2019s life. Johns Hopkins researchers have demonstrated novel repurposing of certain human approved drugs as neuroprotective compounds for the treatment of RP. The compounds were identified through a large-scale phenotypic screen in a zebrafish model of RP. Top hits from the screen in zebra fish that preserved rod photoreceptor cell survival were validated using mouse photoreceptor cell culture and retinal explant cultures from the retinal degeneration 1 (rd1) RP mouse model. Combinatorial assays also identified 7 additive compounds that target complimentary neuroprotective signaling pathways that offer additional treatment strategies for RP. The inventors have identified novel neuroprotective functions for four human approved therapeutics that can potentially be used to treat RP. Further research will be conducted to measure efficacy in preserving rod photoreceptor cell survival in humans and to optimize safe and effective dosing and extended release formulas for the human retina.",

Despite these efforts, additional mechanisms of resistance to EGFR blockade are thought to be present in colorectal cancer and little is known about determinants of sensitivity to this therapy. Johns Hopkins researchers examined the effect of somatic genetic changes in colorectal cancer on sensitivity to a common targeted therapy, by performing complete exome sequence and copy number analyses of 129 tumors that were KRAS wild-type and analyzed their response to anti-EGFR antibody blockade in patient-derived tumorgraft models and 55 patient tumors. The genomic analyses identified novel candidate mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance through alterations affecting EGFR, its downstream signaling pathway, and other cell surface receptors, as well as all previously known mechanisms of resistance in CRC. The inventors evaluated the role of the novel alterations identified by performing functional assays in a cetuximab-sensitive CRC cell line.

TB is one of the world\u2019s deadliest diseases; one-fourth of the global population is currently infected with TB. In 2016 alone, 10.4 million people contracted TB with 1.7 million TB-related deaths. Lack of resources in developing and poor countries is one of the main reasons for high mortality rates in TB patients.\n\nSince \u2018standard of care\u2019 diagnostic tests rely on serial sputum samples which require multiple patient visits and expensive equipment not necessarily available at point-of-care healthcare settings it is quite challenging for patients to receive an accurate diagnosis (most TB infections are latent and asymptomatic) and subsequent treatment. As such, there is a significant need for new diagnostic technologies that are inexpensive, time-efficient, highly selective and sensitive for M. tuberculosis, and reasonable for point-of-care use in resource-poor clinics.\n\nJohns Hopkins researchers have developed a molecular method towards development of point-of-care diagnosis of TB. The method detects a specific enzyme unique to M. tuberculosis which is absent in non-tubercular mycobacteria. The enzyme is detected in M. tuberculosis culture via a colorimetric assay based on the hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate. The molecular method is highly specific for the detection of M. tuberculosis as low as 6.5x103 CFU/ml, demonstrating diagnostic accuracy greater than methods used in resource-poor healthcare facilities.

In the United States 81,190 patients will be diagnosed in 2018 and 17,240 will die from their disease. The first-line treatment of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is the transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT), followed by the intravesical administration of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG). However, 50% of patients will not respond to BCG therapy and often require the use of conventional chemotherapy delivered intravesically through a catheter. Systemic cisplatin (CDDP)-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for advanced or metastatic bladder cancer. Yet, when conventional CDDP is delivered intravesically, it has toxic side effects and its efficacy is limited by its low penetration of bladder tissue. Consequently, localized, intravesical administration of novel CDDP formulations may have improved efficacy and tolerability compared to systemic administration.\n\nTechnology Overview: The inventors have developed a nanoparticle-based CDDP therapy that enhances CDDP\u2019s retention in the bladder.

When this occurs, patients experience a high increase in pain and limited range of motion in their joint. HO can be caused by trauma to the hip or leg and even when patients have experienced traumatic brain or spinal cord injuries. There have been no effective protocols for the treatment or prevention of HO, but some people will undergo radiation therapy, anti-inflammatory agents, or surgery. While some of these therapies are successful in inhibiting inflammation, the therapeutic window is before clinical recognition by radiography, and surgical procedures have high recurrence rate and frequent complications. With limited knowledge of HO and no effective therapy, there is a need for a reliable method to treat HO. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have discovered that excess activation of the coupling factor TGF-\u03b2 for bone remodeling drives the progression of HO. By systemic injections of TGF-\u03b2 neutralizing antibodies, HO progression is weakened. During HO progression, Nestlin lineage cells develops H-type vessels. Using the TGF-\u03b2 antibody treatment, the Nestin+ cells were inhibited and H-type vessel formation was limited. By further targeting TGF-\u03b2 signaling, HO progression can be hindered.",

    "ip_description": "Anastasis, Greek for \"rising to life\", is a newly discovered cell recovery phenomenon by which a cell undergoes reversal of apoptosis or programmed cell death. Research has shown that even cells that exhibit the hallmarks of late-stage cell death such as activation of executioner caspases are able to undergo anastasis. Anastasis can be a mechanism of tumorigenesis and recurrence, mediating cancer cell survival during treatment. Conversely, anastasis may also mitigate tissue damage by protecting cells that would be difficult to recover, such as cardiomyocytes, neurons and photoreceptor cells. Therefore, suppression and activation of anastasis could be critical therapeutic targets in cancer and regenerative medicine, respectively. Being able to track cells after they have undergone anastasis is critical to the development of therapeutics that either activate or suppress this survival mechanism. However, it is technically challenging to detect and track anastasis in vivo because the cells that have reversed the cell death process can be morphologically indistinguishable from normal healthy cells. The primary method of tracking anastasis in vivo is labelling cells with activated (cleaved) caspases using immunostaining or caspase biosensors. However, activated caspases and these current cleavage-activated biosensors are degraded shortly after anastasis, making these methods unable to track the fate of cells, especially in long term, once the cells have recovered from cell death process. The inventors have developed a novel caspase biosensor, the mammalian version of in vivo CaspaseTracker biosensor, which is able to permanently label cells undergoing anastasis, enabling the long-term track of the fate of anastatic cells in live animals. Importantly, this invention could be used for drug screening of intractable diseases mediated by anastasis with patient-derived xenografts and patient-derived tumor organoids. The CaspaseTracker biosensor is also able to detect and track non-apoptotic caspase activity, which plays potential roles in diverse normal cell functions, such as regulation of neuronal activity, learning and memory, spermatid individualization, microRNA processing, cell proliferation, and cell fate patterning. Therefore, this CaspaseTracker biosensor can also facilitate these studies in vivo.

They account for many millions of visits to physicians and therapists every year, and often produce prolonged physical and psychological disability leading to a loss of economic productivity and a high risk of falls and injuries. Like many other neurological disorder (such as stroke or trauma) treatment depends on exercise regimens, which for vestibular disorders must stimulate the labyrinth to promote recovery. Unfortunately, these physical therapy programs commonly lack scientific rationale and evidence of effectiveness and include a frequency of activity with which many patients cannot comply. A new technology to study the scientific basis of how the brain uses its learning capabilities to recover and compensate from vestibular damage, and how to apply this technology to the treatment of vestibular disorders is desperately needed. We have recently shown that strong magnetic fields, such as those of an MRI machine, can stimulate the inner ear labyrinth for hours at a time while a subject comfortably lies in the machine. Following on this discovery, we are developing a versatile, strong magnetic field device, specifically to excite different parts of the inner ear labyrinth, comfortably, for long periods of time. Initial design studies demonstrate that such a device can be practically realized, and we are seeking partners to enable production of the first prototypes. This device will dramatically enhance the scientific study of mechanisms of recovery from vestibular disorders and be used to develop effective and practical physical therapy regimens for treatment of unsteadiness and impaired vision that are associated with disabling dizziness, vertigo and imbalance. Other potential uses are scientific, including, for example, studies of vestibular perception, visual vestibular interaction and control of posture; therapeutic, including treatment of cognitive disorders such as neglect and spatial disorientation; and even entertainment, combining vestibular and visual stimulation much as in an amusement park ride.",

Hopkins researchers developed a novel method for genome editing in mammalian cells that uses linear donor DNAs to introduce precise edits in the genome. Data demonstrated that PCR fragments containing edits up to 1kb require only 35bp homology arms to initiate repair of Cas9-induced double-strand breaks in human cells and mouse embryos. Furthermore, researchers experimentally determined donor DNA design rules that maximize the recovery of edits without cloning or selection. These findings enable rational design of synthetic donor DNAs for efficient genome editing.

    "ip_number": "C14998",
    "published_date": "2/5/2018",
    "ip_description": "This diagnostic technology uses a panel of 20 biomarkers to diagnose Lyme disease with much higher sensitivity and accuracy than other currently existing methods. Lyme disease can be detected in peripheral blood samples from patients even at early hard-to-diagnose stages. These aspects of the invention make it indispensable for speeding up recovery and prevention of complications associated with this debilitating illness such as carditis, arthritis, neurological illness and even death. Lyme disease \u2013 a systemic tick-borne bacterial infection, is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States and Europe. Disease prevalence estimates remain inaccurate primarily due to the lack of sensitive diagnostic tests. Current diagnostic tools for detecting nucleic acid or antibody responses from Borrelia burgdorferi infection have low assay sensitivity. The inability to detect the early acute phase of infection delays treatment and complete recovery for many patients. This diagnostic technology uses a novel gene expression classifier that allows for early detection of Lyme disease with high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. UCSF scientists used whole transcriptome data from 41 clinically diagnosed Lyme disease samples compared with 12 samples from other infections and 19 healthy controls, followed by iterative targeted RNA resequencing in conjunction with machine learning algorithms on a total of 220 unique samples. They identified a panel of 20 genes that accurately discriminated Lyme patients from healthy controls and patients with viral and other bacterial infections. This Lyme disease diagnostic exhibits 82% sensitivity in disease detection and is able to discriminate from other viral or bacterial infections with 91% specificity and 87% accuracy. Transcriptome profiling by next-generation sequencing is a promising approach to identify diagnostic host biomarkers in response to infection and the improved performance of this method makes it particularly suitable for clinical diagnosis of acute Lyme disease.",

    "ip_description": "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) are a growing threat with significant economic ramifications. In particular, TB is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, with an estimated 10.4 million people infected, globally. An estimated 1.8 million deaths are attributable to TB. MDR-TB is TB that does not respond to the 2 most powerful anti-TB drugs, and approximately 500,000 people developed MDR-TB in 2015. Globally, only 52% of MDR-TB patients are successfully treated, demanding new approaches to combating this pathogen. This specific case is part of a larger and growing trend of antibiotic resistance that will require new combative strategies. One such strategy is combining common antibiotics with additional compounds that increase and/or restore the susceptibility of resistant bacteria to current therapeutics. Without a way to restore this susceptibility, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for carbapenems to successfully treat MDR pathogens are neither safe nor tolerated in infected individuals. This invention provides a way to begin developing such a restorative regimen. The inventors have found that a combination of the carbapenem class of antibiotics and avibactam (a beta-lactamase inhibitor) IS POTENT AGAINST Mycobacterium absessus and potentially against other pathogenic bacteria. This discovery presents a unique opportunity to develop a regimen to treat MDR bacterial infections. Notably, a combination of tebipenem, ertapenem, or panipenem with avibactam presented the greatest shift in MIC, indicating that Avibactam restores MICs of carbapenem-class antibiotics against M. abscessus to therapeutically achievable concentrations of the drugs.",

    "ip_description": "Creating artificial vesicular systems that can mimic natural cells continues to be a challenge in the fields of synthetic biology as well as gene and drug delivery. This class of artificial systems serve as a powerful platform for both studying biology in a minimal, controlled system and moreover can be used as biocompatible vehicles to deliver various biological and chemical materials in a cellular environment. Currently, giant vesicles can be fabricated with geometry, membrane lamellarity, and lipid compositions to mimic real cells; however, encapsulating biological materials inside these vesicles has proven difficult. This invention allows for the biocompatible encapsulation and cellular delivery of biological materials under physiologically relevant conditions. This is especially paramount in the burgeoning field of genome editing as this vesicular platform can be used to encapsulate a relatively high concentration of both protein (e.g. Cas9) and nucleotide (e.g. guide RNA) material in these vesicles. This platform is especially effective in applications where the biomaterial of choice does not have high water solubility which is the case for most chemical therapeutics or where targeted delivery in high doses is desired. Johns Hopkins researchers found that biological material (e.g., purified proteins, DNA material, and cell lysates) can be reliably encapsulated in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). GUVs are cell-sized model membrane systems, which can be fabricated with different lipid compositions, in sizes ranging from 10 to 100 microns in diameter under physiologically relevant pH, buffer, and temperature conditions. Hopkins researchers invented a methodology to include proteins and cell lysates into a GUV embodiment given the physiologically-relevant platform. This unique method of encapsulation allows for anchoring of membrane-bound proteins to the inner vesicular lipid leaflet and loading of cytosolic proteins in its lumen. Moreover, these vesicles proved permeable with respect to small drug compounds such as rapamycin. The technology allows for deeper studies of cellular signaling as well as transient delivery of cytosolic and membrane-bound proteins for applications such as localized delivery of drugs or genome editing constituents such as Cas9 protein and the desired guide RNA. Additionally, these fabricated GUVs are biocompatible and have great potential as a biologic drug delivery platform not limited by surface interacting proteins.",

    "ip_description": "Corneal lacerations are a common type of eye injury. These can occur in varying degrees of severity, and in many cases the wound is non-self-sealing. This type of injury requires significant intervention including sutures and, in some cases, many layers of grafts. During the course of treatment patients are required to wear bandages that can obstruct vision and prevent an injured individual from completing essential tasks. Thus, there is a need for an ocular bandage with healing capabilities that is high in transparency and strength. Johns Hopkins University researchers have optimized the transparency, strength, and healing potential of a cellulose-based material for use in corneal wound healing. The material is cost-effective, promotes cell growth, and is biocompatible. Furthermore, the optical, biomechanical, and biological properties represent an improvement over current technologies and therefore the invention has great potential to be used as a therapeutic drug-releasing eye patch for corneal repair following injury/surgery. The technology has been prototyped and characterized in terms of optical transparency, heat flow, and biomechanical properties.",

    "ip_description": "Over half of sports injuries involve tendons and entheses (the sites of attachment between ligament and bone). Enthesopathy, a disorder involving the attachment of tendon or ligament, represents one-fourth of tendon diseases and is a difficult disorder to treat. Tendon disorders, which include enthesopathy, represent a considerable socioeconomic burden, with an estimated annual cost in healthcare and indirect loss of wages of $850 billion. Despite its high prevalence, the cell signaling mechanisms that contribute to its pathogenesis remains unknown. Consequently, there are no disease-modifying therapies at present for enthesopathy and orthopedic surgery is the only treatment option. Johns Hopkins researchers have generated two independent mouse models of enthesopathy pathogenesis: a semi-Achilles tendon transection model (SMTS) and a dorsiflexion immobilization model (DI). The role of TGF-\u03b2 in musculoskeletal disease has drawn increasing attention in recent years, where activated TGF-\u03b2 has been shown to recruit mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) to maintain tissue homeostasis. The researchers have shown that TGF-\u00df was activated in tendon-bone insertions in both the SMTS and DI models. Their work suggests that inhibition of elevated levels of active TGF-\u00df could serve as potential therapy. The inventors have generated two mouse models that reproduce enthesopathy pathogenesis. The researchers have shown that high concentrations of active TGF-\u00df in these models led to excessive vessel formation, bone deterioration and fibrocartilage calcification, thereby contributing to enthesopathy. Conversely, treatment of the SMTS mice with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against TGF-\u03b2 (1D11) attenuated the enthesopathy pathology compared to mice injected with a vehicle antibody. These models may provide valuable tools for screening potential therapeutics targeting the TGF-\u00df pathway involved in enthesopathy.",

New generation of anti-depressants based on most recent biomedical discoveries concerning depression are urgently needed. Johns Hopkins researchers have identified novel function of Gadd45b in regulating chromatin and epigenetic DNA methylation levels of promoters for specific types of neuronal genes, including those essential for neuronal plasticity and cell survival. Gadd45b is a member of a family of proteins with roles in modulating cell response to both genotoxic stress and physiological stress. Few of the key Gadd45b-dependent targets include BDNF and FGF. The researchers further found that effects of antidepressant methods (such as electroconvulsive treatment or voluntary exercise) in adult hippocampus are due to Gadd45b up-regulation in neurons. The most effective anti-depressant electroconvulsive treatment induces a robust expression of Gadd45b. Augmentation of Gadd45b and its associated pathways can potentially be used as a novel means to modulate cellular epigenetic status and for treating depression and anxiety as well as enhancing learning and memory.",

Cre mediated recombination was then used to remove the neo cassette leaving exons 2 and 3 floxed (Molecular Image Detail). Myostatin (Mstn) and growth/differentiation factor 11 (Gdf11) play important roles in growth and differentiation. Mstn is predominantly expressed in developing and adult skeletal muscle, while Gdf11 allows differentiation between anterior and posterior (A/P) axial mesoderm identity. In a study to determine whether myostatin and Gdf11 are functionally redundant with respect to control of muscle mass, GDF11 flox mice were generated since the increase in muscle mass in Mstn-/- mice is not present at birth, and GDF11-/- and Mstn-/- GDF11-/- mice die within 24 hours of birth, precluding the direct comparison of the skeletal muscle phenotype. JHU researchers generated a targeting construct containing a conditional deletion allele of the Gdf11 gene by inserting loxP recombination sites into intron 1 and flanking a neo gene downstream of the Gdf11 3' UTR (Gdf11flox-neo). Following homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells and injection of the targeted cells into blastocysts, chimeric mice were obtained that transmitted the Gdf11flox-neo allele through the germline. Mice carrying the Gdf11flox-neo allele were then crossed to EIIa-Cre transgenic mice to generate Gdf11flox/+ mice carrying one upstream and one downstream loxP site after removal of the neo gene. Recombination at the remaining loxP sites delete exons 2 and 3 (Gdf11\uf0c42\u20133), making a functional null by removing the biologically-active carboxy-terminal domain. JHU researchers crossed double heterozygous mice (Mstn +/- Gdf11+/-) to produce Mstn-/- Gdf11-/- and compared the thoracic and lumbar vertebras to examine skeletal development. It was observed that without Mstn, there was an increase in severity of the Gdf11 null phenotype throughout the axis. This demonstrated the myostatin and Gdf11 exhibit similar roles and either one could be addressed in skeletal development. To prove the mystatin effect on muscle mass, Mstn+/+ mice and Mstn-/- mice were examined. Mstn-/- mice had four times the muscle mass than Mstn +/+. Researchers then studied Gdf11 mutations and its effect on muscle mass. Between six different mutations in Gdf11, there was no difference in body weight or muscle mass. Based on the results, myostatin and Gdf11 have redundant functions in regulating skeletal development, and patterning, but not muscle size. This suggests that the either Mstn or Gdf11 can be targeted for skeletal development diseases, however, only Mstn can be used for muscle wasting.",

    "ip_description": "Physicians must determine whether patients with cystic tumors of the pancreas will be operated on or receive further imaging and monitoring. Biomarkers that can inform the physician of the state of progression of the tumor, as well as predict the neoplastic nature of the cyst, would be valuable for determining treatment course. Specifically, the authors would like to reduce the number of patients undergoing unneeded surgical resections, as this procedure has high morbidity. Market size can be inferred by the fact that up to 25% of the US population over the age of 70 likely harbors pancreatic cysts, which are rarely cancerous. Molecular diagnostics is expected to be a $45B industry by 2020, with the largest market share in the PCR field (27%) and the fastest growth in Oncology (CAGR 17%). Johns Hopkins researchers have developed a technology that capitalizes on the predisposition of cancer cells to contain critically short telomeres that tend to fuse end-to-end. Using a nested qPCR strategy, the researchers are able to detect the presence of these fused telomeres in the cyst fluid of patients with pancreatic cysts. The presence of cysts predicts with 100% specificity cancerous vs. non-cancerous samples, and is detected in 61% of cancer samples. In addition, telomere fusions could predict cancer severity: fusions were significantly more likely to be detected in cases of high grade dysplasia (27%) or associated invasive cancer (43%), compared with intermediate-grade dysplasia (15%) or low-grade dysplasia (0%). This technique has been validated in 91 patients who underwent pancreatic surgical resection.",
