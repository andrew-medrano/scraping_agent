    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Antisense oligonucleotide technology to reduce pathogenic inflammation. Targets RNA splicing to degrade harmful NLRP3 protein production. May treat autoimmune diseases, sepsis, chronic inflammatory conditions. Chronic inflammatory diseases, such as CAPS (Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes), are often driven by gain-of-function mutations in the NLRP3 gene that result in excessive inflammation. Historically, treatments aim to manage symptoms rather than targeting the underlying cause. Traditional anti-inflammatory drugs can have broad systemic effects and may not adequately address the dysregulated protein production. With no cure available for CAPS and similar inflammatory conditions, the need for a targeted, efficient therapeutic approach to directly reduce the production of the harmful NLRP3 protein is urgent. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) provide a promising strategy by specifically targeting RNA transcripts to prevent the synthesis of dysfunctional proteins. Researchers have developed a modified antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to induce aberrant splicing of exon 2 of the NLRP3 RNA transcript. This intervention disrupts the open reading frame, introducing a premature termination codon, leading to the production of an unstable, non-functional mRNA. Consequently, the amount of functional NLRP3 protein is significantly reduced. In mouse models of CAPS disease, this ASO approach has shown therapeutic efficacy in reducing disease severity. Furthermore, it has demonstrated the potential to decrease inflammatory responses in sepsis models. Real-world applications include the treatment of autoimmune diseases like CAPS, sepsis, and other conditions characterized by chronic inflammation, offering a targeted solution to mitigating excessive inflammatory responses.",

    "ip_description": "Digital journaling app for accurate mental health symptom tracking. Replaces incomplete, time-consuming retrospective reports with automated summaries. Applies to mental health diagnosis, treatment tracking, clinical session optimization. In psychiatric practice, clinicians rely heavily on patient retrospective reports to understand symptoms and environmental stressors over the past month. This method is nearly universal but has significant drawbacks: it is often incomplete and inaccurate, and the process of gathering this information is time-consuming, frequently consuming most of the clinical session. These inefficiencies can lead to misdiagnosis or suboptimal treatment plans. Given the rising demand for mental health services, there is a growing need for more accurate and efficient ways to track patient symptoms and experiences. An improved method could enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize clinical time, and ultimately lead to better patient outcomes.

    "ip_description": "New oral inulin-gel formulation for food allergy immunotherapy. Enhanced safety and potential broader application compared to existing OITs. Useful for treating peanut allergies, potential adaptation for other food allergens. Food allergies have become more prevalent and severe in the U.S. and other Western countries. Traditionally, such allergies have been challenging to manage due to the unpredictable nature of allergic reactions, which can be severe even with minute allergen exposure. Existing methods, like Oral Immunotherapy (OIT) using FDA-approved products such as Palforzia\u2122 for peanut allergy, do help but come with limitations. Palforzia, a defatted peanut flour powder, is taken daily mixed in food; however, there is a significant risk of anaphylaxis, and only around 70% of patients respond favorably. Additionally, patients must continue to avoid peanuts in their diet. Other approaches, like epicutaneous immunotherapy, have shown limited efficacy. Consequently, there's a pressing need for improved, safer, long-term therapies for peanut and other food allergies. Researchers have created an oral inulin-gel formulation that presents promising advancements in food allergy immunotherapy. Inulin, a dietary natural fiber, is leveraged to create a new form of oral gel containing peanut extract. Remarkably, this inulin-gel formulation, when administered to mice, provided significant protection against peanut allergen challenges, effectively preventing signs of anaphylactic shock, bodyweight loss, and temperature drop. Preliminary data indicate that this inulin-gel modulates the gut microbiome to promote regulatory T cells, which are vital for immune tolerance. This formulation could be adapted to other food allergens and possibly extended to treating autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and type-1 diabetes.",

Enhances fluorescent signals and measures multiple dyes without photonic band gap inhibition. Applications include biomolecular interaction assays, ultrasound detection, kinetic analysis, and refractive index measurement. Photonic crystals are optical nanostructures with periodic dielectric properties that can control the propagation of light, making them ideal for various photonic devices and sensors. Traditional detection systems, such as surface plasma resonance (SPR), have been widely used for real-time, label-free measurements. However, SPR systems have notable limitations, including poor sensitivity to small analytes (around 1000 Da) and mass transport constraints. These shortcomings necessitate the development of more sensitive and versatile detection technologies. Enhanced signal detection without band gap inhibition is valuable in applications requiring high-throughput and measurement of biomolecular interactions, such as drug discovery, biological research, and diagnostic testing. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a novel detection system utilizing a photonic crystal in a total internal reflection geometry (PC-TIR). This innovative design significantly improves the sensitivity and stability of fluorescent signal detection, achieving a 20-fold enhancement compared to non-photonic crystal structures. The PC-TIR sensor allows real-time, label-free quantitative analysis of samples, avoiding the mass transport limitations common in SPR systems. Additionally, this setup facilitates the measurement of multiple fluorescent dyes over a wide wavelength range without photonic band gap inhibition. The versatile and accessible interface of the PC-TIR sensor opens up a wide range of applications, including biomolecular interaction assays, ultrasonic detection, and kinetic analysis, offering a robust platform for advanced scientific and medical research.",

    "ip_description": "An improved gastroesophageal tamponade with enhanced insertion safety and usage efficiency. Features LED and color-coded ports for precise insertion and easier differentiation. Useful in emergency rooms, endoscopy units, and gastrointestinal surgery departments. Gastroesophageal tamponades are critical medical devices used to manage acute esophageal bleeding, commonly caused by varices. Historically, devices like the Minnesota Tube have been employed. These devices, while effective, possess distinct drawbacks, including complicated insertion processes and the risk of misplacement into the trachea instead of the esophagus, which can lead to fatal complications. Furthermore, the traditional designs have non-intuitive port configurations that can confuse healthcare providers, especially in emergency situations where time is of the essence. Consequently, there is a significant need for an advanced tamponade device that minimizes these complications, enhances efficiency, and ensures patient safety during the insertion process. Researchers have invented a form of gastroesophageal tamponade that significantly advances the traditional Minnesota Tube design by introducing an LED-equipped bougie for precise placement verification and color-coded ports for distinguishing between various functions. The LED light enables healthcare providers to verify that the device is correctly placed in the esophagus and not the trachea, thereby minimizing the risk of potentially fatal misplacements. The color-coded ports streamline the process of gastric and esophageal inflation and aspiration, reducing the likelihood of errors in fast-paced medical environments. This device is not only more user-friendly but also packaged as an all-in-one solution, complete with syringes for inflation. Potential real-world applications include emergency medical settings, intensive care units, and specialized gastrointestinal centers where rapid and accurate management of esophageal bleeds is critical.",

    "ip_description": "A novel, implantable conduit sleeve that joins broken or severed bone edges. It holds bone grafting materials and can deliver bone strengthening therapeutics. The sleeve is radiolucent to provide a clear radiographic evaluation of bone strengthening. Technological advances in recent years have improved the success of orthopedic implants and methods for bone reconstruction. Bone grafting is a surgical procedure that uses transplanted bone to repair and rebuild diseased or damaged bones. Still, surgical attempts to place bone grafts may be limited by a lack of sufficient autologous materials as well as morbidity at the donor site. Traditional bone grafting can be complicated by migration of the graft away from its intended site, complicating attempts to determine whether the goal to strengthen the intended payload site in the bone has been met. The evaluation of bone strengthening following bone grafting can also prove difficult to evaluate radiographically due to artifact from metal screws and plates. Various factors can lead to incomplete bone regrowth following surgical grafting, including muscle encroachment at the sight of concern. Conversely, an inappropriate overgrowth of healing bone may cause pain or functional deficits due to what is termed ectopic bone formation. So, a need exists for alternatives to bone grafting that can restore form and function of an injured bone. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a conduit sleeve for joining broken or severed bone edges which holds bone grafting materials in place and has the ability to deliver bone stimulating therapeutics to the sites of bone healing and regeneration. The conduit sleeve is a perforated tube comprised of implantable, irradiated, stretched thermoplastic material, which can be either resorbable or non-resorbable. The invention is made possible by combining an ultrasonic generator with a unique device which uniformly delivers localized heat and enables molding and annealing of the thermoplastic edges to bone under mechanical pressure. The device is available as a full sleeve, cuff, or wrap, and its surface can be manufactured with either a staggered hole or mesh wall arrangement. The material is radiolucent and therefore allows for clear visualization of the region of interest, maximizing accurate bone density measurements. This technology therefore improves upon several variables present when researching or surgically treating bone injuries.",

    "ip_description": "Evidence for soluble urokinase plasminogen activator (suPAR) involvement in atherosclerosis. Laboratory and murine model confirmation that suPAR leads to coronary artery disease. Provision of a target for treatment of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease (CAD) results from atherosclerosis and is associated with obesity, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and genetic susceptibility. Still, patients with similar risk factors for CAD show variability in their expression of the illness. Serum biomarkers aid in the delineation between those patients who experience clinical manifestations of CAD versus those who do not. Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a signaling glycoprotein that reflects inflammation and activation of the immune system, and which has been shown to predict atherosclerosis and heart disease. While suPAR has been shown to be a marker of CAD severity and aggressiveness, its causative role in atherosclerosis has not yet been determined. As such, a need exists for further research that clearly delineates the relationship between suPAR and CAD. Researchers at the University of Michigan have discovered evidence through genetic and experimental studies that soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) serves as a mediator of atherosclerotic disease. Evaluation by Mendelian randomization of variants in the plasminogen activator urokinase receptor (PLAUR) gene that codes for suPAR shows its role in coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. Mouse models of atherosclerosis confirm that over-expression of suPAR leads to an increase in atherosclerosis and changes in the heart muscle that are most likely to rupture and cause myocardial infarction. Conversely, mice whose suPAR expression is inactivated have no increase in atherosclerosis. This invention therefore shows a method for preventing or treating atherosclerosis by targeting suPAR through mechanisms such as the delivery of monoclonal antibodies, extraction of suPAR through apheresis, or through the use of newly developed oral medications.",

    "ip_description": "Novel biomarkers that predict risks for toxicity in patients undergoing CAR-T cancer treatments. Serum evaluations of neutrophil counts as well as two specific proteins define side effect risks. Continuous temperature monitoring of CAR-T patients heralds upcoming side effect events. Effective adoptive T cell therapy involves the targeting of cancer cells through the use of transferred T cells, with the main approach being chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy. CAR-T involves recovery of T cells from a cancer patient\u2019s blood, genetically modifying the gene for the specific chimeric antigen receptor, and then placing them back into the patient where the newly developed CAR-T cells bind to target cell surface antigens. CAR-T therapies are being developed for a wide range of cancer types, and they have shown particular usefulness in heavily treated, relapsed patients with acute leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. A major limiting factor for CAR-T therapy is toxicity due to over-activation of the host's innate immune system which occurs in over 70% of treated patients and causes ICU admission in up to 30%. This side effect profile limits which patients can be considered for CAR-T therapy, and it requires that all who receive treatment undergo a 2-week observation period to rule out the most serious unintended consequences of treatment. The two categories of deleterious effects include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). A small number of patients develop neurologic toxicity that causes their death. Given the absence of biomarkers or diagnostic tests to predict the onset of CRS or ICANS, a need exists to develop a method to accurately predict those at greatest risk of side effects from CAR-T therapy. Researchers from the University of Michigan have discovered promising candidate biomarkers for prediction of CRS and ICANS in patients undergoing CAR-T for cancer. Continuous serum evaluations of neutrophils as well as proteins named calprotectin and citrullinated histone 3 (Cit-H3) have been noted in patients more likely to suffer from CRS after CAR-T therapy. The discovery implicates neutrophil activation as a candidate mechanism for these underlying inflammatory syndromes, and it suggests that continuous temperature monitoring using a wearable sensor could herald the onset of CRS hours earlier than the current standard of care. Mathematical modeling of continuous temperature data could further optimize the analysis of risks for CRS and add an even longer lead time and more accurate portrayal of the risks faced by any individual patient. The use of this system could provide an inexpensive and reproducible means by which to provide timely medical interventions to CAR-T patients before side effects occur while alternatively offering a means to de-intensify surveillance for those who will not come to develop these types of toxicity.",

    "ip_description": "A nanomedicine that can combine with a chemotherapy agent to inhibit cancer growth. Remodels the immune microenvironment in both primary tumors and lymph nodes. Re-polarizes macrophages to a state that inhibits rather than promoting cancer growth. Breast cancer is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Twelve percent of women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of 90% that falls to 27% for patients with stage IV disease. There is no long-term cure for metastatic breast cancer, though treatments can prolong life. Many factors can promote the formation of cancer metastases, including the behavior of macrophages in primary tumors and lymph nodes. Macrophages can exist in two states, either exhibiting proinflammatory (M1) or immunosuppressive (M2) interactions with the surrounding microenvironment. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) located in the tumor site are usually the immunosuppressive (M2) phenotype, which encourages tumor growth and metastasis. The presence of these macrophages correlates with poor response to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Moreover, metastasis-associated macrophages (MAMs) may be found in lymph nodes and are also thought to contribute to cancer metastasis by preparing the premetastatic microenvironment associated with the M2 phenotype. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase is known to regulate the polarization of macrophages, and a need exists to further study this protein as a target for the development of novel therapeutics. Researchers have developed a nanomedicine of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor and the chemotherapy agent paclitaxel to remodel the immune microenvironment in both primary tumors and lymph nodes of patients with metastatic breast cancer. The goal is to combine these agents with Alpha-PD-1, an antibody directed toward a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on T cells, to provide a potential cure for metastatic breast cancer. The concurrent delivery of this nanomedicine with paclitaxel into the macrophages of primary tumors and their adjacent lymph nodes exhibited synergistic repolarization of macrophages from the M2 to the M1 state. This change in macrophage phenotype resulted in complete remission of metastatic breast cancer lesions in a mouse model. This treatment approach also leads to stimulation of long-term memory B cells in the bone marrow, blood, and spleen, suggesting the potential for complete remission or even cure in patients with metastatic breast cancer.",

Bile salts are naturally occurring surfactants that help solubilize lipids in the small intestine and regulate several hepatic, biliary, and intestinal functions. Preparations of bile acids and their salts have been proposed and employed as therapeutic agents for the local removal of undesired fat, and the market for agents that help manage unwanted fat deposits is vast. Body image disturbances are common and may be related to body dysmorphic disorder or depression, while fat contouring treatments have been shown to lead to improvements in mood and relationship stability. Liposuction has served as the most common approach for removal of undesired fat deposits, though its use may be limited due to invasiveness, expense, and prolonged recovery time. A noninvasive approach that employs injection of a bile salt solution has been utilized mainly for the removal of submental fat, though this therapy can cause inflammation and bruising at the injection site and requires multiple doses. A need therefore exists to discover a method to produce and administer a solubilized version of these drugs with an acceptable side effect profile. University of Michigan researchers have developed a means to utilize the presence of gold ions and water-soluble steroid-type drugs in an oil-water emulsion to enable the fabrication of bile salt microparticles. While particles of this nature have previously been made utilizing a gold nanoparticle template, this is the first methodology where controlled-release particles with regular geometries have been made using a gold ion to facilitate particle formation. The gold ions' reduction at the oil-water interface in a double emulsion solvent evaporation process enables a gold-bile salt interaction and the formation of bile salt particles. These composite drug particles have been shown to slowly degrade over time and release the active drug molecule, making them an effective controlled release drug delivery system. The inventors have illustrated the particles' ability to lyse adipocytes in vitro and in vivo with minimal side effects. Overall, particle-based delivery opens opportunities for localized delivery of these salts, improving efficacy while minimizing side effects associated with oral and existing subcutaneous medications. These particles have potential applications for a wide variety of ailments including dermatological ailments, immunological disorders, and various cancers.",

    "ip_description": "A novel, genetically encoded method to detect GPCR signaling, PPI, and protease cleavage events. Easily introduced into cell lines to produce high-throughput screening assays. Can be tuned to target specific components of cells for enhanced data collection. G-Protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), protein-protein interactions (PPI), and protease cleavage events are critical processes that help regulate human health. These cellular events can also play a role in the development of disease. In general, GPCRs are responsible for detecting extracellular chemicals and converting that detection signal into an intracellular response. G-protein activation results in the production of various secondary messengers, which ultimately help to regulate bodily functions. Cell signaling and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are therefore essential in living systems. Due to their importance, many tools have been developed to detect cell signaling events. Still, a need exists to improve genetically encoded methods to detect G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and protease cleavage events. Researchers at the University of Michigan have discovered a new sensor design motif that can be developed into fluorescent sensors for the detection of signaling molecules (agonists) for G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), protein-protein interactions (PPI), peptide-bond cleavage events, and a variety of other signaling events. This technology incorporates a circular-permuted fluorescent protein (cpFP) linked to a secondary protein that inhibits the cpFP's fluorophore maturation. When the secondary protein is removed from the cpFP as a result of a conformational change or peptide bond cleavage event, the fluorophore matures and fluoresces. The genetically encoded sensor motif can be easily introduced into cells, allowing for the creation of screening cell lines and high-throughput screening assays for drug development. This technology can also be tuned to target certain compartments of a cell, resulting in higher quality data collection. Collected data shows promising agonist detection capabilities for the mu-opioid receptor, kappa-opioid receptor, and beta-2 adrenergic receptor.

An obturator can be used to produce lips, eyelids, and structures of the nose, vagina, and anal sphincter, or it can maintain an opening thru internal tissue layers to provide stabilization. In the case of prelamination, the obturator fortifies tissue layers while maintaining an opening within the prelaminated flap, such as an aperture or stoma. Obturators formation can be customized to a specific need, or they can be manufactured in bulk for common procedures. Some of the most difficult obturators to create are those like lips which include a dynamic composite of mucosa, skin, and innervated skeletal muscles. A significant loss of lip tissue creates both functional and aesthetic concerns, affecting eating, drinking, talking, and social gesturing. A need therefore exists for improved strategies that repair complicated soft tissue defects resulting from trauma, tumor ablation, or congenital deformities. Inventors have created an obturator that permits formation of a prelaminated flap to produce preinnervated and prevascularized functional lips with muscle, skin, and mucosa. The prelamination phase involves a reconstructive process whereby a three-dimensional structure is built at a remote site by laminating different layers of tissue components as composite grafts. A coculture of oral and skin keratinocytes is seeded onto one dermal equivalent (DE) containing an intact basement membrane. A barrier is placed on the DE to prevent co-mingling of the two populations, permitting the cells to grow in a bioreactor as a normal stratified epithelium.

This approach allows the structure two weeks to mature before transferring the unit en bloc to the patient\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s area of defect, which has been maintained by the obturator.

    "ip_description": "Novel prevention and treatment of dry macular degeneration via pharmacologic activation of autophagy. Avoids direct inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its deleterious effects on RBE. An agent named flubendazole which reduces secretion of extracellular lipid-rich debris. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the developed world. The pathogenesis of AMD is heralded by the accumulation of extracellular and intracellular lipid-rich debris within and around the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). While the wet form of macular degeneration is characterized by fibrovascular scarring and can be prevented with anti-VEGF agents, the dry form of the disease affects 90% of AMD patients and does not have any known treatments. One potential treatment strategy involves the induction of autophagy, a conserved, intracellular catabolic, and degradative pathway which can clear the lipid-rich debris. However, inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is the major mechanism for inducing autophagy, can detrimentally alter core RPE functions. As such, a need exists for an alternative method to promote autophagy while sparing the RPE from any deleterious effects. Researchers have discovered a method for prevention and treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration through activation of autophagy without direct inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The researchers initially studied over thirty putative autophagy inducers that do not act via direct mTOR inhibition, testing for safety and efficacy in a primary human RPE culture model of AMD. The most promising compound, flubendazole (FLBZ), reduced the secretion of lipoprotein particles that generate extracellular lipid-rich debris termed drusen. FLBZ also reduced accumulation of intracellular debris called lipofuscin, while concurrently stimulating production of hydroxybutyrate which is used by photoreceptor cells as an energy source. And, in contrast to direct mTOR inhibitors, these compounds preserved RPE-specific functions such as tight-junction integrity and outer segment phagocytosis. In summary, the inventors have discovered that a means by which to induce RPE autophagy outside of mTOR inhibition may serve as a promising approach for prevention and treatment of dry AMD.",

A 31% absolute benefit in 90-day survival for appropriate patients treated with L-carnitine. Those with lower acetylcarnitine levels got no benefit and should be treated with a different approach. Sepsis is a clinical condition that occurs during an overwhelming infection and which causes a cascade of physiologic abnormalities including hyperlactatemia, hyperglycemia, lipolysis, and protein catabolism. The resulting inflammatory response can lead to septic shock, which portends a very poor prognosis with short-term mortality occurring in 40% of affected patients. In practice, sepsis remains the leading cause of death for patients in intensive care units. Several supportive interventions and treatments can be offered for patients suffering sepsis or septic shock, though the outcomes are often suboptimal. One treatment approach involves the delivery of L-carnitine with the goal of restoring metabolic balance. The results of studies evaluating the efficacy of L-carnitine in this setting have shown conflicting results. Though one recent trial did not show a significant reduction in mortality of sepsis patients after treatment with L-carnitine, there is a need to further evaluate subpopulations of the study group to determine whether there are categories of patients who might benefit from this approach. Researchers utilized a preplanned secondary analysis of serum samples from a clinical trial of sepsis patients to show that acetylcarnitine is the most viable candidate to predict a mortality benefit from the use of L-carnitine. Sepsis patients with acetylcarnitine levels >36 micromoles were less likely to die at 90 days if treated with L-carnitine. The results were statistically significant and revealed an improvement in survival from 69% to 100%. Conversely, sepsis patients acetylcarnitine levels <36 micromoles showed no benefit with L-carnitine treatment. The use of pretreatment acetylcarnitine concentration represents a clinical trial enrichment strategy that could be employed for a phase III L-carnitine efficacy study in patients with septic shock.",

Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems show advantages compared to their free drug counterparts including protection of loaded cargo from degradation or deactivation, controlled release mechanisms, and altered pharmacokinetics which permit specific control of biodistribution. However, nanoparticle use may be limited because of their rapid clearance from the circulation, inefficient delivery to target tissues, and a limited ability to cross anatomic blocks such as the blood brain barrier. The promise for nanoparticle-based therapeutics can only be met once these limitations are addressed. Researchers have prepared biodegradable Ovalbumin (OVA) protein nanoparticles comprised of at least one therapeutically active protein with a synthetic polymer crosslinker. The fabrication method involves cross-linking water-soluble proteins that yields structures with novel architecture. The process creates a mesh framework comprised of large, open pores within which therapeutic molecules can be loaded. The categories of molecules that can be loaded include therapeutics, biomolecules, enzymes, small molecules, and imaging agents. The release profile which facilitates delivery of these agents can be influenced by adjusting the size of the pores in the mesh.

However, traditional ELISA-based assays have a 4-6 hour turnaround time. While testing and therapeutic plans for cancers and other chronic diseases are formulated over days to weeks, a life-saving treatment for critically ill patients must be delivered in minutes to hours, requiring fast diagnostic technologies near the patient that traditional ELISA cannot offer. The ideal testing assay should be sensitive, have a low turnover time, include easy to follow protocols, enable high throughput, be able to multiplex, and show cost-effectiveness. Currently available tests and testing platforms, whether PCR- or ELISA-based, contain limitations in at least one or more of these areas. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a PEdELISA-based microarray that is a viable solution for rapid biomarker testing in critical care. This platform can test for multiple protein biomarkers in the same biofluid with a short (15-30 min) turnaround.

    "ip_description": "A novel definition of electrophysiological features of subthalamic sites. Associations between therapeutic tissue activation and electrophysiologic features. A predictive clinical tool to aid DBS programming and targeting for individual patients. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical therapy during which electric current is passed through electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nucleus to treat motor symptoms of Parkinson Disease (PD). This treatment is commonly given when first-line treatment with dopamine replacement therapy loses its efficacy. DBS may significantly improve the symptoms of Parkinson Disease like tremor, rigidity, and akinesia. The mechanism for relief of motor symptoms from Parkinson Disease involves activation of precise volumes of neural tissue. While electrophysiological and anatomical correlates of clinically effective electrode sites have been described, therapeutic stimulation likely acts through multiple distinct neural populations. Therefore, a need exists to characterize the full span of tissue activation and to define the neural signatures of therapeutic tissue activation volumes. Researchers at the University of Michigan have applied a data driven approach to a training set of electrophysiological features of subthalamic sites to identify associations between regions of therapeutic tissue activation and broadband electrophysiological features. The investigators defined wide variations in the distribution of that activation across the electrophysiologically defined subthalamic nucleus. This finding demonstrates the importance of personalized targeting and validates a set of electrophysiological signatures to predict therapeutic activation volumes. Tissue activation volumes (VTAs) may be defined using a predictive clinical tool to aid DBS programming and targeting for individual patients.

    "ip_description": "A novel test to determine whether a child is suffering from food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES). A sampling of white blood cells are incubated with food samples to detect an immune response. Permits the detection of FPIES without invasive testing or side effect risks. Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES) is an immune condition characterized by reactivity to one or more foods and which manifests early in life. The most common symptoms of FPIES include severe vomiting and diarrhea due to inflammation in the small intestine and colon. Foods that may trigger symptoms are milk, soy, and grains, although these causative exposures are variable and some children with severe cases can only tolerate one or two types of food. FPIES usually presents during infancy as solid foods are introduced into a child's diet, though most children outgrow the condition by the three to five years of age. Though the condition resolves with maturation, the associated malnutrition, failure to thrive, and psychological food aversions may have long lasting effects on afflicted children. FPIES differs from food allergies in that it does not produce food IgE antibodies and therefore cannot be diagnosed using currently available food allergy tests. This circumstance is therefore difficult to identify and is considered a diagnosis of exclusion once other potential causes of the symptoms are eliminated. Food sensitivities are isolated by first eliminating a particular food and then reintroducing it as a 'challenge' to evaluate reactions in the absence or presence of the suspect food. Oral food challenges unfortunately may trigger severe symptoms, and the invasive tests used to rule out other diagnoses include risks. So, a need exists for a less problematic diagnostic tool to confirm the presence of FPIES. Researchers at the University of Michigan have designed a novel test to determine whether a child had FPIES and to predict which foods will be tolerable to an affected patient. This approach involves taking a blood sample following white blood cells are incubated with different food samples for three hours, given that the reaction associated with FPIES is commonly delayed for two to six hours after trigger food ingestion. A gene expression is then measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to evaluate which foods cause an immune response in the patient. Any one of a number of biomarkers can be measured to indicate the presence of non-IgE-mediated food intolerance. The test serves as the equivalent of an oral food challenge while removing the child from the risk of adverse reactions. While the prevalence of FPIES is thought to be small, its true scope may be better delineated through the use of this type of test. The potential exists for this diagnostic test to also be utilized for other non-IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity syndromes such as food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis, food protein-induced enteropathy, or celiac disease.",

Produces virtual models of jaw movements and occlusion without face bows or facial scanners. Use can be adopted by any dental office that already owns an intraoral scanner. Dental articulators are used to model a patient's dental occlusion and jaw movement and are important tools in diagnostics and therapy. Articulators comprise a mold of a patient's dental arches positioned, or mounted, in a way that replicates the patient's jaw movement. The production of physical articulators is time-consuming, so efforts have been put forth toward creating a means to create a virtual dental articulator through the use of computer modeling. This digital dentistry has permitted dentists to diagnose and treat patients more efficiently by creating digital counterparts for jaw movement and dentition in any patient. However, the use of virtual articulators is limited by the time, materials and/or expertise to create them. At least two pieces of equipment are required to create a virtual articulator: an intraoral scanner to acquire dental arch information, and a facebow to acquire the orientation of a patient's jaw in 3D to facilitate mounting. Facebows and their associated digitization software are not widely available, and a need exists for alternative mounting methods in order to increase the accessibility of virtual articulators to more dental practices. University of Michigan researchers have developed a method to mount a virtual articulator that requires only intraoral scans and calculations based on fixed reference points plus ruler measurements to model patients' jaw movements. This novel approach to digital dentistry eliminates the need for a facebow or face scanner.

Measures bile sludge accumulates to predict stent blockage. A stent is a small flexible plastic or metal tube that is used to prop open a constricted vessel or duct. Stents can be placed in the bile duct during a procedure known as endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP). While stents relieve symptoms caused by bile duct blockage, they accumulate tissue or biomass over time and eventually become blocked, commonly within three months after placement. Existing practices for monitoring stent blockage include blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging, or angiography, though these measures are imperfect and expensive. Shortcomings caused by these studies can lead to a preemptive and unnecessary invasive procedure to replace the stent before it is required, or they may alternatively lead patients to suffer significant symptoms before the need for stent replacement can be ascertained. Therefore, the need exists for a means by which to better assess the patency of stents in bile ducts. Researchers at the University of Michigan have integrated a magnetoelastic sensor into the internal lumen of a stent to further improve upon a direct wireless monitoring system they previously invented. The sensor is caused to mechanically vibrate via the application of an oscillating magnetic field from a coil external to the patient, generating an oscillating magnetic flux that can be measured with an external coil. The frequency response is sensitive to bile sludge accumulation and the stent blockage as the pathology progresses. Because the method is direct and wireless, it can alter the course of therapy at an earlier junction and prevent complications caused by stent occlusion.

An approach that may prove useful for treatment of other hematologic malignancies. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for about 45,000 new cases each year worldwide, and it is associated with rapid progression in the blood and bone marrow of affected patients. The disease is caused by damage to myeloid cells that normally exist in the bone marrow as precursors to red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Risk factors for developing AML include age greater than 65 years, male gender, prior exposure to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, blood disorders, or certain genetic abnormalities. AML has historically been treated with traditional chemotherapy regimens, though the results from this approach have yielded suboptimal results due to the persistence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Newer strategies for treating AML have focused on targeting cancer specific genes through the production of antibodies or chimeric antigen receptors that initiate the body's own immune system. While advances have been made in these types of therapies, a need exists for additional research and development of novel approaches to treat AML using immunologic approaches. Researchers at the University of Michigan have created a technology that combines chimeric antigen receptor technology with targeted therapies such as IL-7 to the CD123 entity for the treatment of patients with cancers such as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). CD123, which is also known as the interleukin-3 receptor alpha chain (IL-3Ralpha), is commonly overexpressed in AML, while interleukin-7 (IL-7) plays a key role in the development of T and B cells as they target cancer cells. The investigators show that signaling through IL-7 sensitizes T cells to low density antigens in the setting of AML, providing a means by which to develop treatments that are more targeted and robust. These T cells can then be activated using more traditional cell engineering approaches to recognize and kill cells in a tumor-associated, antigen-dependent manner. This treatment pathway is also associated with a decrease in off-target toxicity. This novel approach may prove effective in treating other hematologic malignancies.",

Digitally stores and interprets ICP and CSF flow data over multiple time periods. Accurate intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is essential to evaluating and treating traumatic brain injury (TBI) during the early hours of care. Evidence suggests that accurate ICP monitoring after primary decompressive craniectomy for TBI patients may significantly decrease in-hospital mortality. These measures are also critical in the rapidly changing environments common during patient transport or in field hospitals, as well as in ICU settings. The existing methods for monitoring and evaluating pressure are primitive and commonly consist of a collecting bag and pressure manometer. These systems require the caregiver to regularly evaluate data and to provide manual adjustments for any change in patient position or condition. Errors in monitoring or adjustments can lead to excess CSF losses or failure to recognize increasing ICP, leading to clinical deterioration of the patient. Therefore, a need exists for the ability to measure ICP while quantifying and regulating the flow of CSF in real time. Researchers have invented a digital extra-ventricular drain (DEVD) that improves the accuracy of intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow measurements and control while monitoring patient position and providing real-time alerts to caregivers when changes occur. The device fits well into current workflows, allowing for easy integration, and provides caregivers with advanced options to deliver specific, individualized care to their patients. Since the device automatically adjusts to changing patient position and CSF flow, it decreases caregiver workload and eliminates the need for manual adjustments. The fully automated processes therefore provide a safety net by alerting the caregiver of changing conditions in a timely manner.

Specimens are retrieved during a laparoscopic surgery by the use of specialized retrieval bags or devices that can securely isolate and contain the sample.

This approach reduces spillage of the specimen within the body cavity and maximizes efficiency of the retrieval. Still, the size of some specimens relative to the incision size can create challenges which require larger specimens to have to be morcellated, or fragmented, before removal.

As such, a need exists for an improved method to safely and efficiently retrieve specimens taken during laparoscopic surgical procedures. Inventors have created a device for improved specimen retrieval during minimally invasive surgery.

    "ip_description": "A device for arterial vessel fixation during surgical flap placement. Permits vessel eversion and joining through the use of a coupler ring. Decreases the need for surgical training and time spent on procedures. Tissue transfers from one site of a patient\u2019s body to another (flaps) and from a deceased donor to another (transplants) provide a means completing reproductive surgery. The goals of reconstructive surgery include repair of damaged tissues, recovery of appearance, or restoration of function and feeling. The most common clinical circumstances that lead to tissue transfer or transplant include trauma, thermal burns, cancer resection, or injury. Free flap tissue transfer first involves removal of skin, fat, muscle, nerves, and perhaps even bone from the donor site followed by reattachment at the recipient site. Surgical reattachment of veins and arteries to establish circulation often requires microanastamosis procedures that may prove labor intensive and expensive. Furthermore, the small diameter of most vessels requires specialized surgical training and the use of specialized equipment such as a surgical microscope to complete. As such, a need exists for an improved method to facilitate microanastamosis procedures during flap placement. Researchers have created a device that allows for arterial vessel fixation as well as arterial eversion to optimize the ability to secure to vessels together. This design is comprised of three main components: 1) a medical syringe, 2) a catheter balloon, and 3) an arterial everter, which rolls the vessel back on itself to form a cuff that exposes the endothelium. During the procedure the syringe is screwed into the designated inflation port of the catheter balloon, and then the everter is slid over the catheter balloon. The artery is then pulled through a coupler ring, and then the catheter balloon is inserted inside the artery. Once the catheter balloon is inserted to the correct length, it is inflated by depressing the syringe plunger. The everter is then slid down the catheter wire, it everts the artery, it pierces the artery wall onto the pins of the coupler ring, and then the vessels are secured.",

    "ip_description": "A lavage/suction tip to limit contamination during wound debridement and irrigation. Consists of a handpiece with a water jet and a transparent protective cover. Recovers fluids and debris to optimize personal protection compared to existing methods. Wound irrigation and debridement are important aspects of wound care that are carried out to prevent infection and promote healing. Irrigation involves the flushing of an open wound with a fluid saline solution to clean the surface and remove loose debris. The debridement phase of wound care includes removal of dead, damaged, or infected tissue with the goal of exposing healthier tissue to promote the healing process. Any of several different methods may be used to try to prevent splashback during wound irrigation and debridement, including the use of personal protective equipment. Further protection can be provided by surrounding the wound with towels or drapes, irrigating the wound with a controlled and steady pressure, and employing a splash shield. Still, even with the stringent use of existing methods, a risk persists that healthcare providers will be exposed to contamination due to splashback during wound irrigation. As such, a need exists for improved methods of shielding during wound irrigation and debridement. Researchers have created a lavage/suction tip to provide irrigating fluid to a wound while providing suction to remove fluids and debris away from the surgical site. The handpiece includes a fluid jet with a sealing edge that adapts to the shape of the patient and provides an airtight closure which eliminates splashback. When necessary, the splash shield may be retracted so that the distal end of the tip may be positioned directly against an irrigation site. The pressure line for the water jet opens laterally into the lateral surface close to the handpiece and forms a discharge nozzle there. The protective cover is configured in the form of a funnel in the region of the suction opening to improve the take up of the water separating jet and the separated tissue parts. The cover is made of a transparent material in order to permit viewing into the work chamber from the outside, and therefore onto the work area.",

    "ip_description": "Customized, 3D printed tracheostomy plugs for individual patients. A medical grade silicone plug that is self-retained in the tracheostomy site. Reduces skin irritation, air leaks, swallowing troubles, and diminished voice. Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure wherein an incision is created along the trachea (windpipe) to open the airway. The resulting tracheostomy opening, or stoma, in the anterior lower neck serves as an independent airway or a site for placement of a tracheostomy tube. Limitations faced by tracheostomy patients include local skin irritation, difficulties with speech, trouble swallowing, limitations with bathing, and facing a social stigma. These issues may be addressed by the placement of either a capping or plugging device in the tracheostomy site, though these approaches suffer from shortcomings, as well. For example, caps and plugs are not customizable to individual anatomy and may lead to a poor fit that can require surgical placement or emergency removal in certain cases. Even those caps which fit well require a neck tie to keep them in place. As such, a need exists for an improved method to create tracheostomy caps and plugs which minimize the aforementioned problems. Inventors have created a custom fitted, three-dimensionally (3D) printed tracheostomy plug that is designed to match each patient\u2019s airway using modeling. The 3D modeling is based upon information acquired from computerized tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, or 3D surface scans. The 3D information is utilized by computer aided design modeling software to create a 3D printed, medical silicone grade plug that is self-retained in the tracheostomy site. The plugs are low profile and fully seal to the tracheostomy site, which reduces both skin irritation and air-leak secretion. The soft silicone material enhances patient comfort, optimizes swallowing functions, and enables an improved voice strength. The inserted end of the plug is wider than the narrowest portion of the tract, while the remainder of the plug is the exact dimension. Externally, there is a flange that is significantly wider than the tract and prevents aspiration. Unlike existing devices, this tracheostomy plug can be easily removed and replaced by the patient, without any need for the use of neck ties. This technology has broad clinical relevance to patient airway management.",

    "ip_description": "Bidirectional stopcock for pulmonary artery catheterization device. Eliminates connection failures compared to existing H-lock luer and lock designs. Minimizes incorrect waveform readings and risks for infection, blood loss, and air embolism. A pulmonary artery catheter (PAC), which is also known as a Swan-Ganz catheter, is a medical device utilized in diagnostic procedures to measure pressures in the heart\u2019s chambers and to deliver therapeutics. Pulmonary artery catheterization serves as an excellent tool for the assessment of patients with pulmonary hypertension, cardiogenic shock, or unexplained dyspnea. These catheters are typically inserted into a large vein \u2014 often in the neck, chest, or groin \u2014 and threaded toward the right side of the heart leading to the pulmonary artery. To assemble a PAC, caregivers are required to put together multiple individual transducers that will allow for the sampling of blood, infusion of saline, and monitor connections. This complex arrangement involves the attachment of between three and five stopcocks connected by a male to male adapter, along with a luer-lock adapter/sampling port. A need therefore exists for a simplified apparatus that serves the same function as existing PACs. Inventors have created a one-piece arrangement of valves and tubing connectors to facilitate monitoring, sampling, and infusion through the various lumens of a pulmonary artery catheter. The invention highlights a single device, a bidirectional stopcock, through which all lines of the catheter assembly can be connected. This design eliminates the risk of connection failures of the catheter assembly when compared to existing H-bar lumen and luer lock designs, minimizing the likelihood of incorrect waveform readings. The innovation also reduces the risk for infection, blood loss, and air embolism, thereby improving patient safety. The components of the device are sterile, transparent to permit light transmission, and capable of tolerating required flow rates. Testing has shown proper fluid flow through the stopcock, no observable leaking, and intuitive attachment of colored lumens between the catheters. Overall, this technology is fully compatible with Swan-Ganz catheter lumens and is intuitive and easy to use.",

    "ip_description": "A new method for storage and transportation of mammalian cell lines. Employs the use of trehalose to dry cells into a uniform desiccated matrix. Permits storage at ambient temperatures without the need for cryopreservation. Cell-based manufacturing is a major source of protein therapeutics for a variety of illnesses. The isolation and maintenance of mammalian cell lines are particularly important in this setting due to their biological closeness to human cells. The storage and protection of mammalian cell lines is more difficult than circumstances involving bacteria or yeast. These cell lines are most commonly frozen in cryovials and stored in liquid nitrogen or freezers set to -80\u00b0C to maintain long term cell integrity and viability. However, these existing cryopreservation methods are complex to perform and costly to maintain over the long term. Even the smallest change in temperature from tightly defined constraints can cause cell degradation or death. Given the large and growing market for cell-based medical therapeutics that uses living cells to produce biologic compounds, a need exists for improved methods of cell line protection and storage. Researchers have created a method to dry specifically prepared mammalian cells that allows for efficient and inexpensive storage at ambient temperatures without compromising cell viability. This new technique employs a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line designed to work with trehalose, a sugar that prevents mammalian cell damage under anhydrous conditions. This novel cell line is called CHO-TRETn1 and expresses a trehalose transporter protein that helps move trehalose into the cell cytoplasm. The study cells are dip-coated in a trehalose solution during a drying procedure, creating a uniformly desiccated matrix of cells which maintain a 94% survival rate. The resulting matrix can simply be stored at ambient temperatures until they are rehydrated when they are needed again. The uniformity of the results suggests that the approach may prove especially useful as a source material in plug flow bioreactor manufacturing. Overall, this invention permits lower storage and transportation costs for mammalian cell lines used in the research and manufacture of recombinant protein and other biologic therapeutics.",

Organ-on-a-chip platforms are biomedical research tools to evaluate miniaturized versions of human organs on micro-engineered chip devices. These platforms mimic physiologic organ functioning to provide studies of functionality, disease states, and responses to pharmaceutical interventions. Organ-on-a-chip platforms have the potential to offer more cost-effective, ethical, and human-resembling models than animal models for disease study and drug discovery. Temporal profiling of multiple biomarker concentrations in this tissue model adds understanding the onset, progression, and resolution of common disorders. One area of growing interest involves the desire to recreate the semipermeable border which separates blood from the brain and extracellular fluid in the central nervous system. This blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions to protect the brain from harmful substances in the blood, while concurrently supplying the brain with important nutrients. Any shortcomings of the gatekeeping responsibilities of the BBB can lead to serious disorders, so a need exists to optimize methods for studying this interface. Inventors have created a means by which to provide digital molecular fingerprinting of detachable organ-on-a-chip systems, including blood brain barrier on a chip (BBB-oC). This innovation integrates digital immunosensors into an organ-on-a-chip platform using a novel 'tacking and ultrafast digital fingerprinting' methodology. This approach meets several requirements and addresses several difficulties associated with immunosensing in existing organ-on-a-chip platforms. The new device can replace current ex situ immunoassay pipelines with in situ sensitive digital immunoassay measurements to provide several improvements. The digital immunoassay provides multiplexity, shorter assay times (<30 minutes duration), increased sensitivity, temporal profiling, microenvironment preservation, and ease of use. The method has been capable of profiling longitudinally produced cytokine secretions from BBB-oC endotoxin LPS) exposure. This BBB-oC can therefore better provide a human model of the multifunctional tissue working as an important node to control pathogen entry, drug delivery and neuroinflammation. The technology is also extensively applicable to profiling temporal protein secretion of other microfluidic organ-on-a-chip systems and can provide helpful insights in cytokine level fluctuations in sequentially controlled experiments.",

    "ip_description": "A portable guidance device to improve spinal needle placement. Includes a position sensor to guide placement and avoid bone. Cost effective, easy to use, and fits into existing workflows. Epidural injections allow the delivery of drugs, like anesthetics and steroids, into a narrow space near the spinal cord. Many procedures, including anesthesia used during childbirth, require the accurate and reliable insertion of the needle into the epidural space while avoiding adjacent, critical structures. Incorrect needle placement can cause complications including inadequate pain relief, post-dural puncture headaches, or nerve damage. This procedure is technically difficult, and most doctors still utilize a \u2018blind\u2019 approach without the use of assistive technology to place the needle. Using this method, the operator advances the needle against the dura until they \u2018feel a pop\u2019 or perceive a \u2018loss of resistance\u2019, suggesting arrival of the needle into the intradural space. As a result, approximately 30% of spinal needle insertions are initially misplaced, leading to longer procedure times, patient discomfort, and higher costs. As such, a need exists for improved methods to place needles for epidural injections. Researchers have created a portable guidance device that uses built-in sensors to improve spinal needle placement. The device includes an actuator that applies multi-frequency force to the tissue via a probe while a blunt inter-needle probe extends past the needle and uses a force sensor to record tissue resistance. A position sensor simultaneously records the distance between the blunt probe and needle while an electronic processor translates the information to determine the tissue type. One important upshot of this alignment is that the presence of bone can be detected, and therefore avoided. The operator slowly guides the needle containing a probe into the patient, with force periodically applied by the actuator to push the probe past the needle to sense resistance. Once the display reveals that the needle is close to its target, the probe and device are removed and the needle is placed in the correct space. Unlike ultrasound-based guidance approaches which are costly and require additional training, this device is cost-effective, easy to use, and fits into the existing workflow of epidural injections.",

    "ip_description": "A model and fit algorithm to improve MRI scanning in patients with cancer. Better differentiates water diffusion rates in vascular, ductal lumen, and cellular tissue. May be utilized at the time of image acquisition or retroactively following scanning. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is extensively used in cancer detection because of its ability to noninvasively capture detailed images of the body\u2019s internal organs. One specific MRI technique used specifically for these purposes involves the calculation of the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), which measures water molecule diffusion in tissues. The quantitative evaluation of water molecule diffusion is impacted by the cellular structure and organization of a tissue, with malignant lesions commonly more restrictive to water movement. Specifically, cancerous tumors have a higher ratio of cellularity to extracellular space, causing an increased epithelium volume that decreases the presence of stroma and limits lumen size. The resulting lower ADC value on MRI scans correlates with tissue microstructure and aids screening of cancer as well as the results of anti-neoplastic interventions. Still, ADC uses a simple two-point measurement and has been associated with unnecessary biopsies in a number of clinical studies. As such, a need exists for improved methods to utilize MRI scanning for screening and treatment response in patients with cancer. Researchers have created a model and fit algorithm that better optimizes the usefulness of MRI scanning in the setting of cancer staging in glandular tissues. The innovation more effectively quantitates impeded diffusion fraction (IDF) contribution from water coordinated by macromolecules to diffusion weighted image (DWI) voxel signals. The methodology takes into account fundamentally different water diffusion rates in vascular, ductal lumen, and cellular tissue compartments. This approach can be applied to develop quantitative imaging essays with objective thresholds for multiple types of cancers by utilization of common acquisition protocols. Additionally, the model may be utilized either at the time of image acquisition or respectively after the MRI has been completed. The ability to remove unwanted signal components from bound water are especially important for evaluating clinical data, which often faces more imaging noise. Additionally, the innovation may be used to evaluate any type of organ, given that its only hard assumption involves T-dependent diffusion of water.",

The customized plastic polymer plate is chemically inert and has bone density. Twenty percent of individuals develop holes in the tegmen tympani, a thin plate of bone that separates the middle ear from the brain. Defects in the tegmen create risk for severe and life-threatening complications including meningitis, cerebral spinal fluid leakage and brain herniation into the middle ear cavity. Small tegmen defects can be repaired by plugging with bone cement or similar material, while larger or multiple defects require more invasive surgical procedures. Surgery often involves removing a segment of bone from another region of the skull to patch over the defect, though manual customization of bone fragment grafts is time consuming. Additionally, the repair of larger defects is more complex because larger bone grafts are more difficult to harvest and customize to the site in need. As such, a need exists for improved methodologies to create custom grafts for patients undergoing surgery for tegmen tympani defects. Researchers have invented a medical device that repairs or replaces cranial bone defects such as those which may occur in the tegmen tympani. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the area is completed to permit the creation of a virtual three dimensional (3D) model of the temporal bone. Computer-aided design (CAD) software creates a virtual repair of the defect, allowing production of a plastic polymer plate using additive manufacturing techniques. The CAD model utilizes device specifications which optimize functionality of the plate, including a thickness of 1.5 mm, rounding of the edges, and elevation off the tegmen by 0.3 mm. The plastic polymer that is used is a polyetherketoneketone (PEKK), which is chemically inert and has a density and stiffness similar to natural bone. The design has been validated in three cadaveric temporal bone repairs using a surgical drill to create defects and customized plates to repair the defect.",

Allows for rapid multiplex quantification of samples from critically ill patients. Microarrays are a ubiquitous tool in life science research and consist of micro-patterned sensing spots on a rigid substrate, most often a glass slide. Protein or antibody microarrays have also been employed in integrated microfluidics systems given their ability to detect an extremely high number of analytes in a small volume. Though protein microarrays offer large multiplex capacity through spatial encoding, they universally suffer from poor limit of detection as well as measurement imprecision. These microarrays also lack in signal amplification as in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and show inconsistencies in protein patterning. As such, protein microarrays are not typically used for precise quantitative measurements in the same way as ELISA and are more often employed for broad-spectrum screening and proteomics studies. A need exists for an amplification strategy to improve the quantitative capabilities of protein microarrays while maintaining the multiplex capacity and capability for microfluidics integration. Researchers have created a device that provides a precise, quantitative, microarray-format measurement of a large number of biomarkers in liquid sample solutions. The device is called the Digital Protein Microarray (DPMA) and employs a strategy of single molecule detection for signal amplification. The DPMA is fabricated on a glass slide using a novel method of protein patterning, and it is readily integrated into a wide range of microfluidics devices. The platform includes two low-cost modules, a semi-automated fluidic dispensing/mixing module and a compact fluorescent optical scanner for near-bedside readouts. This single-molecule counting strategy improves the limit of detection and measurement precision of the traditional protein microarray while maintaining the spatial analyte encoding strategy for highly multiplexed measurements.

The technology includes a nanoplastic filter using nanoparticles on a substrate with photoconductive thin film and characterizes various biomarkers from samples including blood, saliva, and urine. Precision medicine is emerging clinical care designed to target particular groups of patients for optimal therapeutic benefit. Molecular profiling of disease biomarkers is one of the key methods used in enabling precision medicine. Conventional molecular profiling techniques, such as enzyme-linked immusorbent assay (ELISA) and bead-based immunoassay processes require lengthy and complicated assay processes, some of which require up to 8 hours to complete. These limitations prevent clinicians from analyzing biomarker profiles and host responses to drugs in real time at the place of patient care. Still, active monitoring of the time-varying immune status of a diseased host often requires rapid and sensitive detection of cytokines. Metallic nanoparticle-based localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) biosensors hold promise to meet this clinical need by permitting label-free detection of target biomolecules. However, these biosensors suffer from relatively low sensitivity when compared to conventional immunoassay methods that involve labeling processes. As such, a need exists for a method to rapidly quantify cytokine levels to optimize delivery of critical care. Researchers have created a nanotechnology-based biological sensor device platform that is battery-operated, portable, mechanically flexible, and self-contained, enabling simultaneous profiling of the concentration levels of multiple biomarker molecules.

For example, a patient\u2019s immune status can be evaluated to direct point-of-care precision medicine in the setting of systemic immune disorders and inflammatory responses to trauma.

    "ip_description": "A portable device that drains urine and irrigates neurogenic bladders in men or women. Safe, easily cleaned, and less error prone than chronic intermittent catheterization. Useful for patients with neurogenic bladder from any cause. Urination occurs when a person's brain sends electrical signals to muscles of the lower urinary tract to induce a neuro-muscular response that resulting in bladder emptying. Neurogenic bladder (NB) disorder is the chronic disruption of this communication between the nervous system and the urinary tract through any of a number of causes. NB impairs functioning such as loss of the ability to empty the bladder, and patients must therefore utilize clear intermittent catheterization (CIC) to drain their urine. The process for CIC involves draining urine via a catheter placed in the urethra as well as irrigation of the bladder with saline via a syringe. CIC may prove ineffective and time-consuming, leading to low patient compliance and health complications such as urinary tract infections, bladder and kidney stones, and renal failure. A need therefore exists for an accessible, time-efficient, and portable method to sufficiently drain and irrigate patients' bladders that maintains safe pressure, flow, and urine volume levels while reducing infections. Researchers have created a portable and accessible device that drains urine and irrigates neurogenic bladders in patients who require chronic intermittent catheterization (CIC). The invention employs mechanically-induced flow through the use of a peristaltic pump that works via a motorized rotor which applies pressure to the pump\u2019s inner tubing. The positive pressure and vacuum produced by the device does not exceed the tolerance of the bladder wall, and both an automatic shutoff and alarm announce unsafe pressure conditions. The off and on switch may be easily managed from a physical standpoint and can be understood by patients with limited or impaired cognitive capabilities. This innovation is called Enginuity, and its advantages include portability, active bladder draining, and the ability to perform irrigation after urine drainage. Furthermore, the device drains the bladder more quickly than CIC, may be easily cleaned, and functions with the anatomy from either gender or even in the setting of a permanent stoma.",

Stimulation can be controlled by healthcare provider or the patient, themself. Cervical collars are often used in the post-operative setting following neck or cervical spine surgery. The intent of the collar is to provide immobilization and support to prevent pain and further injury. Still, neck pain during the postoperative setting can be difficult to manage, and oral pain medications are imperfect with regards to aiding discomfort and minimizing side effects. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a non-invasive technique often used to provide pain relief through the delivery of low-voltage electrical impulses to the area in pain. The likely underlying mechanism for TENS units successfully diminishing pain involves stimulation of non-painful nerves to block transmission of pain signals from involved nerves. TENS units are versatile, and the intensity, frequency, and duration of the electrical impulses delivered can be adjusted over time. Given the common use of cervical collars and potential benefits of TENS units in controlling pain, a need exists for a means to combine these two important post-operative interventions. Researchers have created a device that incorporates a TENS unit into a hard cervical collar to allow for electrical stimulation of nerves and muscles of the neck in the post-operative setting.

The two most common existing methods to deal with ear malformations are ear molding in newborns or surgery, which is usually delayed until 8-10 years of age. Given that only 30% of ear deformities are self-correcting and that delays in treatment can cause psychosocial or developmental harm, ear molding is the preferred pathway for treatment. However, ear molding is limited to outer ear deformities where the ear is misshapen, but not missing. As such, a need exists for improved methods for remodeling newborn ears where existing methods are insufficient. Researchers have created an ear splint to help model external ear cartilage during the first few weeks of life in infants born with malformations. Each splint may be created by three dimensional (3D) printing to permit an exact fit for each individual patient. Compared to existing devices, the ear splint has a lower profile, is comfortable, and costs far less to produce. The design and production of each splint is rapid, and its attachment avoids adhesives that can cause complications and skin breakdown. This central portion of the splint has a central portion which dwells within the anterior scaphoid section of an ear as well as a wing portion positioned along the postauricular area of the ear. A magnetic device resides in the central portion while a second magnetic device is located in the wing portion, thereby exerting a magnetic attractive force between the two. The ear splint can also be used as a postoperative dressing for ear surgeries where its secure fit may minimize the risk of post-surgical hematoma formation. Further potential uses for the device include situations where sealing or hearing protection are desired, including during swimming, using firearms, or aviation applications.",

    "ip_description": "Microchip device that measures biomarkers present during sepsis. Transmits data to a smartphone machine learning algorithms to direct care. Shows promise for other systemic illnesses such as asthma and inflammatory diseases. Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to infection that affects over 750,000 people in the United States each year and leads to 250,000 deaths. Sepsis can lead to organ failure, though its onset may be difficult to diagnose due to the heterogeneity of the disease coupled with lengthy delays in obtaining results of blood cultures. The wait for an accurate diagnosis of sepsis may therefore take days, though timely delivery of treatment is essential to prevent rapid progression of the inflammation into septic shock. The identification of serum biomarkers might provide a means by which to provide early detection, prompt intervention, and progression monitoring of sepsis. While point-of-care solutions have shortened diagnostic times to 1 hour, those approaches are limited in their ability to integrate with clinical workflow, manufacturability, and robustness. As such, a need exists for improved methods to measure biomarkers which herald the onset of sepsis and assess treatment response. Researchers have developed a microchip device called the Smart Pipette that successfully analyzes blood serum for several biomarkers present during sepsis. The device incorporates structurally engineered gold nanoparticle biosensor arrays and atomically thin photoconductive nanosheet channels into a compact module architecture. The disposable system tests blood samples for four cytokines, including procalcitonin and interleukins IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-10. The recovered data is readily transmitted to a smartphone where machine learning algorithms provide insight on disease severity and potential treatment practices. This rapid point of care system provides results within 30 minutes, negating the potentially deleterious effects of waiting for blood culture results before initiating therapy. It may be utilized in intensive care units or even by first responders assessing patients who have become ill in a home or nursing home setting. While designed for sepsis, this technology shows promise in detecting other systemic illnesses such as asthma and acute respiratory distress.",

    "ip_description": "A method to transplant islet cells onto microporous polyethylene glycol scaffolds. Transplanted islet cells sense blood glucose levels and produce insulin. Post-transplant, local environment control permits the islet cells to thrive. Islet cell transplantation is a potential treatment option for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), which is a chronic disease resulting from an autoimmune attack on the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. As a result, patients with type 1 DM are unable to produce adequate insulin to regulate their blood sugar levels, resulting in an array of deleterious clinical repercussions. One treatment approach for this illness involves transplanting islets containing beta cells into a recipient's liver to help regulate blood sugar levels. The transplantation approach can be adversely affected by a recipient's immune system rejection of the transplanted islets, and use of this the procedure is limited by a relative lack of donors as well as its expense. Those limitations commonly relegate use of transplantation to clinical circumstances in which patients with DM suffer from clinical conditions which cannot be controlled by insulin therapy. As such, a need exists for a means to transplant islets into extrahepatic sites which enable engraftment and long-term functioning. Researchers have identified a method to transplant islet cells onto microporous polyethylene glycol (PEG) scaffolds that allow for revascularization of the transplanted islets. This approach provides the nutrients necessary for islet cell survival while also facilitating the ability to sense blood glucose levels and the distribution of insulin. While previous islet encapsulation technologies have been limited because they limit neovascularization and hinder mass transport of encapsulated cells, these microporous scaffolds are functionalized with extracellular matrix proteins and trophic factors to control the local environment. These refinements permit the microporous PEG hydrogel scaffolds to transplant islets or beta-cell progenitors to a clinically translatable, extrahepatic site, such as the peritoneum, omentum, muscle or epididymal fat. Additionally, the scaffolds may be functionalized with immune cytokines to modulate innate and adaptive immune responses to delay rejection or promote immune tolerance. The ability to control the local environment post-transplantation helps to account for the variance in islet cell quality between donors and provides a permissive environment where the islet cells can survive.",

The novel feature of this synthesis includes chemical vapor deposition with adjustments in the geometry and type of a liquid crystal controlling the shape and chirality of the resulting nanowires. This process can control the nanowire length from 200 nanometers to 100 microns. As compared to metallic nanowires, these polymer nanowires are easier to process, and the surface properties can be readily adapted by incorporating functional molecules. The nanowires possess the shared characteristics of electrical conductance and optical transparency, allowing them to be dispersed on flexible, polymer films. The polymer can be functionalized with different reactive surface groups, which could presumably help in tailoring materials for specific applications. The investigators can create nanowires in the form of aligned nanowire arrays supported on a solid, in the form of nanowire mats supported on porous materials, or as individual free-standing nanowires.

Controls the amount of functionality of the scaffold attached to proteins, peptides, or small molecules. Allows delivery of immunoregulatory molecules, growth factors, and cell-binding domains. The purposeful delivery of proteins to cellular environments may be used to elicit desired responses from the cells. The attachment of proteins to polymer scaffolds represents an advantage in their over delivery other approaches, such as encapsulation. Current methods that functionalize polymer scaffolds involve post preparation modification of the polymer scaffold with proteins, peptides, or other small molecules. However, modification methods following polymer scaffold preparation are typically inefficient and inconsistent between batches. In particular, due to the porous nature of the polymer scaffolds, it is difficult for this approach to produce a homogeneous coating of proteins, peptides, or other small molecules. Thus, a need exists for polymer scaffolds that can improve upon the limitations inherent in the existing mechanisms for their production. Researchers have discovered a method of preparing a polymer scaffold including an admixture of a biotinylated reagent and a polymer. The reactive handle of the polymer is capable of reacting with a biomolecule to form either covalent or non-covalent bonds, providing control over the functionality of the scaffold. This biotinylated polymer creates conditions sufficient to form the polymer scaffold which can allow for the attachment a broad range of protein, peptides, or small molecules to the surface of the scaffold, permitting its use in a wide range of applications. Suitable polymers may include functional groups such as carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehydes, amines, amides, esters, and combinations thereof. This approach creates advantages such as providing a known quantity of reactive handles as well as permitting a means to purposely distribute them spatially throughout the polymer structure. Examples of applications related to this innovation include the provision of immunoregulatory molecules to protect transplanted tissue, the delivery of growth factors to stimulate growth, differentiation, or proliferation, and the presentation of cell binding domains to provide physical cues and adhesion.",

Neurotrophic factors found in the central nervous system (CNS) promote survival of developing and lesioned neurons while also enhancing nerve growth and regeneration. Clinically, regeneration of damage neurons after injury or disease can be accelerated via introduction of a biologic or small molecule therapy. Methods for delivery of these therapies typically rely on bolus injection which utilizes high does and results in the agent being widely dispersed.

    "ip_description": "A cam-based transmission and stiffness modulation unit to improve existing knee-ankle orthoses. Provides a novel means by which to more closely match human biomechanics during gait. Allows variations in energy return to optimize overall energy storage and return (ESR). Commercially available prosthetic ankle-foot orthoses commonly behave like springs that store and return energy to the wearer as they ambulate. However, these devices do not conform to the appropriate torque-angle relationship which occurs during able-bodied walking. The mechanics of normal gait follow what is known as the 'quasi-stiffness' curve, and the choice of prosthetic stiffness cannot vary during different phases of walking to match the normal state. The inability to design devices with nonlinear stiffness characteristics causes hindrances at specific points of the gait cycle, depending upon which stiffness is chosen for the orthosis. Energy and storage return (ESR) is also difficult to optimize in prosthetic feet across phases of standing and walking, especially when traversing stairways. The resulting compensatory gait abnormalities created by patient efforts to correct for these imperfections can result in socket pain, back pain, and joint diseases. A need therefore exists to develop an ankle-foot prosthesis which exhibits appropriate biomechanics during the different phases of gait, such as those which exist while walking, moving up and down stairs, or standing quietly. Researchers have invented a cam-based transmission and stiffness modulation unit to more closely match human biomechanics during gait. The system is comprised of a cam profile and a cam follower, the latter of which may be positioned within the concave portion when the assistive device in located in an equilibrium position. The cam profile is positioned to rotate about a joint of the device in response to a force applied during a stance phase of gait, while the cam follower can be coupled to a leaf spring and roll along the curved outer edge of the cam profile from dorsiflexion to plantarflexion. A sliding element is positioned on a motor-powered screw that adjusts the position of the sliding element on the surface of the leaf spring, and the position of this sliding element can be manually adjusted. The invention also allows for the use of multiple cam profiles to allow variations in energy return and optimize energy storage and return (ESR). Overall, the invention provides a cam-based transmission and stiffness modulation unit that can be varied continuously to improve the biomechanics of prosthetic ankle-foot orthoses.",

    "ip_description": "A single, unified prosthesis controller that captures the entire gait cycle through virtual constraints. Eliminates the need to divide the gait into different periods with independent controllers. Reduces the number of control parameters that must be tuned for each new patient. Powered prosthetic legs are employed in an effort to optimize the usefulness of orthoses for patients following amputation. Several control methods have been proposed for facilitating these devices, but almost all of them divide the gait cycle into multiple, sequential periods with different controllers. In one common approach, a machine switches between joint impedance controllers based on the period of gait, though a more complex approach using a combination of finite state machines with task-specific impedance controllers may be utilized. The latter approach requires substantial tuning of control parameters and switching rules for each period and task, potentially requiring several hours to configure a powered knee-ankle prosthesis for a single amputee patient. When perturbed, this control approach could switch to the wrong state and use the wrong controller, which may increase an amputee\u2019s risk of falling. Given that humans move in a smooth, continuous manner over a periodic gait cycle, a need exists for a reactive controller that accounts for normal characteristics of biped ambulation, and which unifies the gait cycle and provides stability. Researchers have devised a novel control strategy for an above-knee powered prosthetic leg that unifies the entire gait cycle, therefore eliminating the need to switch between controllers during different phases of the gait cycle. The new device provides an improvement over existing control methods which divide the gait cycle into several sequential periods with independent controllers that vary by patient-specific control parameters and require tuning by clinicians. This single controller reduces the number of control parameters needing to be tuned for each patient, thereby reducing the clinical time and effort required for fitting a powered prosthesis for each lower-limb amputee. An additional advantage of a unified controller includes its potential favorable impact on exoskeletons and autonomous bipedal robots. This advancement permits exact characterization of the desired actuated joint motion over the entire gait cycle from a single output function. A reduced-order Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) is used to define virtual constraints that continuously parameterize periodic joint patterns as functions of a mechanical phasing variable. The feasibility of the controller has been demonstrated using simulations of an amputee walking model, showing that a single, unified controller can accommodate a range of human walking speeds. Future device iterations will attempt to demonstrate clinical viability by allowing clinicians to visually modify trajectories while configuring the control system for different amputee subjects.",

    "ip_description": "A variable stiffness actuator (VSA) that can modulate its stiffness to improve powered ankle-foot orthoses. The technology uses a dielectric elastomer system (DES) to eliminate the need for a second motor to modulate stiffness, resulting in a PAFO actuator that increases portability and optimizes user compliance. Powered Ankle-Foot Orthoses (PAFOs) provide walking assistance to people with neuromuscular impairments. Series Elastic Actuators (SEA), consisting of a conventional actuator connected in series through an elastic element to a load, offer several benefits for PAFOs. They provide a safer human-machine interface, reduce the cost for closed-loop force control, and can weigh less than rigid PAFO actuators with the same peak power output capability. The optimal stiffness value for a PAFO SEA's elastic element depends on the task the PAFO user is performing, the user's weight, and personal gait pattern. A Variable Stiffness Actuator (VSA) is needed to optimize the effects of PAFO. Researchers have invented a VSA that is mechanically simple, free of rolling or sliding parts, allows stiffness changes while loaded, and improves significantly upon existing designs. This novel approach utilizes a dielectric elastomer system (DES) in the VSA's variable stiffness mechanism, yielding an architecture which eliminates the need for a second motor to modulate stiffness. DE are flexible polymers coated with flexible electrodes that expand when energized with electrical charges. The advantages of this invention over existing VSA designs are manifold: 1) the VSA may weigh less since it does not require a motor for stiffness modulation; 2) the VSA can change stiffness rapidly enabling modulation of its stiffness during operation; 3) the DE could regenerate energy during operation; 4) DE can work as strain and force sensors; and 5) the PAFO can be more comfortable to wear since DE can be formed into shapes that conform to the user\u2019s body. This design permits changes in the electrical field on the DES to modulate the stiffness of the actuator. As such, this form of VSA softens when energized and is thus 'default-stiff,' which is beneficial for applications requiring rigid, unpowered behavior such as exists in many robotic prosthetic legs. Experimental results indicate the viability of this approach for modulating stiffness and verify that the actuator generates forces meaningful for gait assistance.",

    "ip_description": "An orthotic control strategy that provides variable weight augmentation for mobile gait training. A powered lower-limb exoskeleton provides body weight support (BWS) after a neurologic injury. Permits patients to relearn their natural walking gates while training outside clinical environments. Individuals who have sustained a stroke, spinal cord injury, or other neurological condition often struggle to ambulate, and they require gait training to regain mobility and independence. The most common existing methods for providing gait training involve providing the patient body weight support (BWS) during training to help them produce the coordinated muscle activities needed for walking. The conventional technique supplies BWS through a torso or hip harnesses attached to an overhead lift. However, conventional BWS training systems are mounted to a stationary site on the ceiling or treadmill and require significant labor by the clinicians who must move the full weight of patient's limbs. The available powered exoskeletons can help address mobility limitations, though their control systems follow pre-defined joint patterns and discourage patients from actively participating in the training process. Therefore, a need exists for a less restrictive form of BWS through the use of mobile, wearable control systems. Researchers have devised a novel control system for powered lower-limb exoskeletons (or orthoses) that provides body-weight support (BWS) for people who have sustained a stroke and other neurological injury. Patients are provided with BWS during conventional gait retraining to help them produce the coordinated muscle activities needed for walking. This control system virtually provides BWS to reduce the gravitational forces experienced by the user's center of mass and lower extremities during locomotion without pre-defined patterns, permitting patients to relearn their natural walking gaits while training outside of clinical environments. Simulation results show that gaits can be augmented in a beneficial way for gait rehabilitation, where patients can start training with easier gaits having higher swing foot clearances to avoid tripping. Though initially created as a rehabilitation tool, this position feedback-based controller could potentially reduce clinicians' workload and lead to a more efficient gait training process.

In clinical settings that require gait rehabilitation for patients who have suffered neurologic disabilities due to stroke or spinal cord injuries, current robotic exoskeletons are limited by an approach that enforces pre-defined joint patterns that are task-specific and user-dependent. To incorporate different locomotor tasks, these exoskeletons have to recognize the subject's intent to switch control modes within a limited set of options. The limited number of options prevents these devices from accommodating varying daily activities, and misclassification or faulty detections of transition events can cause falls. For instance, in human walking, contact varies from heel to toe resulting in multiple periods of underactuation, which cannot be captured by the existing framework. Moreover, the tendencies for these rehabilitation aids to reinforce reference trajectories replicates normative joint kinematics but does not facilitate active learning. As such, the patient may become constrained in ways that lead them to fail in their attempts relearn their own natural walking gaits during training. So, a need exists for new, trajectory-free control methods that allow robotic exoskeletons to replicate joint kinematics while facilitating patient-specific kinematics. Researchers have invented a control methodology that provides trajectory-free, consistent assistance across all possible locomotion activities to patients undergoing gait rehabilitation. This innovation provides an exoskeletal control strategy for augmenting step length and step linear velocity via total energy shaping. The device also shapes the total mechanical energy of the combined human and exoskeleton system to permit the subject to feel acceleration and deceleration forces while walking more easily. The user can also more easily perceive the gravitational forces being exerted on their center of mass and lower extremities. Using simple anatomical measurements, this controller can be easily implemented on powered exoskeletons to allow gait training outside of clinical environments.

Designed for compactness to provide ease of use for patients with arthritis or lower back pain. Shown in experiments to require less quadricep activation during lifting-lowering, sit-to-stand, and stair climbing. Traditional exoskeletons are used to aid paraplegic individuals with little to no voluntary movement, such as may occur after suffering a spinal cord injury or cerebrovascular accident. These orthoses are therefore commonly designed to produce high torque output using highly geared motors to fully support the legs. However, a larger population with musculoskeletal disorders would benefit from partial rather than full assistance of their musculature. Examples of these patient groups include those with osteoarthritis and low back pain, either of which may be contributed to by weak quadriceps musculature. Orthoses that provide assistance in quadricep strength could mitigate arthritis pain by reducing high forces across the knee joint when going from the sitting to standing positions or when walking up stairs. Similarly, quadricep assistance might help relieve back pain from repetitive lifting and lowering tasks. Partial-assist devices must both minimize the torque required by the user to backdrive the actuator during voluntary movements and minimize weight and size for a convenient design. So, a need exists for new partial-assist powered orthoses to improve the lives of patients with these diseases. Researchers have invented a novel, backdrivable powered knee orthosis for partial assistance of lower-limb musculature that aims to facilitate daily activities in individuals with musculoskeletal disorders. The actuator design is guided by principles that prioritize compactness, backdrivability, and output torque to permit ease and efficiency of patient movements. This design increases the motor diameter and decreases the transmission ratio while maintaining the desired output torque, thereby reducing the reflected inertia and backdrive torque. Heat output from the device is optimally managed by using a custom brushless DC motor with encapsulated windings. The choice for a 7:1 planetary gearset placed directly into the stator provides the actuator with a package factor that reduces size and weight. Benchtop tests verify that the custom actuator can produce at least 23.9 Nm peak torque and 12.78 Nm continuous torque yet has less than 2.68 Nm backdrive torque during normal walking conditions. Experiments on able-bodied human subjects demonstrate reduced quadriceps activation with orthosis assistance during lifting-lowering, sit-to-stand, and stair climbing.

    "ip_description": "A powered knee-ankle device which produces a high torque without a high-ratio transmission. Uses low ratio transmission that allows patients to actively contribute to their joint movements. Employs frameless components and lightweight materials to aid mobility and ease of use. Physical training is often needed for patients to relearn how to walk after a stroke, though finite medical resources limit the frequency and availability of those interventions. To address these shortcomings, researchers have investigated powered lower-limb rehabilitation orthoses to relieve the repetitive and physically tasking duties of therapists, as well as to improve patient recovery efficacy. Currently, most lower limb rehabilitation orthoses are stationary and only available in a small number of hospitals, due to their high cost and large size. Therefore, personal mobile lower-limb orthoses that can be used in the clinic or at home would be desirable for purposes of rehabilitating this patient group. Existing mobile powered, lower-limb orthosis devices suffer from limitations such as output torque, complex system architecture, bulky size, and limited force control bandwidth. Due to the high torque requirements of lower-limb joints, a need exists to increase the torque density of powered orthoses to provide enough output torque within an acceptable weight. Researchers have invented an orthosis which utilizes a novel, powered knee-ankle device that produces a high output torque without a high-ratio transmission while providing precise torque control and backdrivability without series elastic components. The modular actuator of the orthosis is designed with a torque dense motor and a custom low-ratio transmission (24:1) to provide mechanical transparency to the user, allowing them to actively contribute to their joint kinematics during gait training. The 4.88 kg orthosis utilizes frameless components and light materials, such as aluminum alloy and carbon fiber, to reduce its mass. A human subject experiment demonstrates accurate torque control with high output torque during stance and low backdrive torque during swing at fast walking speeds. Results of experiments using the device confirm that high torque output during stance phase and low backdrive torque during swing phase can be achieved without using a clutch or variable transmission. The distributed low-ratio transmission is designed to reduce the mechanical impedance and allow the user to easily move their joints. Overall, this device reveals that backdrivability, precise torque control, high torque output, and light weight can be achieved in a powered orthosis without the high cost and complexity of variable transmissions, clutches, and/or series elastic components.",

The use of conventional passive prostheses after lower-limb loss results in gait that is slower, less stable, and less energy efficient than able-bodied locomotion. Passive prostheses aim to alleviate the effects of amputation using mechanisms such as springs, cams, and dampers to mimic normative gait patterns. However, passive prostheses are limited in functionality due to the fact that such mechanisms can only dissipate energy that the user introduces. Although these passive devices restore some functionality, amputees are typically left with an asymmetric gait. Moreover, most devices are designed for level-ground walking conditions and do not adequately facilitate tasks such as sit-to-stand or stair ascent/descent. Powered prostheses can actively inject energy and therefore have greater capability to restore mobility and quality of life to those who live with the loss of a limb. A great amount of research has gone into the design and control of powered prosthetic limbs, resulting in several prosthetic devices that implement a variety of actuation schemes. Rigid, or non-backdrivable actuators have recently been implemented in order to reduce the size and weight of the prosthesis, while other prosthetic legs implement actuators with low backdrivability, or high impedance. This approach can cause painful impact forces on the residual limb after extended use, and the requirement for active control of the knee swing results in higher energy consumption and reduced battery life. A need exists for a new prosthetic leg which optimizes functioning and energy use. Researchers have developed a powered knee-ankle prosthetic leg that implements high-torque actuators with low-reduction transmissions. The transmission is coupled with a high-torque, low-speed motor to create an actuator with low mechanical impedance and high backdrivability. This style of actuation presents several possible benefits over modern actuation styles in emerging robotic prosthetic legs, which include free-swinging knee motion, compliance with the ground, negligible unmodeled actuator dynamics, less acoustic noise, and power regeneration. A free-swinging knee joint allows for a more natural gait, while reducing the power requirements of the actuator during swing phase. Energy sharing phases of gait such as mid-stance, where the ankle regenerates energy while the knee demands it, can lead to longer periods of untethered operation, which is critical for robotic legs in consumer applications. Benchtop tests establish that both joints can be backdriven by small torques (~1-3 N-m) and confirm the small, reflected inertia. Impedance control tests prove that the intrinsic impedance and unmodeled dynamics of the actuator are sufficiently small to control joint impedance without torque feedback or lengthy tuning trials. Walking experiments validate performance under the designed loading conditions with minimal tuning. The implementation of biological joint impedances can also promote natural compliance with the ground and provide smoother touchdown impacts, which can in turn improve efficiency of the system and comfort for the user. Finally, the regenerative abilities, low friction, and small reflected inertia of the presented actuators reduced power consumption and acoustic noise compared to state-of-the-art powered legs.",

    "ip_description": "Nanoparticle compositions of two or more agents for chemoprevention of cancers. Useful for decreased recurrence of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). May inhibit progression of oral intraepithelial neoplasm (OIC) into true neoplasms. Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity affects up to 50,000 patients in the United States each year, and surgical excision with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, as needed, can cause significant side effects while still yielding significant rates of local recurrence. About one-third of these patients die from the effects of locally recurrent tumors, especially in the setting of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) neoplasms that do not associate with the prognostically favorable human papilloma virus infection. OSCC tumors commonly arise from the malignant progression of precursor lesions such as oral intraepithelial neoplasia (OIN). About 85% of OIN lesions transform to true neoplasms over time, and 30% of completely resected OIN abnormalities recur following surgery. Attempts to improve clinical outcomes in this setting with single agent chemopreventative trials have resulted in disappointingly low success rates with unacceptably high side effect risks. As such, a need exists to identify new chemoprotective strategies to help prevent the recurrence of OSCC tumors and to also diminish the risk for progression of OIC to OSCC neoplasms. Researchers have discovered nanoparticle compositions which may be used for chemoprevention of cancers, such as oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tumors. The nanoparticle composition is comprised of a Janus particle which combines at least two chemopreventative agents, at least one of which is selected from sources including freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB), a synthetic vitamin A analogue, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and an anti-interleukin 6 agent. The compositions may be delivered orally with a low risk of side effects, or they may alternatively be administered in an oral rinse, troche, topical gel, or mucoadhesive patch formulation. The agents may be administered either with the goal of preventing recurrence of a treated OSCC or inhibiting the progression of a precancerous lesion into a neoplasm. The invention may alternatively provide protection against the formation of periodontal disease.",

Leads to axon elongation and increased myelination after spinal cord injuries. Spinal cord injuries affect about 250,000 people per year worldwide, and the results of this damage can cause loss of tissue function, paralysis, or even death. There are no viable clinical treatment options for repairing spinal cord injuries, though the creation of biocompatible 'bridges' with multiple porous channels has yielded directional spinal cord growth in animal models. However, the current configuration of tissue regeneration bridges must be pre-formed into a desired shape that cannot be easily modified to fit a patient's specific injury. Also, the physical properties of bridges have not been successfully designed to match those of the spinal cord. While disc fusion procedures can be performed as an alternative method to try to provide a stable environment for the spinal cord tissue to heal on its own, the results have been suboptimal. So, a need exists to devise an improved approach to support tissue regeneration after spinal cord injury. Researchers have invented a highly porous tissue regeneration scaffold that is constructed from a composite of hydrogel tubes, and which provides the uniaxial support required for directional tissue regeneration following spinal cord injury. A two-step polymerization process forms hydrogel microspheres that are then cross-linked to form tubes that gather to form tertiary structures specific to the geometry of the target tissue. This novel approach involves small scale tubules which are less than one millimeter in diameter, thereby providing flexibility that permits the regenerated tissues to conform to the unique size and shape of the patient's site of injury. Additionally, these tube composites are specifically designed to match the appropriate biophysical cues of the spinal cord, including its viscoelasticity. Studies in a rat injury model showed significantly improved spinal cord growth when compared to existing bridge structures, including axon elongation and increased myelination. This scaffold design can easily be modified for tissue regeneration in other tissues, including both musculoskeletal and cardiovascular tissue.",

A microporous polymer scaffold that facilitates generation of 3-D islet-like structures. Creates structures that are clinically transferrable into anatomic sites such as peritoneal fat. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that affects nearly 20 million people worldwide. True type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic Beta-cells, leaving patients unable to regulate their blood glucose levels. T1D typically commonly manifests during childhood and leaves those who are afflicted reliant on insulin pumps or daily injections for the duration of their lives. These patients face demanding lifestyle changes include consistent blood sugar monitoring, real-time insulin dose adjustments based upon the results, and consideration of the effects of factors such as food intake, mood, and physical activity on blood sugar levels. Ongoing research efforts have involved transplantation of pancreatic tissues from cadavers, though this approach may be hindered by the need for repeated infusions, a limited supply of donor tissue, and the requirement for long-term immunosuppression to prevent rejection. Stem cell-derived pancreatic Beta-cells represent a replenishable source of insulin-producing tissue that may circumvent the shortage of donor tissue, though limitations of this strategy have included a low efficiency and consistency of Beta-cell maturation as well as a need to transplant at non-clinically anatomic sites to achieve optimal differentiation. As such, a need exists for improved culture and transplantation methods to bring Beta cell technology to T1D patients. Researchers have invented a method for improved differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPS) into functional Beta-cells through an approach that creates a specialized microporous polymer scaffold that has been optimized to promote efficient Beta-cell maturation. The scaffolds are comprised of microporous polymers (250-450uM) with a structure and pore size that promotes a high insulin yield. Additionally, the scaffolds can be coated with extracellular matrix (ECM) components which mimic the in vivo pancreatic environment. Cells are seeded onto the scaffold and cultured in vitro for weeks to initiate the differentiation process towards a Beta-cell lineage. The architecture of the scaffold protects the cells and facilitates the generation of a 3D islet-like structures. The Beta-cells produce insulin in response to a glucose challenge, thereby demonstrating that they are functional. The islet-like structures can be transplanted into clinically translatable sites such as the peritoneal fat to restore insulin production and reverse insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Moving forward, in vivo studies using animal models can be carried out to assess Beta-cell survival, insulin production, and the ability to be triggered by glucose blood levels.",

The chemical chaperone 4BPA can permit proper folding and therefore exportation of collagen IV. May be capable of delivery to at risk patients when they are young, or even in utero. Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) is an autosomal dominant blood vessel (BV) and lymphatic vessel (LV) disorder that results from combined germline and somatic mutations of the RASA1 gene in BV endothelial (BEC) and LV endothelial cells (LEC). While BV and LV lesions are commonly present at birth, they may develop throughout childhood and even into early adulthood. CM-AVM is characterized by cutaneous CM with one-third of patients also having fast-flow vascular lesions, which may become life-threatening depending upon their anatomic location. LV abnormalities may cause lymphedema, chylothorax, or chylous ascites in a smaller number of these patients. While some genetic predispositions such as mutations of the RASA1 gene are known to correlate with the incidence of CM-AVM, a robust knowledge of this disorder remains unclear. So, a need exists to further understand the pathogenesis of and potential corresponding treatment avenues for patients with CM-AVM. Researchers have discovered in a mouse model that blood vessel (BV) and lymphatic vessel (LV) lesions in capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) arise as a consequence of an inability of blood vessel endothelial cells (BEC) and lymph vessel endothelial cells (LEC) to export collagen IV. Collagen IV is an essential component of vascular basement membranes, and the inventors found that administration of the chemical chaperone 4-phenyl butyrate (4BPA) can restore the ability of BEC and LEC to export collagen IV, thereby preventing the development of lesions associated with CM-AVM. The mechanism increasing collagen IV exportation relates to its ability to more properly fold and release from endothelial cells in the presence of 4BPA. One could envision this type of treatment being administered to a disease carrier of any age, even potentially being given in utero. This novel approach therefore shows promise in the research and treatment of patients with CM-AVM.",

A zebrafish phenotype which accumulates uroporphyrin and suffers impaired bone development. Serves as a research model that suggests retinoids as a potential treatment for CEP. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is the rarest type of porphyria, with a prevalence of less than 1000 in the United States. The condition commonly presents in infancy, though it may appear at any time of life. Its symptoms include severe skin photosensitivity which may lead to blistering, scarring, and increased hair growth on the face and back of hands. The cumulative manifestations of photosensitivity and skin infections may come to eventually cause the loss of fingers and facial features. Additional signs and symptoms of the disease may include reddish discoloration of the teeth, reddish-colored urine, and anemia. CEP is an autosomal recessive disease that causes a defect in the synthesis of heme in the red blood cells of the bone marrow, leading to a buildup of porphyrin and its precursors. Currently there is no specific treatment for CEP besides bone marrow transplantation, so a need exists for methods by which to more extensively study and treat this disease. Researchers have developed a zebrafish model that phenocopies features of congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP). Uroporphyrin accumulates in the bones of these zebrafish and lead to impaired bone development, much the same as occurs in humans afflicted with this condition. Additional investigations in vitro have shown that uro-I exposure to an osteoblast-like cell line yields decreased mineralization, aggregated bone matrix proteins, activated endometrial stress, and disrupted autophagy. Using high-throughput drug screening, the researchers identified acitretin, a second-generation retinoid, and showed that it reduces uro-I accumulation and its deleterious effects on bones. Results also suggest that another retinoid, tretinoin, showed similar beneficial effects for clearing porphyrin in zebrafish. These findings provide a new CEP experimental model and identify the use of retinoids as potential, repurposed therapeutic agent for the condition.",

Furthers the research and implementation of new methods for chemical synthesis reactions. Chemical building blocks, or platform chemicals, form the base for more complex products through transformation such as the creation of polymers from monomers. The generation of novel chemicals or novel chemical synthesis reactions is crucial to developing new pharmaceutical or industrial products. The modulation of molecular properties with chemical synthesis is most often achieved by using multiple building blocks, which can be coupled to a core molecule using popular chemical transformations. Two commonly utilized methodologies for chemical transformations are amide coupling and Suzuki coupling, the latter of which is a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling used in organic synthesis. Still, many more theoretical coupling possibilities may exist for particular building blocks, and one may envision an approach that utilizes the same building blocks with a variety of different transformations rather than seeking out different building blocks. A need exists to explore these alternative transformations in an effort to develop a wider variety of new methods for chemical synthesis. Researchers at the University of Michigan have invented a method called \u201a\u00c4\u00f2reaction cartography\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 which identifies all of the possible combinations that could theoretically arise from the linking of two chemical building blocks. This approach defines hundreds of ways that building blocks may be linked, revealing transformations that are currently unknown but mechanically plausible. The inventors aim to merge traditional chemical synthesis reactions with high throughput techniques and data science to accelerate the discovery of novel chemical transformations. The generation of novel chemicals or uncovering new reaction schemes for chemical synthesis is an essential step to developing new pharmaceutical or industrial products. For instance, whereas an amine and carboxylic acid are typically coupled via an amide coupling, and this sole transformation makes up nearly one third of all reactions used to invent pharmaceuticals, the inventors have identified hundreds of other novel ways to couple the same amine and carboxylic acid building blocks. The acceleration of the discovery of novel chemical transformations will not only improve the basic science of understanding chemical synthesis reactions but may also be of great interest for a wide variety of commercial applications, including the development of novel pharmaceuticals, fuels, paints, industrial materials, plastics, agrochemicals, fragrances, or healthcare products.",

    "ip_description": "Production of a novel recombinant human CPS1 (rCPS1) to treat liver injury. Shows efficacy in vitro in human and mouse cells as well as mouse models in vivo. May diminish the need for liver transplant caused by situations such as acetaminophen toxicity. Acute liver failure (ALF) affects about 2000 patients per year in the United States, with drug-induced events being the most common cause. More than 100,000 cases of acetaminophen poisoning occur each year, and its deleterious effects on the liver may only be limited by the use of N-acetylcysteine if initiated in an appropriate time frame. In severe circumstances, ALF may become so severe as to require liver transplantation in an attempt to prevent death. The enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS1) is critical in controlling the urea cycle, a sequence of biochemical reactions that take place in the liver to process excess nitrogen that is generated through protein breakdown by the body. CPS1 is secreted into the bloodstream following acute liver injury and may serve as a potential prognostic marker for ALF due to its specific expression in the liver and its short half-life in the serum compared to other enzymes. CPS1 is the first and rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes ammonia detoxification to urea, and its deficiency belongs to a class of autosomal recessive genetic diseases referred to as urea cycle disorders. Poorly functioning or absent CPS1 causes nitrogen to accumulate in the blood steam in the form of toxic ammonia rather than urea which can be excreted by the kidneys. Current treatment options for urea cycle disorders are limited, so a need exists for new methods to correct for dysfunctions in CPS1. Researchers at the University of Michigan have produced recombinant human CPS1 (rCPS1) as a potential treatment for liver injury. The inventors created rCPS1 by cloning the genetic sequence into a baculovirus expression system and purified it through the use of a standard laboratory protein purification protocol. This purified rCPS1 was tested in vitro using cell cultures with mouse or human macrophages as well as in vivo by intravenous injection into mice. In cell culture, the rCPS1 increased hepatic macrophage numbers and phagocytic activity in a manner that is associated with wound healing and tissue repair. Administration of rCPS1 in mice prevented liver damage caused by acetaminophen while also protecting against liver damage when given therapeutically following liver injury. Thus, recombinant rCPS1 holds potential as a novel treatment for ALF and CPS1 deficiency to help diminish the need for liver transplantation. Additionally, the technology holds potential as a research tool to further delineate the physiological role of CPS1 in liver protection. CPS1 may therefore have utility if given parenterally to prevent acute tissue injury in the liver and possibly other tissue.",

    "ip_description": "A novel improvement of a therapeutic method to aid smoking cessation. A cofactor CycN that increases the turnover rate of NicA2 to decrease nicotine reaching the brain. Recognition and isolation of mutated NicA2 variants that may also improve nicotine inhibition. Tobacco use has long been correlated with potentially serious health consequences, leading to nearly 20% of annual deaths in the United States. Nicotine addiction serves as the primary reason that people are unable to discontinue tobacco use, in spite of the availability of smoking cessation aids that deliver nicotine by other routes such as gum, patches, and lozenges. The success of these existing supportive methods leading to the desired goal of smoking cessation rarely reach above 1.5-2 times greater than efforts undertaken in their absence. Nicotine holds impressive addictive properties, and there exist few other pharmaceuticals that modulate nicotine receptors in the brain and which could therefore serve as therapeutic agents. One new approach to treatment is the use of a nicotine degrading enzyme, nicotine oxidoreductase (NicA2), to intercept nicotine in the bloodstream and prevent its passage into the brain. NicA2 is a protein produced in bacteria that has been shown to prevent nicotine cravings when given to rats. Unfortunately, the positive effects of Nic2A would require a prohibitively high dose to serve as feasible treatment option in humans, due to the low rate of activity of this agent in the bloodstream. So, a need exists for a method to increase the metabolic turnover rate of Nic2A in patients seeking smoking cessation. Researchers have invented a method to address the slow turnover rate and high level of nicotine oxidoreductase (NicA2) required to treat nicotine addiction, providing an improved therapeutic approach to aid smoking cessation. Though the slow turnover rate of NicA2 results from a rate limiting step whereby it reacts with molecular oxygen, this innovation provides a means by which to increase the speed of NicA2 turnover 10,000-fold by co-administration of a novel cytochrome c cofactor (CycN). Additionally, the invention utilizes a screening approach to detect mutated variants of NicA2 in vitro that are capable of bypassing the need for CycN co-administration while increasing turnover rate. Through the use of a novel genetic selection process, the investigators were able to screen through mutated variants of NicA2 in a very high-throughput growth assay. This approach permitted screening of millions of mutations for variants that perform better than wild-type NicA2, which would then be more suitable for use as treatment. A pathway might also exist for creation of mutated variants of NicA2 to increase the intrinsic ability of this enzyme to react with O2, increasing the in vitro turnover rate without the need for additional cofactors. Overall, the invention provides a promising approach for fostering smoking cessation and decreasing the diseases which result from tobacco use.",

The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the need for rapidly deployable interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped, single stranded RNA beta-coronavirus that leads to flu-like symptoms, and which may progress in severity to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart arrhythmias, cerebrovascular accidents, and death. In consideration of therapeutic agents for this illness, the repurposing of existing antiviral therapies holds promise in the management of COVID-19. The use of remdesivir, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of a nucleoside inhibitor developed for Ebola virus treatment, has yielded positive results after its transitioned use against the SARS-CoV2 virus. The benefits of repurposing existing drugs include known safety profiles, established supply chains, and an abbreviated timeframe needed for development. It is possible to identify the pathways and the processes underlying infection through morphological profiling, permitting targeted screening focused on a specific biological process or targeting of host processes that limit viral infections. The resulting identification of multiple anti-viral mechanisms allows for the rational design of drug combinations. Researchers have identified compounds with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 through a fully developed, high-content screening pipeline that screens previously develop drugs against the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Initial in vitro screening passes identified 132 compounds which show moderately dose-responsive anti-viral behavior, six of which were previously known to have anti-viral activity. This screening process included high content imaging which characterizes the mechanism of action of the effective drugs. The inventors leveraged machine learning approaches to create an assay metric that accurately and robustly identifies features that predict antiviral efficacy and mechanism of action. Additionally, approved drugs served as chemical probes to understand the biology of viral infection and make new associations between COVID-19 and molecular pathways that influence pathogenesis of the disease. This approach enables the identification of multiple anti-viral mechanisms, allowing for the rational future design of drug combinations or, conversely, revealing drugs that exacerbate infectivity or are associated with cytotoxicity. The assay also permits evaluation of drug combinations, or cocktails, which may hold synergistic efficacy against the virus. This approach is versatile and can even identify emergent properties of the infection as well as novel phenotypes that can be perturbed through chemical inhibition. Overall, this high content bioimaging-based assay has proven to be highly robust and informative and has already led to the identification of FDA approved drugs that can be rapidly translated into clinical use.",

Provides a potential treatment for COVID alone or in combination with other agents. The global pandemic of COVID-19 resulted from an acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has similarities to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-C0V). The viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 has been sequenced to enable diagnostic testing, epidemiologic tracking, and development of preventative and therapeutic strategies. Lactoferrin is a single chain metal binding glycoprotein which may bind to receptors on cell types such as monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, and brush-border cells. Lactoferrin serves as an essential growth factor for both B and T lymphocytes as well as being involved in a wide array of other functions related to host primary defense mechanisms. These mechanisms suggest a strong biological plausibility for the anti-viral efficacy of lactoferrin. As such, a need exists for research into the potential effectiveness of lactoferrin against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Researchers have discovered that lactoferrin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 viral infection in human cells. This glycoprotein, which is naturally present in secretory fluids such as milk, saliva, tear, and nasal secretions, showed viral entry inhibition at various concentrations and was not associated with any discernible toxicity. The antiviral activity of lactoferrin in these studies related to its binding to SARS-CoV-2 and cells while preventing viral spike attachment to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the human cells. This interaction therefore blocked entry of the virus into the host cells. The invention suggests a pathway for treatment of adult respiratory distress syndrome resulting from COVID-19 infection through intravenous administration alone or in combination of other agents, such as remdesivir. Additionally, the investigators believe that oral lactoferrin may be considered for the symptomatic treatment of COVID-19 related diarrhea. The apparent efficacy, low toxicity profile, and ease of production of lactoferrin suggest that additional trials need to be undertaken for this viral infection.",

    "ip_description": "Novel use of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) to predict outcomes. A useful biomarker for those suffering coronary artery disease, heart failure, and kidney disease. Can be used to determine the utility of specific treatments for these patient groups. The clinical management of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is made more complex because the significant prognostic heterogeneity among patients with seemingly similar disease processes creates difficulties predicting benefits versus risks of specific interventions. Serum biomarker research in CVD patients focuses on ways to increase success in the screening, accurate diagnosis, and prognostic predictability of this group. Any useful new prognostic biomarker must show high specificity, low variability between patients, provision of information beyond existing markers, and a means by which to evaluate response to therapy. The transition of a biomarker from prognostic to predictive connotes its ability to tailor therapy to a specific patient\u2019s needs. Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a protein measured in blood that is thought to reflect inflammation and activation in the immune system. As a signaling molecule, suPAR is thought to potentially cause illnesses where inflammation plays a role, so a need exists to further study this molecule and its predictiveness of disease processes. Researchers at the University of Michigan have discovered that soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels in blood are strongly predictive of clinical outcomes in various patient populations including those suffering from myocardial infarction, heart failure, renal dysfunction, and death. Blood levels of suPAR vary greatly in patients with heart disease, and their values can aid clinicians in treatment and management decisions that might otherwise prove challenging. For example, patients with severe coronary artery disease and high suPAR levels may benefit from coronary bypass graft surgery rather than coronary stenting. Additionally, the measurement of suPAR levels in patients with stable coronary artery disease could identify those who would benefit from treatment with statins or immunomodularity therapy. A similar approach could identify heart failure patients with concomitant kidney dysfunction to determine which should receive intervention with mechanical circulatory assist devices or be placed on a heart transplantation list. In general, the measurement of suPAR levels could determine which hospitalized patients are at a higher risk for worsened cardiovascular disease, thereby allowing for appropriate resource allocations to those who would benefit the most after discharge.",

    "ip_description": "Description of glioblastoma multiforme metabolic activity from a single measurement. Machine learning that estimates tumor behavior from one 13C infusion measurement. Provides a novel method to measure tumor behavior and treatment response. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor in humans with a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. The standard treatment for GBM involves surgical resection, when feasible, as well as temozolomide chemotherapy delivered concurrently with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The cellular makeup within GBM tumors shows heterogeneity that correlates with resistance to EBRT, with data revealing that radiation resistant GBM tumors exhibit higher levels of molecules that promote processes that allow cancer cells to adapt to changing microenvironments and to proliferate. The metabolic flux of cancerous tissue has historically been evaluated by mass spectrometry measurements of infused radioactive carbon isotopes such as carbon-13 (13C) to assess the effects of influence of these molecules. Given that existing measures are commonly limited in both number and time, a need exists for new methods to extrapolate the metabolic behavior of tumor cells from a limited number of data points. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a method to utilize stable isotope infusions to quantify rates of metabolic activity from single measurements in mouse models of human brain tumors. While historical measures of tumor metabolic activity require multiple assessments over different timepoints, this invention employs machine learning models based on existing data that can determine metabolic activity from a single measurement. This invention can therefore measure the metabolic flux of tumors using 13C infusion and single time point analysis. Because most patient tumors can only provide a solitary metabolic measurement representing their activity at the time of biopsy or surgical resection, the development this model to estimate metabolic activity based on a single data point provides a novel means by which to assess tumor behavior. The information obtained from this approach can be used by clinicians when they choose which metabolic inhibitors to prescribe for their patients with glioblastoma multiforme, such as the delivery of agents which inhibit guanosine triphosphate and may therefore negate the radiation-resistant properties of tumors rich in this this nucleotide. The further study of this novel technique may provide a wealth of approaches for GBM treatment algorithms.",

Treatment prospects include bladder cancer and other c-Src influenced neoplasms. Protein kinases (PK) are enzymes that normally add phosphates to other molecules such as sugars and proteins. PK actions are critical to cellular functions, as evidenced by the fact that some of them remain highly conserved in their structure across all eukaryotic cells. More than four hundred diseases have been linked to aberrant activity of protein kinases, including abnormal inflammation, diabetes, and cancer. The identities of several specific protein kinase dysfunctions have been elucidated, though pharmacologic inhibition of these enzymes has not uniformly led to clinical responses. Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have recently emerged as a compelling technology to degrade target proteins using a small molecule entity. PROTACs show a unique mechanism of action which can be used to address resistance to existing therapies, though a need exists for additional research to define the role of protein kinases more fully in diseases such as cancer. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a series of efficacious small molecule degraders that serve as kinase inhibitors, and which are more active than existing agents. These novel proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTECS) are potent degraders for kinases that act as proto-oncogenes, such as Abl, p38, and c-Src. The optimized PROTACs significantly degrade c-Src and are potent in cell culture against a panel of bladder and breast cancer cell lines. In vivo, the PROTAC compounds can be delivered through intravenous or intraperitoneal routes, and an oral formulation is being developed. Beyond the potential use of this agent for treatment, further study using proteomics and genomic sequencing may provide an understanding of those processes that lead to acquired resistance, therefore aiding development of companion drugs. The goal will be to develop pharmacologically active compounds that degrade c-Src and prevent progression of MIBC and other cancers that depend upon deregulation of c-Src for growth.",

Incorporation of biomarker CD44 measurement in extracellular matrix with BRIM scores. Statistical optimization analysis (SOA) to augment prognostic powers of BRIM. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a pre-cancerous breast disease that commonly affects women and which may recur after treatment or even progress to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Still, increasing evidence suggests that many women with DCIS may be best served with active surveillance rather than aggressive treatment, depending upon the aggressiveness of the affected cells. Ongoing research has focused on the best means by which to classify the cases which deserve treatment, and researchers previously described a protocol for doing such through use of biomarker ratio imaging microscopy (BRIM) on tissue biopsies. The BRIM approach involves use of a fluorescent biomarkers which correlate to opposing sides of one attribute in order to give a high contrast image of a specific cellular characteristic. Any one of several biomarker pairs can be used to assess multiple breast cancer properties with the same instrumentation. Further advancements in data analysis and research into BRIM could allow for even greater statistical differentiation power, more confident assignments in tissue diagnosis, and the ability to use BRIM to improve genomic testing. Researchers at the University of Michigan have invented a method to improve the success rates for prognostic predictions of women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast through incorporation of a biomarker measurement to the existing biomarker ratio imaging microscopy (BRIM) technology. The inventors discovered that a non-kinase transmembrane proteoglycan named CD44 may be present in the extracellular matrix of DCIS samples in a distribution that can be incorporated with BRIM measurements to improve the ability to predict prognosis in this setting. While the biological process causing the presence of CD44 in these areas is unknown, the researchers postulate that the leakiness of tumor blood vessels and poor drainage causes increased pressure that leads slow-diffusing proteins to become broadly distributed. A composite BRIM score calculated from this statistical analysis of CD44 concentrations in the duct and extracellular matrix increases sensitivity and specificity of the existing BRIM test through reducing noise in the data. Statistical optimization analysis (SOA) is employed to filter data in order to minimize natural variability in gene expression and to limit the associated errors in calculations. The improved prognostic predictability created by augmentation of the BRIM assessment provides a more powerful means by which to separate out patients with high- versus low-risk DCIS.",

    "ip_description": "A novel method to predict recurrence risks of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Measures intracellular location of biomarkers to determine likelihood of recurrence. May lead to a test which can offer women the chance to forego aggressive treatment. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a pre-cancerous condition of the breast in which abnormal cells are limited to the lumen of the milk ducts of the breast but have not spread through the duct walls to become infiltrating ductal cancer. Though DCIS treatment commonly involves surgery and radiotherapy, growing evidence suggests that delineation of those women with either high or low risk for disease recurrence could spare some of the side effect risks from treatment. Unfortunately, existing technology cannot accurately predict recurrence risks for women with DCIS, so the choice between observation alone and aggressive treatment remains difficult for patients and clinicians. So, in spite of improvements in screening for DCIS and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), a need exists for better testing to define the subset of women with DCIS who may safely forego treatment and instead choose active surveillance of their condition. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a method to predict recurrence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) based upon subcellular localization of phosphofructokinase type L (PFKL), phosphofructokinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase type 4 (PFKFB4), and other biomarkers. Retrospective review of DCIS pathology specimens showed that PFKL and PFKFB4 were found in ductal epithelial cell nucleoli from samples of women who did not experience a disease recurrence, while those same two markers were located near the plasma membrane in samples from those patients who did suffer recurrent disease. The presence of PFKL and PFKB4 at the apical surface of epithelial cells in recurrent samples suggests that carbohydrates are being harvested from the ducts\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 luminal spaces as an energy source. Machine learning can be used to categorize differences in the cellular location of PFKL, PFKB4, and phosphorylated glucose transporter protein type 1 (GLUT1) to predict recurrence risks with results that predicted 39% true negatives, 49% true positives, 12% false positives, and no false negatives. This high degree of fidelity may lead to an accurate diagnostic test to classify DCIS patients as having high or low recurrence risk.",

    "ip_description": "A novel antifibrotic agent that potently inhibits MRTF-mediated extracellular signaling. Directly treats the causes of fibrosis rather than just addressing its symptoms. May prove useful for patients with scleroderma, IPF, liver cirrhosis, and Crohn's disease. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and scleroderma are two common fibrosis related disorders that cause progressive symptoms and may ultimately lead to death. IPF creates shortness of breath and cough predominately in older patients, while scleroderma commonly affects the skin and underlying tissues in younger patients, though it may eventually come to involve internal organs. The current treatment of IPF includes either nintedanib (which targets growth factor pathways) or pirfenidone (which inhibits collagen synthesis and reduces fibroblast proliferation). Each of these medicines suffer from the risk of significant adverse effects. Similarly, anti-inflammatory agents may lessen the symptoms of scleroderma, though with side effect risks that increase with prolonged use. So, a new therapeutic avenue is needed that decreases the fibrosis associated with these illnesses and which has an acceptable side effect profile. Researchers have invented an inhibitor of myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF), which is known to play a crucial function in diseases that cause fibrosis. The inhibition of MRTF serum response factor (SRF) signaling decreases lung fibrosis, and inhibition of a MRTF transcription pathway involving both Rho GTPase and SRF has the potential to treat scleroderma. This novel approach directly treats fibrosis related illnesses rather than just addressing their symptoms, and they hold promise for diminished side effects when compared to existing agents. One study using the MRTF inhibitor showed decreased fibrosis and reversal of weight loss in a preclinical model of lung fibrosis. This class of drugs may also prove effective in addressing other ailments such as liver cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, and any other maladies that cause inappropriate fibrosis.",

    "ip_description": "A new method for evaluating cellular signaling in the bud tip during lung development. Discovery that inhibition of TGFb and stimulation of BMP yield AT2-like cells in vivo. In vivo pathways that can be leveraged for production of AT2-like organoids in vitro. Embryologic development of lung tissue begins about 5 months after conception when a lung bud begins to separate from the foregut. As the lung bud begins to separate into two distinct structures, specialized epithelial progenitors known as bud tip progenitors (BTPs) differentiate and give rise to all the cells in the tree-like network of epithelial tubes. BTPs undergo repeated bifurcations to give rise to the trachea as well as the bronchi and bronchioles. During the subsequent phase of development known as the canalicular stage, cells of the epithelial stalk region directly proximal to BTPs differentiate into alveolar type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) lineages. While the descendants of BTPs transition into airway or alveolar cells as influenced by environmental cues, the mechanisms promoting human alveolar differentiation are not fully characterized. A need exists for research to further define the cellular signaling pathways that promote alveolar differentiation in BTPs. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a method for using single cell RNA-sequencing and computational approaches to interrogate cellular signaling in the bud tip during lung development. The investigators discovered that transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) exert opposing effects on human alveolar differentiation. Simultaneous inhibition of TGFB and stimulation of BMP signaling cause bud tip progenitors (BTPs) to efficiently differentiate into alveolar type 2 (AT2)-like cells in vitro. The resulting AT2-like organoids can be expanded for more than 100 days in appropriate media, they express mature AT2 markers, and they also secrete lamellar bodies. Comparison of TGFb/BMP induction with existing methods for generating AT2 cells confirmed specific gene expression patterns, induction efficiencies, and homogeneity of emergent cell types. The inventors therefore show that BMP and TGFb are important signaling pathways regulating nascent alveolar differentiation in vivo that can be leveraged for production of AT2-like organoids in vitro.",

    "ip_description": "A novel means by which to block the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Causes weight loss due to decreased numbers of fat cells in mice. Provides a means to study and treat patients with diabetes mellitus. Leptin is a hormone released by the body that helps to maintain normal weight and metabolic processes on a long-term basis. Blood levels of leptin correlate directly with percent body fat, and it regulates energy balance through influences on the brainstem and hypothalamus. Increased levels of body fat normally cause higher serum concentrations of leptin, though the body may eventually become resistant to leptin and negate its feedback effects on hunger. The resulting body fat dysregulation comes to create abnormalities in other metabolic functions such as maintenance of blood sugar levels. As such, a need exists for additional means by which to study and influence the behavior of leptin in patients with obesity and diabetes mellitus. Researchers have identified a novel means by which to block the activity of a histone named deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inside fat cells to improve the brain's ability to sense leptin, thereby decreasing obesity and its related health disorders such as diabetes in mice. Though the body normally becomes insensitive to leptin with increasing levels of obesity, the investigators found a way for mice to regain sensitivity to leptin and improve metabolic health. Mice treated with the HDAC6 inhibitor experienced weight loss due almost entirely from decreases in the amount of fat tissue with little corresponding change in lean muscle mass. HDAC6 inhibitors reduce food intake, fat mass, hepatic steatosis and improve systemic glucose homeostasis in an HDAC6-dependent manner. The treated mice were specifically noted to show improvements in glucose tolerance, indicating that they had become less likely to develop diabetes mellitus. Overall, this invention provides a basis by which further research may be undertaken to treat patients with obesity and diabetes.",

Effective against acute leukemia, solid cancers, and other diseases. Absent small and homeotic disks protein 1 homolog (ASH1L) is an enzyme that may be overexpressed in a variety of hematologic and solid tumors. The normal function of ASH1L appears to involve differentiation of embryonic stem cells during embryogenesis. Overexpression of this enzyme may correlate with shorter survival in patients with cancer, as has been described for patients with malignancies of the breast. Similarly, structural variations can be identified in the DNA near the ASH1L gene of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and inhibitors of ASH1L slow tumor cell proliferation. The role of ASH1L has been associated with illnesses besides neoplasms, including muscular dystrophy and liver fibrosis. As such, a need exists for further research into the role of ASH1L in disease with the goal of influencing any of its potential aberrant behaviors through the use of novel therapeutics. Researchers have invented ASH1L degraders that resulted from connecting ASH1L inhibitors with the E3 ubiquitin ligase inhibitor thalidomide. These small molecules directly target the SET domain of ASH1L. Once bound to the SET domain, the compounds described block the catalytic activity of ASHIL and downregulates the expression of target genes. The beneficial effects of the agent may be measured by a decrease in cell proliferation or viability, an increase in cell differentiation, a decrease in the levels of downstream targets of ASH1L activity, or a decrease in tumor volume. The pharmaceutical composition is formulated for oral intake, intravenous injection, or other systemic routes of administration. Alternatively, the agent may be injected directly into an organ or tissue in a sustained release formulation, or even within liposomes targeted to and taken up selectively by an organ.

    "ip_description": "A novel monoclonal antibody that affects the binding of CD318 to CD6 to enhance cancer cell death. An approach that is similar to, but distinct from, existing checkpoint inhibitor treatments. Suppresses autoimmunity and may therefore serve as a safer anti-cancer therapy. CD6 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is almost exclusively expressed by lymphocytes, including most mature T cells and about half of natural killer cells. CD6 functions to promote T-cell activation and proliferation, and it is also involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. CD318 is a ligand of CD6, and their interactions correlate with autoimmune diseases that affect the central nervous system and synovial lining of joints. Additionally, CD318 is known to be expressed by a variety of tissue cell types including many cancers. The expression of CD318 on cancer cells is distinct from other pathways which have been manipulated to derive checkpoint inhibitor therapies, a group of treatments that have revolutionized cancer immune therapy. While cancers respond with varying efficacy to checkpoint inhibition, many patients suffer autoimmune-related adverse events from these treatments. As such, additional targets are needed on cancer cells and lymphocytes that enhance immune cell elimination of tumors without engendering autoimmune toxicities through induction of lymphocyte self-reactivity. Researchers at the University of Michigan have described the use of a monoclonal antibody named UMCD6 that blocks the binding of CD318 to CD6 and enhances killing of cancer cells by lymphocytes. The scientists discovered that the use of antibody UMCD6 to CD318 augments the death of cell lines derived from breast, lung, and prostate cancers through direct effects on both CD8+ T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The cancer cell death fostered by this approach created a more robust effect than those from monoclonal antibody checkpoint inhibitors. UMCD6 also augmented in vivo killing by human peripheral blood lymphocytes of a human breast cancer line xenotransplanted into immunodeficient mice. This approach is analogous to the mechanism of existing cancer cell checkpoint inhibitor treatments, though these CD6/CD6 interactions potently suppress autoimmunity in several experimental systems and may therefore offer the potential for cancer treatments with a more favorable side effect profile. The safety of anti-CD6 monoclonal antibodies has been confirmed through their use in psoriasis treatments. Therefore, a CD6/CD6 ligand-directed approach to cancer treatment may be used independently or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors to prevent or reverse autoimmune effects of those agents.",

Co-adsorption of anti-human Fc anti IgG antibodies with lysine onto gold nanoparticles. Promotes the discovery and engineering of therapeutic antibodies in a wide array of conditions. Monoclonal antibodies are among the most successful biopharmaceuticals because of their ability to elicit potent immune responses and treat a wide array of human diseases. The interest in using antibodies as therapeutics has led to efforts to identify antibody variants with drug-like properties at the earliest stages of discovery in order to minimize problems that may be encountered later in the development process. It is particularly important to formulate antibody therapeutics as concentrated liquid suspensions with high stability and low viscosity. However, it remains challenging during early discovery to identify antibody candidates that will possess drug-like properties when concentrated by orders of magnitude later in the development process. Anti-human antibodies are commonly attached to gold nanoparticles in these types of assays, though these nanoparticles are not stable and readily aggregate in specific pH ranges. A need exists to create assays that function across a wide range of pH values and that successfully enable evaluation of potentially therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Researchers have developed an immunogold assay able to rapidly screening antibodies at extremely dilute concentrations while also being capable of identifying variants with favorable colloidal and viscoelastic properties when formulated at high concentrations. Their novel approach involves co-adsorption of anti-human Fc IgG antibodies with polylysine onto gold nanoparticles, following which the target human monoclonal antibodies are captured for intraparticle measurement of interactions via changes in oscillations of electron density (plasmons) of the immunogold conjugates. The polylysine both stabilizes the conjugates and increases their net positive charge, providing reliable measures of plasmon and viscosity. The assay is compatible with common histidine formulations and provides results that correlate well with dynamic light scattering measurements across a wide range of pH values.

A microenvironment that mimics tissue stiffness, remodeling, and inflammation in Grave's orbitopathy. Describes how GO results from changes in hypoxia inducible factor-2 alpha and lysyl oxidase. Thyroid eye disease (TED) is a condition in which the inflammation and fibrosis of fat tissues and muscles around the orbits cause irritation, swelling, bulging eye, double vision, and eventually, blindness. TED, also called as Grave's orbitopathy (GO), is most often associated with autoimmune hyperthyroidism (Grave's disease), and its prevalence is about 0.3% in the population. The pharmacological treatment for GO has been limited, and patients with progressive TED commonly need to undergo decompression surgeries in an effort to preserve vision. While the fibrotic and inflammatory tissue remodeling in GO is triggered by autoimmune processes, the mechanisms underlying the progressive tissue changes and inflammation remain poorly defined. As such, a need exists for further research into the pathogenesis of GO to provide further opportunities for development of therapeutic agents. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a three dimensional (3D) organoid model of thyroid eye disease (TED) which has subsequently facilitated discovery of a novel therapeutic target for Grave's orbitopathy (GO). A GO model was created through isolation of human orbital fibroblasts recovered from GO and non-GO patients following which the cells were placed in a hanging droplet culture to generate 3D organoids which recapitulated in vivo microenvironments that mimic the tissue stiffness, extracellular matrix remodeling, and inflammatory gene expression characteristics of GO. This 3D model exists in an architecture that more closely approximates conditions in the orbit than does a two-dimensional model, thereby allowing for results that better represent those in the in vivo state. The scientists demonstrated through the GO model that upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF2A) and the resulting induction of lysyl oxidase (LOX) correlate with fibrotic and inflammatory tissue damage and stiffness. Therefore, inhibition of HF2A or LOX activity should provide a means by which to develop therapeutic agents that effectively prevent and treat GO in affected patients.",

Prognostic score that improves risk stratification and provides new therapeutic targets. Renal cell carcinoma comprises about 4% of all newly diagnosed cancers in the United States and is most often treated with curative intent surgery. About 10% of patients present with locally advanced or metastatic tumor, and another 20% of patients treated for cure will suffer disease recurrence. Several genetic alterations have been associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common histologic subtype of kidney cancer. While remodeling of ccRCC cellular metabolism correlates with higher grade disease that presents with a more advanced stage and lower chances for survival, molecular profiling is not routinely carried out to assess prognosis or to aid selection of therapy. A need exists to improve the understanding of the molecular underpinnings of renal cell carcinoma cases to identify those critical pathways that lead to greater risks for disease recurrence. Researchers at the University of Michigan have discovered the synergistic prognostic impact of two known predictors of renal cell carcinoma progression, namely epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the cell cycle progression (CCP) score. EMT is a developmentally vital reversible process by which fully differentiated cells lose their epithelial features and acquire a migratory mesenchymal phenotype, while the CCP score has been shown to independently improve risk stratification of several other cancer types including those arising in the breast and prostate. The scientists performed differential expression gene (DEG) analysis on targeted RNA next-generation sequencing data from kidney cancer samples and documented a correlation with poorer progression free survival and disease specific survival through the combined measurement of these two factors. The predictive capabilities of this approach applied to both patients considered to have lower risk disease at presentation as well as those with known high-risk features, such as the presence of synchronous interior vena cava thrombus. The resulting prognostic score therefore provides the potential to improve risk stratification and provide potential novel therapeutic targets.",

Creates genetic marker panels that can identify at risk individuals and guide therapy. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a heritable and prevalent disease that has no effective treatments. NAFLD is caused by the deposition of excess fat in the liver and can lead to advanced liver diseases such as inflammation, fibrosis or cirrhosis, and hepatocellar carcinoma. The increased prevalence of obesity in developed countries has correlated with an increasing incidence of NAFLD. Greater than 90% of severely obese patients suffer from NAFLD, and their average lifespans are correspondingly shorter than non-obese subjects. Furthermore, while a causal relationship has not been proven, the presence of NAFLD corresponds to higher rates of dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. NAFLD is on pace to become the most common cause for liver transplantation in the United States, causing a great personal burden for patients and significant economic strain on the healthcare system. A need therefore exists to identify genetic variants which could provide early identification of and treatment for NAFLD. Researchers at the University of Michigan have identified genetic loci that predispose for the development of fatty liver diseases which are unrelated to alcohol intake. The scientists carried out a genome-wide meta-analysis of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients identified by imaging studies and medical diagnostic codes to reproducibly define the associations of genetic variations with this condition. The investigators identified 11 NAFLD associated variants, and they showed that the presence of these traits is more capable of predicting the onset of NAFLD than are measures of standard liver function tests. These markers permit further identification of susceptible individuals, classifies them into disease subtypes, and links them to the most appropriate treatments, irrespective of ancestry or gender.

The technology is critical for success in regenerative medicine, a specialty that seeks to replace tissues damaged by disease, trauma, or the sequelae of congenital illnesses. Two of the goals of regenerative medicine are to recreate the biochemical and physical complexities of the normal human extracellular matrix within engineered constructs.

Bioprinting involves precise layer-by-layer deposition of biomaterials and biological components to form structures critical to regenerative medicine.

Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed 3D-printable, acoustically responsive bioinks that enable fabrication of acoustically responsive scaffolds (ARSs) with precise micropatterned phase shift emulsions (PSEs) which optimize print fidelity. This novel process involves exposure of the printer's emulsion droplets to ultrasound which creates small gas bubbles in the hydrogel matrix to create a product that has improved tissue micromechanics and biological functioning. The improved alignment of fibrin fibers through the use of this approach likely contributed to its success. These bioprinted ASRs provide favorable properties compared to existing approaches, including the production of more complex geometries and therefore better personalized prints for use in regenerative medicine. This new form of bioprinting will likely aid in optimizing ARSs for a variety of therapeutic applications.",

    "ip_description": "A protocol for supplementing diets with resistant starch (RS) to affect the gut microbiome. One bacterium with specific types of pili bind resistant starch from potatoes. This probiotic decreases gut inflammation and promotes its barrier function. Bacteria that thrive as normal inhabitants of the human intestines comprise the gut microbiome and function to produce metabolites that are essential to health. The composition and activity of the gut microbiome are influenced heavily by intake of dietary fibers including Resistant Starch (RS), a plant polysaccharide that escapes degradation in the small intestine, but which can be metabolized by specialized bacteria in the colon. In addition to influencing the regularity of bowel movements, dietary fiber contains fermentable compounds that fuel the metabolism of gut microbes and promote health. The amount of fiber in a typical Western diet, less than half of the recommended amount, is therefore a public health concern. One strategy for addressing the shortcoming in dietary fiber is to supplement diets with purified preparations of plant fiber, such as resistant starch (RS). Unlike most processed starches, this crystalline form of starch is resistant to digestion by the a-amylases of mammals and most microbes. However, it can be cleaved by specialized bacteria of the gut microbiome that then grow by fermenting the released polysaccharides. However, the details of how bacteria in a turbulent environment like the gut capture insoluble substrates like RS are unclear, so a need exists for an improved understanding of these processes. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a protocol for supplementing diets with resistant starch (RS) which modulates composition and activity of the gut microbiome to foster normal homeostasis and decrease gut epithelium inflammation. The scientists discovered that some bifidobacteria produce extracellular appendages, or pili, which bind to RS from potatoes. The most responsive bacterium found in study subjects whose diets were supplemented with RS was Bifidobacterium adolescentis, which has a pilus required for attachment to RS granules. The diversity of the pilins in this strain of bacteria provides an ability to bind different substrates and ultimately occupy different niches in the human gut. Evidence suggests that B adolescentis trigger production of tryptophan-derived indole derivatives that can decrease inflammation and improve the barrier function of gut epithelium. The successful delivery of this probiotic would be as simple as providing oral intake of the bacteria attached to its food source, resistant starch in potatoes. Additional studies using this knowledge will be important to the development and use of matched combinations of prebiotic and probiotics to investigate gut health and its relationship to illnesses such as cancer and graft versus host disease.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of Michigan have mapped epithelial cells from the adult human esophagus and demonstrate that two-dimensional and three-dimensional organoids can be employed for modeling the complete epithelial layers, thereby enabling in vitro modeling of the human adult esophagus. The investigators created a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reference atlas of the cell types observed in the normal adult human esophagus, they established an ancestrally diverse biobank of in vitro esophagus tissue to interrogate homeostasis and injury, and they benchmarked those in vitro motels using the atlas. They were able to identify and validate several transcriptionally distinct cell classes in the native human adult esophagus, with four populations belonging to the epithelial layer, including basal, epibasal, early differentiating, and terminally differentiated-luminal cells. Given that multiple pediatric and adult esophageal diseases are known to exhibit gender and racial disparities in their incidence and presentation, the scientists have begun to develop a biobank of esophageal cell lines from across the diversity of the human population and from a wide range of healthy and diseased states. These cell lines will provide a means to better understand how genetic differences and ancestry may play a role in injury-repair or disease. This novel approach therefore provides detailed methods for the long-term culture of the human esophagus in vitro, provides an atlas of the adult human esophagus, and uses scRNA-seq data as a roadmap to benchmark in vitro cultured cells providing a detailed foundation for pursuing human esophagus research.",

Supports targeted destruction of leukemic stem cell populations. Epigenetics involves the regulation of cellular genetic expression without altering its DNA code. Polycomb proteins are important epigenetic factors that operate by repressing gene expression. These proteins are vital for the normal development of blood cells and have been shown to become dysregulated in hematologic malignancies. One protein aggregation, the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PCR1), normally regulates differentiation of stem cells but may fail this function in the setting of certain leukemias. Two proteins located in PCR1 are Bmi1 and Ring1B, the former of which serves as a proto-oncogene whose dysregulation correlates with leukemias that have a high resistance to chemotherapy agents. So, a need exists to improve the options for influencing the regulatory functions of PCR1. Researchers have invented small molecule inhibitors of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 via direct binding to the Ring1B-Bmi1 E3 ligase protein. These compounds display potent effects in cell models, specifically involving cell samples from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The mechanism of action for this innovation supports targeted destruction of leukemic stem cell populations by inducing their differentiation. The positive effects of these small molecule inhibitors have been confirmed through study of in vivo xenograft models where significant prevention of tumor growth was noted. As ongoing elucidation for the role of PCR1 complexes in driving various malignancies becomes more apparent, this class of inhibitors holds substantial promise in improving the targeting of cancer stem cells and chemotherapy resistant cancers.",

    "ip_description": "Two novel compounds that inhibit the MALT1 signaling pathway. Inhibition of both the scaffolding and proteolytic functions of MALT1. Wide-ranging applications for MALT1 driven tumors and autoimmune diseases. Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) is an intracellular signaling protein that serves an important role in both innate and adaptive immunity. MALT1 is essential for activation of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kappaB) which is a protein complex that controls DNA transcription, T-cell activation, cytokine production, and cellular responses to stress, cytokines, free radicals, and infections. NF-kappaB functions as both a structural, scaffold protein as well as proteolytic activity that cleaves proteins and influences cellular signaling. Incorrect regulation of NF-kappaB is linked to autoimmune diseases as well as the formation of specific types of B-cell lymphoma. Previous efforts to develop therapeutic MALT1 inhibitors have yielded compounds that only block its protease activity without influencing the scaffolding activity, leading to severe autoinflammation. As such, a need exists for development of agents that affect both functions of MALT1 as a strategy for treating neoplastic and inflammatory diseases. Researchers have discovered two novel compounds that are inhibitors of those portions of the MALT1 signaling pathway which are specifically deregulated in circumstances related to the formation of cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases. The inventors found two small molecule inhibitors that block the interaction between B-cell lymphoma 10 protein (BCL10) and MALT1, affecting the various components of the T- and B-cell immune responses. The resulting inhibition of the activities of MALT 1 and its downstream signaling functions cause a decrease secretion by B-cell lymphoma cells of interleukins 6 and 10. Since these compounds abrogate all MALT1 activity including protease and scaffolding activities, they may be significantly more efficacious and wide ranging in terms of therapeutic applications for MALT1 driven malignancies and overactive inflammatory diseases than other agents.",

    "ip_description": "A radiotherapy dose measurement method using combined radiation and acoustic imaging. Permits anatomical and functional imaging during a radiotherapy treatment. Allows improved dose delivery to tumor targets relative to adjacent normal tissues. Radiotherapy (RT) is recognized to be a highly conformal and effective treatment for many types of cancers and is the primary treatment modality for many locally advanced cancers. Radiation dose planning, quality assurance, and delivery methods have improved dramatically in recent years. Clinical dose measurement, or dosimetry, may involve the use of ion chambers, diodes, thermal dosimeters, or any one of several other methods. However, in spite of meticulous off-line treatment planning processes and the use of imaging during therapy to provide quality assurance, current dose delivery methods are limited due to geometric uncertainties caused by target deformations, organ motion, or function. Discrepancies can therefore be observed between planned and delivered radiation treatments, which reduces the amount of radiation delivered to the tumor and undesirably increases the radiation delivered to healthy or normal tissues. A need therefore exists for a method by which to provide a means for radiotherapy dosimetry whose results are volumetric, real-time, and independent of dose rate or energy. Researchers at the University of Michigan have invented a method and system for performing online adaptive radiotherapy using combined ultrasound and ionizing radiation induced acoustic imaging (iRAI) computed tomography imaging techniques. The device measures low to ultrahigh dose deliveries, and it allows for anatomical and functional imaging while measuring radiation doses given in real time to an area of interest during a radiotherapy session. This technology can therefore more easily track tumors and direct the delivery of radiation to the tumor site. The retrieved data can provide information which permits corrections to radiation dosage and locations between, or even during, radiotherapy treatments. The advantage of this approach is an improvement in the ratio of dosing delivered to the tumor versus the normal adjacent structures. This X-ray-induced acoustic computed tomography (XACT) model will be useful in the clinical setting for measuring absolute, relative, and in vivo dosimetry.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "A new method to track the cardiovascular thrombotic state in a highly sensitive manner. An assay that measures serum levels of 12-HETE, which predicts thrombotic risk. Could serve as a replacement for D-dimer in evaluating for active clotting. Platelets play an essential role in the vessel, maintaining hemostasis and normal blood flow following vascular insult or injury under physiological conditions. While activation of the platelet is essential for adhesion and aggregation to occur at the site of vascular injury, excessive platelet reactivity can lead to the formation of occlusive thrombi, the predominant underlying cause of myocardial infarction and stroke. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection of blood clotting remains an important part of the workup in these patients. D-dimer is a peptide released in the blood stream when plasmin splits fibrin that is present in a blood clot. So, D-dimer is commonly used as an initial screening test in emergency departments to diagnose patients who have symptoms consistent with myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or deep venous thrombosis. D-dimer testing may fail to increase in patients for various reasons including impaired fibrinolytic activity, anticoagulant use, or symptoms which have persisted for more than two weeks before testing. As such, a need exists for additional or improved methods to detect active clotting states in patients with life-threatening diagnoses who could benefit from timely initiation of anticoagulant therapy. A researcher at the University of Michigan has demonstrated that 12-HETE levels in the blood of patients with COVID-19 track the cardiovascular thrombotic state in a highly sensitive manner. The assay measures serum levels of 12-HETE, which is the product of 12-lipoxygenase oxidation of arachidonic acid in blood platelets. The investigator examined a longitudinal patient set with the infection and employed a prostaglandin and eicosanoid assay to reveal that 12-HETE may track even better than D-dimer for predicting thrombotic risk in these patients. While D-dimer testing is widely accepted as the first step in the work-up and management of patients with suspected, this novel test could serve as a replacement for D-dimer in diagnosing venous thromboembolism (VTE). This assay could therefore aid in the goal to exclude VTE and forego further expensive radiographic studies in outpatients with a low risk for harboring blood clots.",

Properties that permit efficacy in patients with TB and HIV coinfection. Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most significant world health problems, and a high proportion of these new cases and deaths occurs in HIV-positive people in Africa. Global population growth is increasing the disease burden, posing a continuing health and financial burden in various parts of the world, particularly Africa and Asia. TB is caused predominantly by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), an obligate aerobic bacillus that divides at an extremely slow rate. The chemical composition of MTB cell walls includes peptidoglycans and complex lipids, which are a significant determinant of its virulence. The unique structure of the cell wall of MTB allows it to lie dormant for many years as a latent infection, particularly as it can grow readily inside macrophages, hiding it from the host's immune system. The continuing rise in multidrug-resistant TB has further contributed to the dire need for new TB antibiotics as few new TB drugs have been introduced into clinical use in the last four decades. Furthermore, effective treatment of TB in persons co-infected with HIV is complicated due to drug\u201a\u00c4\u00ecdrug interactions. The rifamycins (RIFs) are the most commonly used drugs to treat MTB, and their mechanism involves inhibition of RNA polymerase (RNAP). However, these agents suffer from serious drawbacks including prolonged treatment times, enhanced drug metabolism due to cytochrome p450 induction (which can be particularly problematic for patients with HIV-MTB co-infection), and the existence of resistant mutations within RNAP that yield RIF-resistant (RIFR) MTB strains. A need therefore exists for novel and improved forms of TB therapy which can better manage the complexities of treating this disease. Researchers have synthesized and tested 69 benzoxazino-rifamycins (bxRif) that extend the rifamycin core to target a locus of the RNAP enzyme which has not previously been exploited as a target to treat MTB. The inventors have confirmed by X-ray crystal structural analysis that these BxRifs bind to the RNAP enzyme locus site as well as displaying that the compounds have bactericidal activity against both the replicating and latent states of MTB. Furthermore, the activity of the agents was shown to apply to both the wild-type and most prevalent mutant MTB RNA polymerases (RNAPs). The agents were also shown to be free of induction by the cytochrome p450 system, which has been shown to limit the activity and delay the effects of some classes of MTB drugs. The expectation of this novel approach to MTB treatment is that new RIF analogues will yield a candidate for early-stage development studies that provide a rifamycin analogue that allows for shorter treatment times, and which has enhanced activity against strains of TB currently resistant to rifamycin-derived drugs.",

    "ip_description": "EML2 is a microtubule-stabilizing factor that tracks shrinking microtubules. A novel screening method for readers of tyrosinated and detyrosinated tubulin. Allows for investigation of the full range of microtubule dynamics in mammalian cells. Microtubules are dynamic polymers assembled from the protein tubulin. During periods of normal cellular functioning, microtubules exhibit dynamic instability during which they grow and shorten to aid biological processes such as cell division, intracellular trafficking, and establishment of cell polarity. Tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs) alter microtubule properties by affecting the binding of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). The study of microtubule dynamics commonly includes the use of probes which aid the analysis of live cell microscopy. The probes employed to 'decorate' the growing ends of the microtubules are a heterogeneous class of proteins referred to as +TIPS. These end binding (EB) proteins are indispensable for microtubule research, though one drawback to their use is that they do not decorate microtubules when they are in the process of shortening. Therefore, a need exists for a probe that decorates both growing and shrinking microtubules to delineate microtubule dynamics and functioning in cells more fully. Researchers at the University of Michigan have discovered a protein (EML2) that tracks the ends of microtubules while they are in the process of shortening. The creation of this agent will be paired with EB to develop a 2-gene tool kit that decorates the ends of microtubules in all of their dynamic phases. As post-translational modifications through tyrosination and detyrosination of tubulin occur, EML2 localizes to shrinking microtubule plus ends to serve as 'readers' of these processes. The discovery shows that EML2 tracks the tips of shortening microtubules, a behavior not previously seen among human MAPs in vivo, and influences dynamics to increase microtubule stability. This single reagent will allow investigators to measure the full range of microtubule dynamics, in any mammalian cell type. The screening pipeline utilized to define EML2 can also be modified to discover readers of other tubulin post-translational modifications, such as acetylation or polyglycylation.",

A novel agent that shows advantageous properties compared to existing medicines. Thrombosis is a serious health problem underlying several cardiovascular pathologies, including stroke and myocardial infarction. Antiplatelet agents offer a desirable approach to thrombosis prevention through the reduction of platelet reactivity. Current antithrombotic therapies include anticoagulants, which limit blood clotting, antiplatelets, which inhibit platelet activation and aggregation, and thrombolytics, which work to dissolve the thrombus once formed. However, adverse effects associated with antithrombotic agents including high risk of hemorrhagic bleeding, slow absorption, poor bioavailability, short half-life, and narrow therapeutic windows have severely limited the agents' broad application in the clinic. Given that major bleeding events are one of the greatest concerns when utilizing antithrombotic agents, the development of safer and more effective strategies to prevent vascular occlusion is urgently needed. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a synthetic high-density lipoprotein (sHDL) nanoparticle which holds promise in acting as an effective antithrombotic vehicle for delivery while concurrently exerting a synergistic inhibitory effect on platelet hyperactivity. sHDL infusion has previously been shown to be an effective approach to inhibit platelet activation and arterial thrombosis in both mice and diabetic patients. This novel approach enables the delivery of higher levels of drug to sites of injury or inflammation while avoiding off-target accumulation, thus achieving improved antithrombotic efficacy through synergistic effects without compromising hemostasis. When compared to other types of nanoparticles, sHDL is advantageous because of its proven clinical safety as well as the ability to manufacture it through established large-scale manufacturing processes. Together, these factors demonstrate that the entrapment of an antithrombotic agent by sHDL provides an effective, feasible, and rapidly translatable strategy for the prevention of thrombotic events. In addition to its proven antithrombotic effect, sHDL is a biomimetic nanoparticle used to mimic the in vivo biological activity of endogenous HDL, which is well recognized as protective in cardiovascular and chronic inflammatory diseases. This invention may therefore prove effective for a wide variety of common, serious illnesses.",

Defines the role of host immune factors in the regulation of bacteria involved in colitis. Provides a strategy for the research and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is caused by genetic and environmental factors that alter intestinal homeostasis in susceptible individuals. The propensity to develop colitis is associated with abnormal changes in microbial populations of the gut in individuals with impaired immune systems. Microbes on the surface of intestinal cells express various conserved molecules, structures, and antigens that can be recognized by the host immune system for microbe killing and eradication. Many IBD-associated loci are known to regulate the recognition and killing of bacteria as well as the function of immune cells. The formation of IBD is commonly associated with an increased abundance of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), though the mechanism for this relationship remains unclear. A need exists to better understand the biologic role of AIEC in promoting IBD with the goal of producing novel treatments for colitis. Researchers have discovered that AIEC with mutations of genes that regulate surface polysaccharides can inhibit gut inflammation in a mouse model of colitis. Biochemical and functional studies show that mutation of the gene required for the production of certain surface polysaccharides rendered AIEC more sensitive to the immune system while retaining their ability to outcompete related bacteria in vitro. The specific AIEC mutation in Wzy, a gene that encodes the enzyme responsible for biosynthesis of the surface polysaccharide layer, permits the bacteria to colonize the intestine under while also protecting mice from colitis. The protective function of surface polysaccharide synthesized by Wzy is primarily observed under inflamed conditions, suggesting a role for host immune factors in the regulation of wzy-dependent bacterial fitness.

This unique anatomical location and structure make intravitreal injections an ideal targeted treatment for some eye conditions. One of the problems with intravitreal injections is that these medications might not penetrate fully the intraocular layers or tumors. Intraocular tumors like retinoblastoma are traditionally difficult to treat, though direct targeted injections of drugs and imaging agents into the eye may yield a novel approach for treatment of this disease. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are tubular structures composed of hexagonal arranged carbon atoms with nanometer diameters and high-capacity graphene cavities that can accommodate small molecules and fluorescent loading. Various mechanical, electrical, and optical properties of CNTs make them suitable for various therapeutic and diagnostic applications. CNTs are biocompatible and have reduced or lack of immunogenicity. Previous studies have shown the ability of CNTs to improve the efficacy of drugs like cisplatin and docetaxel as they target cancer cells throughout the body.

A device which provides real time feedback regarding feedback to the patient. At home robotic rehabilitation offers potential benefits for patients with neurological or orthopedic disorders. This approach may also prove useful for patients recovering after an injury or following surgery. However, since most assistive devices actively perform movements for the patient or force movement along a predefined path, incorrect programming could compromise the safety of the patient. Additionally, active robotic devices require several large motors, making the equipment bulky and expensive. Furthermore, if the patient has regained some functioning or has progressed sufficiently well through their therapy course, assistive therapy may prove suboptimal for this phase of recovery. While patients in this portion of their rehabilitation may rely on elastic bands or hand weights, the path of movement is not controllable with these forms of passive equipment. A need exists for a rehabilitation robot that provides a safer and more versatile user experience. Researchers at the University of Michigan have created a semi-passive robot (SepaRRo) which can provide safe, low-cost, in-home rehabilitation therapy for patients suffering from neurological or orthopedic disorders. The SepaRRo combines the benefits of assistive robots and traditional exercise equipment in a single, compact device.

SepaRRo\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s design enables a broad range of resistive forces which can therefore help to steer the movement of the limb along the desired path.

Lessens the number of required treatments and decreases complications. Skin pigmentation removal is useful for treatment of conditions such as nevi, vascular formations, or tumors. One common therapy for these conditions is laser treatment, which delivers high-energy pulses of light that heat one side of pigmented cells more rapidly than the other and causes them to burst, a process known as cavitation. The residual particles can subsequently be engulfed by phagocytes and processed by the immune system. However, laser treatment requires multiple sessions, may cause discomfort, and can lead to complications such as skin scarring, inflammation, or discoloration. One increasingly common scenario involves requests for tattoo removal by patients who come to regret their cosmetic decisions. In addition to the aforementioned limitations related to laser treatments, the removal of tattoos may require specific wavelengths dependent on the color of the ink in the tattoo, yielding greater difficulty in certain circumstances. So, a need exists for improvements in laser treatments for skin conditions and tattoo removal. Researchers have pioneered a means by which to use photoacoustic cavitation to improve skin pigmentation removal. The invention uses photo-mediated ultrasound to produce cavitation in pigmented cells. This approach therefore combines light and sound to decrease the amount of energy required for existing laser therapies, increasing the likelihood of cavitation while lessening the number of required treatments and decreasing the risk of complications. The higher percentage of pigment undergoing cavitation combined with a higher depth of photoacoustic penetration means that a single treatment session may be sufficient. In vivo data shows more than 50% removal of pigmentation within 28 days following a single treatment.

The samples can be analyzed by a variety of different diagnostic tests to diagnose disease and guide treatment plans. These types of biopsies have historically been reserved for the most severe vision-threatening cases due to the risk of dangerous side effects like retinal detachment. As such, a need exists for improved technologies to evaluate vitreous gel safely and effectively. Researchers at the University of Michigan have invented the Vitrector, an inexpensive, hand-held, disposable device designed to remove a 250 \u0152\u00baL sample of vitreous that can then be analyzed for diagnostic purposes. This device uses a small-gauge internal rotating needle with cutting action that is actuated through a magnet to extract a minimal fluid volume and requires no infusion component. These design features permit simplicity of use for the operator and provide a safer mechanism for liquid vitreous biopsy in the clinical setting. The main procedural mechanisms of the vitrector include a small-gauge (26 gauge) needle that cuts and 'liquifies' tissue and facilitates extraction of a minimal volume of liquid for diagnostic analysis. The device facilitates an improvement upon existing devices and could prove to be a very useful diagnostic tool for infection of the uvea or globe. Additionally, the device could provide a liquid biopsy that leads to personalized medical treatments. This approach can also provide better access to the retina for surgical repairs, remove scar tissue, or replace cloudy or hardened vitreous.",

    "ip_description": "A mandibular advancement device that evaluates and improves sleep apnea symptoms. It dynamically senses and responds to obstructive sleep apnea symptoms and can remove or replace laboratory sleep studies required for MADs or CPAP. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when the muscles in the throat relax too much during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep causing the back of the tongue to occlude the airway and interrupt sleep. This condition affects approximately 25 million people in the United States, and OSA patients can come to be at a heightened risk for multiple health issues such as elevated blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and arrhythmias. Existing interventions may help to limit the effects of OSA, though each of these treatments may be poorly suited for individual patients. For example, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines are a common intervention for those with OSA, yet this approach is limited by loud operation, a propensity for causing dehydration, and other uncomfortable physical feelings that can lead to poor patient compliance. Mandibular advancement devices (MADs) are a popular alternative to CPAPs which work by moving the mandible forward to help prevent airway occlusion. Unfortunately, the technology used in existing MADs holds the jaw in a static advanced position which causes jaw muscle soreness and undermines the goal for improving sleep quality. A need exists to improve the comfort and patient compliance of MADs interventions. University of Michigan researchers have developed a mandibular advancement device that dynamically senses and responds to obstructive sleep apnea symptoms while patients sleep. This technology is a robotic MAD that can detect OSA, dynamically advance the jaw to treat OSA symptoms, and relax the jaw when symptoms subside. The machine employs an actuator that uses a small brushed DC motor to drive a threaded rod, ultimately advancing the lower jaw. The prototype consists of two retainer trays on which the components of the actuator are mounted. Two motor gearboxes are mounted on the upper tray, one on either side of the jaw. Each motor gearbox contains a motor and gear that turns a threaded rod. The rod threads into and pulls forward a plastic post, called the upper block. The upper block then contacts a protruding lower block, which is part of the lower retainer tray. When the actuator is powered, the upper block pushes on the lower block, forcing the lower jaw to protrude forward. This invention is therefore designed to reduce the discomfort of traditional MADs and improve or replace the expensive lab sleep studies patients must go through to calibrate both traditional MADs and CPAP machines. As such, this device represents a significant improvement over conventional medical devices for the evaluation of and treatment for OSA.",

    "ip_description": "3D-printed ankle foot orthosis (APO) with a pre-bent steel strut and tunable stiffness. Minimizes AFO-shoe interference by diminishing the need for thick reinforcement of the foot. Permits variable rehabilitation options by adding or subtracting steel plates to the base strut. An ankle foot orthosis (AFO) is a device that encompasses the leg and foot to improve walking patterns caused by any of variety of physical illnesses. The general types of conditions which may lead a patient to require an APO include pain, limited range of motion, muscle weakness or paralysis, neurological deficits such as those caused by cerebrovascular accident, sensory deficit, or asymmetric leg length. An APO is worn with socks and shoes and can reduce, prevent, or limit maladaptive movement of the lower leg and foot by supporting weak muscles. APO devices are categorized as being flexible, rigid, or jointed, and they may be custom made or available 'off the shelf'. The positioning goals for an APO include one which causes the least amount of pain while maintaining the most functional position. The prescription of an APO for an individual patient can be complicated by an imperfect fit with the leg and foot, awkward placement of the device with the patient's shoe, and variable or changing needs for device stiffness as a patient moves through their rehabilitation. Researchers at the University of Michigan have invented a new 3-part ankle foot orthosis that employs a pre-bent stainless-steel strut with a low profile as well as the ability to tailor stiffness of the device by adding or removing plates as a patient progresses through their rehabilitation. This device is made of three parts which include the foot, calf, and strut. The foot and calf portions that contact the patient are 3D-printed using a plastic called Nylon 12 which is known to exhibit tensile strength and remain flexible without fracturing. The strut that connects the foot and calf are made from the AISI 1075 spring steel, which has a higher carbon content and is therefore softer and more easily molded than some other steels. The researchers' first innovation is to pre-bend the steel strut to the shape of the ankle area of the foot, enabling adoption to the 3D-printed foot without the need for a thick reinforcement region that could interfere with the patient's shoe. Their second innovation provides the option to add additional steel plates to adjust the stiffness to match an individual patient's needs. Additional steel plates can therefore be added to this original base strut to increase the AFO stiffness as the patient progresses through their rehabilitation. All the device components are easily manufactured and customizable to the individual patient.",

    "ip_description": "An anti-cancer agent that is non-toxic and overcomes therapeutic drug resistance. GRP78 inhibition disrupts endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and induces apoptosis. A new class of agents that affects ER functioning in immune and cancer cells. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a multifunctional cellular organelle responsible for the proper folding of newly synthesized proteins, degradation of misfolded proteins, and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Cells which are subject to intrinsic stress activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to mitigate the consequences of ER stress and to maintain cellular homeostasis. UPR can either mitigate the deleterious effects of ER stress or then can activate programmed cell death, or apoptosis. Glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) is a key molecular chaperone in the ER and also serves as a master regulator of ER stress signaling. Cancer cells are highly proliferative and have a greater demand for protein synthesis and folding. Additionally, cancer cells are subject to extrinsic stress in the cancer microenvironment including hypoxia, low pH, and nutrient deprivation. Such conditions contribute to ER stress and impaired ER functions, altering GRP78 functioning. GRP78 regulates UPR by activating ER transmembrane sensors and play important roles in regulating various cellular process required for tumor survival and growth. Thus, redirecting the UPR response to apoptosis in cancer cells is a promising approach for cancer therapy. A need exists to selectively influence the UPR response to promote apoptosis in cancer cells. Researchers at the University of Michigan have identified GRP78 inhibitors that function as effective therapeutic agents for treating cancer. The inhibition of GRP78 disrupts ER homeostasis and suppresses its anti-apoptotic properties, providing an avenue to overcome resistance to multiple anti-cancer agents. One GRP78 inhibitor, YUM 70, demonstrates synergy with the FDA approved drugs topotecan and vorinostat in killing pancreatic cancer cells. YUM70 showed significant anticancer activity in an in vivo pancreatic cancer xenograft model with no observed toxicity to normal tissues. The researchers have gone on to synthesize a large number of YUM70 analogues containing novel features including better solubility, physicochemical, and pharmaceutical properties. Beyond production of these inhibitors, this invention therefore dovetails with the creation of a new class of proteolysis targeting chimeric (PROTAC) agents and GRP78 degraders within cells of the immune system and other cancers.",

    "ip_description": "A novel class of 2-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives that modulate sirtuin5 (SIRT5). Permits selective degradation of SIRT5 proteins in the mitochondrial matrix. Provides a means to inhibit SIRT5 with the goal of causing tumor cell death. Sirtuins are a family of signaling proteins involved in metabolic regulation whose physical structure is consistent across many life forms. These proteins influence cellular processes such as transcription, apoptosis, inflammation, stress resistance, and aging. There are seven sirtuin members encoded in mammalian genomes, designated SIRT1 through SIRT 7. SIRT 5 resides predominately in the mitochondrial matrix and is specifically known to influence pathways related to ammonia detoxification, fatty acid oxidation, cellular respiration, ketone body formation, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), glycolysis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Dysregulated or uncontrolled SIRT 5 activity is associated with diseases including cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. So, a need exists to better understand the biology of SIRT5 and to modulate its behavior to treat diseases associated with its dysfunction. Researchers at the University of Michigan have discovered a series of 2-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors and degraders of SIRT5. The scientists have found that SIRT5 depletion induces rapid cell death in specific cancer types such as melanoma, Ewing sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and neuroblastoma. The researchers screened an in-house library of compounds using a thermal shift assay to identify this novel class of 2-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, and they developed proteolysis targeting chimeric (PROTAC) molecules that selectively induce the degradation of SIRT5 proteins in the mitochondrial matrix. The wide range of substrates for SIRT5 suggest that successful modulation of its function may influence various disease types. These inhibitors and degraders may be useful in the treatment of all the disorders associated with SIRT5 dysfunction.",

    "ip_description": "A novel therapeutic strategy to circumvent proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Modulation of pyruvate kinase M2 to regulate transcription of proglycolytic genes. Can both prevent PVR and improve photoreceptor survival. Retinal detachment (RD) is an important cause of visual loss, and its treatment commonly includes an attempt at surgical reattachment. About 10% of these surgeries fail due to proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), characterized by a brisk vitreous retraction followed by significant periretinal proliferation. The incidence of PVR correlates with fibrotic membrane production on both surfaces of the retina and portends poor visual outcomes. PVR management currently relies on surgical removal of these membranes, though the resection can incite additional fibrosis and recurrent PVR. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is central to PVR pathogenesis, and metabolic reprogramming that increases local tissue glycolysis is a well understood hallmark of RPE EMT. Still, there are currently no available pharmacologic therapies to address PVR, so a need exists for additional research to provide novel treatment methods. University of Michigan researchers have discovered that modulation of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) can alter the metabolic profile of retinal pigment epithelial cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition to successfully inhibit EMT induced RPE cell proliferation and contraction. PKM2 is a known regulator of glycolysis that exists in dimer or tetramer forms, the latter of which may translocate to cell nuclei and regulate transcription of proglycolytic genes. These researchers have previously shown PKM2 modulation to be a promising strategy for photoreceptor neuroprotection following retinal detachment. The current report is the first to elucidate the importance of PKM2 in RPE EMT and PVR, the effects of which are non-toxic to highly differentiated RPE. Thus, pharmacologic modulation of PKM2 has the potential to both prevent the formation of PVR and improve photoreceptor survival, thereby addressing two major causes of irreversible vision loss after RD.",

BanLec-CART results from a banana-derived lectin that tightly binds mannose residues. Proven effective against chemorefractory lung cancer cell lines. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is an immuno-oncology strategy that involves the harvesting and engineering of a patient's own immune cells to selectively combat their cancer cells when re-introduced to the patient. CAR-T cells are engineered to recognize specific antigens that are selectively expressed on malignant cells in order to target them for destruction. While there has been great success in adoptive therapy with engineered T cells for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, one limitation to development of this therapy for solid tumors is the lack of specific target antigens on tumor tissue. Though there are many different antigens available for targeting in various cancers, especially in difficult to treat solid tumors, where cell surface marker expression is highly heterogeneous. The vast majority of all other CAR-T cell therapies have been engineered with an extracellular domain derived from an antibody. A need exists to further discover new cell surface targets on solid tumors for develop additional CAR-T therapies. Researchers at the University of Michigan have engineered a T cell that selectively targets malignant cells decorated with altered sugar residues for treatment with CAR-T cell therapy. The invention takes advantage of the propensity for malignant cells to exhibit altered glycobiology, such that their extracellular sugar landscape differentiates them from normal tissue. Researchers identified a lectin that binds high mannose residues within which the mutation of a single amino acid moiety has made this molecule extraordinarily specific such that it does not promote the non-specific mitogenicity common to other lectins. The name of the discovery, BanLec-CART, alludes to its construction from a banana-derived lectin that binds mannose residues. The scientists have demonstrated antigen specific activity of BanLec-CAR T cells against chemorefractory lung cancer cell lines. The likelihood exists that other types of solid tumors or hematologic malignancies will respond to this new form of treatment, as well.",

    "ip_description": "A novel approach to addressing the pathologic effects of adrenocortical carcinoma. Decreases cholesterol levels, inhibits cortisol secretion, and lowers mitochondrial activity. Concurrent administration of two or all three of these drug classes is effective. The adrenal gland produces hormones that affect development, handling stress, growth, and the regulation of kidney function. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) can arise from the cortex of the adrenal gland, though it is often difficult to diagnose by either radiographic or pathologic evaluation when compared to more commonly occurring and benign adrenal adenomas. ACC causes severe issues related to excess steroid production that suppresses immune responses and disrupts multiple physiological functions. Symptoms may include weight gain, muscle weakness, insomnia, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Therefore, a great need exists for agents which can address the physiologic effects of ACC and treat the underlying cancer. Researchers at the University of Michigan describe improved control of ACC symptoms through the use of two or more of the following three classes of drugs: 1) an agent capable of inhibiting cholesterol efflux, 2) an agent capable of inhibiting cortisol secretion, and 3) an agent capable of inhibiting mitochondrial activity. The medicine which addresses increases in cholesterol levels does so by inhibiting cholesterol cell membrane transporters named ABCA1 and ABCG1. The treatment that decreases cortisol secretion inhibits the multi drug resistant gene (MDR1) related cortisol secretion and MDR1 P-glycoprotein multiple drug transporter activity. The agent that decreases mitochondrial activity or ATP synthesis does so by inhibiting mitochondrial electric chain activity related to cholesterol accumulation.

Permits future research and treatment of cellular disorders and treatments. The maintenance of cellular homeostasis is tightly regulated by the balance of protein synthesis and degradation. Cullin RING ligases (CRLS) are responsible for maintenance of about 20% of intracellular proteins, and CRLS dysregulation has been implicated in a variety of diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and viral infections. Inappropriately decreased CRLs functioning can lead to overaccumulation of those proteins that are intended for destruction by pathway. Normal activation of the intracellular proteins responsible for the timely destruction of proteins relies on a cascade of enzyme reactions which are controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) via tagging the ubiquitin on targeted proteins. One important interaction required for the successful progression of this cascade involves the binding of enzymes DCN1 and UBC12. The potential benefits of modulating this interaction have led to a need for agents which can influence the UBC12-DCN1 binding site. Researchers at the University of Michigan have discovered a small molecule inhibitor of the UBC12-DCN1 interaction named DI-591. The effects of this inhibition can help treat diseases caused by dysregulation of the cellular forces that provide protein homeostasis. The DI-591 discovery is highly potent and cell-permeable small molecule inhibitor that selectively binds to DCN1 while leaving other enzymes along the ubiquitin-proteasome system pathway unaffected. Previous attempts to define small molecule molecules in the UPS pathway have been limited by the relatively large and flat physical shapes of the protein interfaces. While most of the existing inhibitors have relied on chemically reactive groups for successful binding, DI-591 physically complexes with a well-defined binding groove in DCN1. This selectivity stands out favorably when compared to existing agents that modify this pathway for protein breakdown.

DCN1 maintains a shape that provides a well-defined pocket for use as a binding surface for interactions between protein-regulating enzymes.

May serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and prostate cancer treatment. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men and causes about 25,000 deaths in the United States each year. The prostate develops and maintains normal function through the interaction of androgens, predominately testosterone, and androgen receptors (AR) found on normal prostate cells. Not only are androgens levels positively correlated with the formation of prostate cancer in men, but AR expression also continues during the transformation of cells into prostate cancer. In addition to anatomically localized prostate cancer treatments such as surgery or radiotherapy, one avenue for treatment of locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer has been the inhibition of androgens to decrease AR activation. However, a number of prostate cancers transition their behavior to become hormone resistant. For men with cancers having this status, AR may still be expressed and in some cases may have mutated to recognize ligands outside of androgens. A need therefore exists to develop therapies that target AR rather than influencing the androgens, themselves. Researchers at the University of Michigan have discovered a novel androgen receptor (AR) induced long, non-coding RNA (IncRNA) named ARInc1 which is specifically associated with the prostate and prostate cancer. ARInc1 is induced by AR and has been found to participate in a feedback loop that enhances the signaling of AR. The expression of ARInc1 is not noted in normal tissues other than the prostate, and its tumor expression is limited to those that originate in the prostate. ARInc1 therefore may act as a biomarker for prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Investigations in a mouse model showed that reducing the gene expression of ARInc1 led to suppression of AR as well as a decrease in prostate cancer tumor growth. This novel lncRNA therefore has the potential to serve has a therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate cancer by controlling the expression of AR. Given that ARInc1 acts upstream of AR, it may be used in cancers which have become resistant to AR-targeted treatment.",

Can increase the effects of immune check point therapy without increasing side effects. The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) transmembrane protein found in endoplasmic reticulum senses cytosolic double-stranded DNA and cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs). Activation of STING has shown potential to enhance antitumor immunity through the induction of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Conversely, activation of the STING pathway has been shown to stimulate tumor growth through the increased production of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO), an enzyme that under normal conditions modulates innate immune responses during infection but which has been seen to activate in tumor cells as well as adjacent stratal cells in neoplasia. The expression of IDO by endothelial cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, mesenchymal cells, and peripheral blood in settings of tumor growth suggests that IDO inhibition can play a part in cancer therapy. Given that previous studies have revealed limitations when separately stimulating the STING pathway or inhibiting the IDO pathway, a need exists for a means by which to concurrently influence both the STING and IDO pathways for research and treatment of human cancers. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a dual function lipidated chemical element comprising both STING agonist and IDO inhibitor functionality, including use of STING agonist dimers and long chain lipids and 'special' lipids, as a potential pathway for cancer treatment. The basis for the combined effects of these two actions rests on the knowledge that STING agonists can activate IDO and promote the growth of tumors. The inhibition of IDO may therefore increase the effects of immune checkpoint therapy without significantly increasing side effects associated with their use.

These illnesses are hereditary metabolic disorders in which excessive amounts of lipid cause dysfunction following collection in organs such as the brain, peripheral nervous system, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Enzyme deficiencies in distinct sites of cellular lipid metabolism can cause maladies including Gaucher's disease, Niemann-Pick disease, Tay-Sachs disease, Fabry's disease, Farber's disease, Sandhoff disease, Krabbe disease, Metachromatic leukodystrophy, Wolman's disease, and cholesteryl ester storage disease. Glycosphingolipids reside in the cell membrane and are involved in cell adhesion as well as cell-to-cell interactions. Dysregulation of glycosphingolipids not only causes lipid storage diseases, but it can also lead to renal dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The first committed biosynthetic step in the production of glycosphingolipids relies on an enzyme named glucosylceramide synthase (GCS). GCS inhibition serves as a mechanism to treat certain lipid storage diseases, and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is available to help address the manifestations of Fabry disease and Gaucher's disease. However, clinical outcomes following the use of these medicines are imperfect, and a need exists for novel and improved methods to treat metabolic abnormalities related to glycosphingolipids.

The new agents can investigate the biological effects of glucosylceramide synthase inhibition using in vitro and in vivo models. These GCS inhibitors may also hold promise to treat renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.",

    "ip_description": "Novel class of glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors. Best in class efficacy in treating lipid storage diseases. Replacement for more invasive therapeutic options. Lipids are important parts of the membranes found within and between each cell as well as in the myelin sheath that coats and protects nerves. Lipid storage diseases are rare metabolic disorders that cause a dangerous build-up of lipids within cells and tissues throughout the body. This lipid build up can cause permanent cellular damage, particularly in the nervous system, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Several diagnoses fall into the category of lipid storage diseases, including Gaucher, Fabry, Sandhoff, and Tay-Sachs diseases. These disorders have historically been treated with enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs). ERTs are administered by delivering recombinant proteins (glucocerebrosidase) through intravenous injections to aid in the breakdown of lipids. Even given their successes, ERTs are not suitable for all patients, and their beneficial effects can vary between affected organs and can also be difficult to assess in any given patient. Furthermore, this class of medicines is not free of side effect risks and requires lifelong intravenous administrations that can be expensive. Therefore, a need exists for new options to treat illnesses which make up this disease class. Researchers have discovered novel pyrimidine-based inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase that can be used to treat both neuronopathic and peripheral lipid storage diseases, including Gaucher, Sandhoff, Tay-Sachs and Fabry. This substrate reduction therapy (SRT) represents a new class of glucosylceramide synthetase inhibitors that provide chemically distinct and diverse scaffolds that are capable of treating these lipid storage diseases. SRTs are orally administered and therefore do not require the inconvenience or risks associated with intravenous administration. The inhibition of glucosylceramide synthetase permits a broad range of potentially therapeutic effects, including decreases in glucosylceramide in Gaucher as well as overproduction of glycosphingolipids in Tay-Sachs, Sandhoff, and Fabry.",

    "ip_description": "Infusion of a synthetic high density lipoprotein increased survival from sepsis. Treatment helped to control inflammation and platelet aggregation in vitro and in vivo. Improved sepsis survival from 30% to 90% in a mouse model. The goal of the normal host response to infection is to localize and control bacterial invasion. Sepsis results when that response to infection becomes generalized and creates processes that negatively impact healthy tissues, resulting in severe morbidity or even death. While the early signs and symptoms of sepsis may include fevers, confusion, shortness of breath, or increased heart rate, the condition may progress to include loss of consciousness or multi-system organ failure. The current approach to patients with sepsis is supportive care including antibiotics and attempts to prop up heart and lung function as needed, though no definitive treatment for sepsis has been developed. For some time, researchers have observed significant decreases in high density lipoproteins (HDLs) during sepsis but have been unable to translate these results into a therapy. The decreased HDL levels appear to be related solely to the circumstance of sepsis rather than occurring in any other trauma patients. A need exists for a means by which to exploit this response to develop therapies that help address sepsis. Researchers have discovered that the infusion of a synthetic HDL (sHDL) in a mouse model of sepsis improved survival. The infusions were noted to control inflammation and platelet aggregation in vitro and in vivo, minimizing the effects normally associated with the septic state. The investigators were able to identify the most effective sHDL, named 22A-DMPC, among a range of options. This agent significantly reduced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, as was confirmed by that absence of inflammatory infiltrates in biopsies of the liver and lung. Mice that were treated with 22A-DMPC had improvements in their survival from 30% to 90%. Given the high prevalence of sepsis coupled with the lack of an FDA-approved therapeutic, the current technology would be of significant interest to companies developing sepsis or inflammatory therapeutics. Previous clinical attempts employing sHDLs to treat atherosclerosis further underlie the market demand for this product and potentially, a second market that would benefit from this technology.",

    "ip_description": "A nanobody that can address brain pathology associated with Lewy body dementia. Prevents the aggregation of alpha-synuclein, the protein associated with LBD. Single dose therapy that crosses the blood-brain barrier directly into affected cells. Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common type of dementia, and it is characterized by the deposition of protein deposits in the brain called Lewy bodies that cause progressive deficits in thinking, memory, and movement. Lewy bodies are also associated with Parkinson\u2019s Disease, and patients with LBD commonly exhibit symptoms of parkinsonism. The illness is also seen to cause neurofibrillary plaques and tangles that are common in patients with Alzheimer's dementia. LBD is chronic, debilitating, progressive, and associated with a life expectancy of 7 to 8 years following diagnosis, though progression to a fatal disease may occur much more rapidly in some of those who are afflicted with this disease. No effective treatment currently exists. Emerging postmortem and experimental studies suggest that pathogenic alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is a prion-like protein driving the pathogenesis of Lewy bodies dementia (LBD). A single administration of recombinant alpha-syn preformed fibrils (PFF) in animal models can lead to substantial alpha-syn pathology spreading to the cortex, resulting in cognitive impairment. Toxic protein aggregates in the brain have been difficult to treat because antibody therapeutics cannot be efficiently delivered across the blood-brain barrier. However, antibody fragments called nanobodies offer promise thanks to their smaller size and ability to reach affected areas of the brain and parts of the toxic aggregates inaccessible to larger antibodies. Researchers have designed nanobody libraries and selected those which will preferentially bind to alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils that cause Lewy body dementia. The nanobodies are formed in a manner that excludes disulfide bonds and are therefore capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and targeting toxic aggregates inside of the cell, where they are most detrimental, rather than outside of it. This novel therapeutic agent prevents the in vitro and in vivo aggregation of alpha-syn in the cortex of the brain where cognitive defects are created. And because the nanobody is packaged and delivered to cells in a viral vector, dementia patients may only require a single dose rather than needing to remember daily oral medications or traveling to clinics for frequent antibody infusions. More broadly, the researchers developed a library of modified nanobodies that could be interrogated against other intracellular targets that traditional antibodies have failed to address.",

    "ip_description": "A small molecule that decreased bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease. Affects the reaction between the Shared Epitope and calreticulin in stimulating osteoclasts. Oral delivery in a mouse model decreased arthritis by 50%. Inflammation and bone erosion are common complications of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and periodontal disease, and they are associated with increased severity of these illnesses. Currently available rheumatoid arthritis treatments only target the end stages of the immunological responses that cause deleterious manifestations of the disease. And, given that these agents are fairly non-specific in their actions, their use can result in significant side effects. The protein HLA-DRB1 is associated with the Major Histocompatibility Complex and may contain a specific genetic marker that associates with a greater incidence and severity of RA. This 'Shared Epitope' (SE) is present in up to 80% of patients with RA and interacts with Calreticulin (CRT) to drive inappropriate bone erosion. A need exists to discover a means to disrupt the SE/CRT interaction to mitigate bone loss in RA patients and minimize the effects of the disease. Researchers have discovered a small molecule called HL840 which inhibits the SE/CRT interaction to inhibit disease development, decrease arthritis severity, and prevent bone destruction in mouse models. HL840 can be easily formed and isolated, and the resulting drug can be safely administered orally on a twice-per-week schedule. The medicine suppresses nitric oxide-mediated signaling pathways, ultimately leading to decreased differentiation and activation of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for the break down and reabsorption of bone tissue. This new technology elicits its activity by targeting a specific pathway important for early rheumatoid arthritis pathophysiology. Experiments in arthritic mouse models demonstrate that the technology reduces the incidence of arthritis by greater than 50% and diminishes the severity of the disease in afflicted organisms. Notably, these results are heavily correlated with significant reductions in the degree of bone erosion. Owing to its specificity, the risk of side effects associated with its use are significantly lower than those related to existing medications. As such, the discovery may serve as a useful lead molecule for developing novel therapies for rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease.",

    "ip_description": "A novel type of photoreceptor which readily absorbs UVA and UVB rays. LITE-1 is an ideal organic additive to sunscreens to absorb UV rays. Can serve as a therapeutic tool to determine light sensitivity of cells and tissues. Ultraviolet radiation comes naturally from the sun or alternatively from man-made sources such as tanning beds or welding torches. The ultraviolet radiation produced by the sun can be separated into ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) groupings. While both UVA and UVB radiation can cause a number of damaging effects to the skin and have been associated with carcinomas and malignant melanomas, UVB rays are more associated with the deleterious effects of sun exposure over a lifetime. Over the past several decades, increased knowledge about the effects of UV exposure have led to guidance on behaviors to minimize the effects of sun exposure. In addition to recommendations to stay in the shade, to avoid the sun in the heat of the day, and to wear protective clothing to minimize areas of skin exposure, the regular use of sunscreen has been advocated by healthcare professionals. While the use of sunscreen is helpful in decreasing the effects of sunlight on skin, it has unfortunately only shown a 25% decrease of skin related tumors and diseases from the protection of harmful UVA and UVB rays. A need exists to discover additional agents that provide skin protection from the sun. Researchers have discovered that the nematode protein LITE-1 is a novel type of photoreceptor which readily absorbs wavelengths in the UVA and UVB spectrum and can resist photo bleaching from UVB wavelengths. LITE-1 can be distinguished from known photoreceptors by an exceptionally high efficiency in photo absorption, making it an ideal organic additive to sunscreens for skin protection against harmful UV rays present in sunlight. Recombinant LITE-1 can easily be purified through affinity chromatography, providing sufficient concentrations with which to work. The addition of substances such as tryptophan residues augment LITE-1 function and can be introduced into other proteins to confer photosensitivity, thereby suggesting a potential route for genetically engineering novel photoreceptors through this approach. Namely, upon expression of LITE-1 or its derivatives, other cells or tissues can become sensitive to light. Thus, LITE-1 and its derivatives may be used as a novel therapeutic tool, which can be turned on or off with light, to intervene in the function of cells, tissues and organs of patients and healthy individuals. The photosensitive properties of LITE-1 also create an opportunity for its use beyond medicine in the fields of materials science and engineering.",

Researchers have also calculated that microparticle-loaded chemotherapy given concurrently with agents known to relax the Sphincter of Oddi improve diffusion and accumulation of the anti-neoplastic drugs through the pancreas. This technology may additionally be useful for treating benign diseases associated with the pancreas, including pancreatitis and diabetes.

    "ip_description": "A novel indwelling urinary catheter that recognizes indole produced by E. coli. Incorporation of an agent that shows clinically relevant E. coli concentrations. Permits visual confirmation of urinary tract infections with red coloring. Indwelling urinary catheters are medical implants commonly used in hospitals, nursing facilities, and homes to relieve urinary retention and incontinence. This device can be implanted for short-term use (< 4 weeks) or long-term use (1-3 months). One of the primary risks with indwelling catheters is the risk of infection, specifically catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). Symptoms of CAUTI can range from mild (urethritis, fever, and cystitis) to severe (renal scarring, acute pyelonephritis, calculus formation, and bacteremia). Without timely treatment, infections can lead to urosepsis and death. CAUTI infections are most often caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli). Various methods have been developed for E. coli detection, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), mass spectrometry, conventional culture methods, aptamer-based sensors, and immunoassays. However, these methods present considerable limitations such as multi-step incubation and preparation, complicated instruments to be operated by trained professionals, and in many cases, samples that must be sent away for testing. Inevitably, these approaches lead to a longer wait time to retrieve results and initiate treatment. Researchers report the development of a urinary catheter-based colorimetric sensor for on-body detection of Escherichia coli (E. coli), the most prevalent bacterial species in urinary tract infections associated with the use of urinary catheters. This novel indwelling catheter sensor recognizes indole, a characteristic metabolite produced by E. coli. While existing techniques utilize this approach in vitro to identify indole as a surrogate for the presence of E. coli, the current technology incorporates a nitrosating agent into a silicone catheter to provide a clinically relevant red color change to signify indole production, and therefore E. coli activity. This color change allows for early diagnosis of urinary tract infections using the naked eye by functionalizing an exposed section of urinary catheters with the molecular probe. This silicone-based colorimetric sensor clearly differentiates E. coli below and above 105 colony forming unites per milliliter, which is the threshold concentration of bacteriuria. The technology therefore has important implications for usefulness in clinical situations, and beyond.",

    "ip_description": "A novel JAK inhibitor that successfully treats ulcerative colitis with minimal systemic absorption and therefore low risk of side effects. It has superior efficacy to existing agents that treat ulcerative colitis. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) affects about one million people in the United States. The major types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease, with the incidence of the former twice that of the latter. UC usually originates the rectum and extends proximally to the colon. The associated inflammation is restricted to the innermost, or mucosal, layer of the intestine and results in ulceration and bloody diarrhea. In addition, UC patients have up to 18% higher risk of developing colon cancer, depending on the severity and the duration of the disease. UC occurs widely in all age groups and large portion of patients relapse, thereby requiring life-long treatment. Several treatment options exist for patients with UC, including anti-inflammatory medicines such as corticosteroids or 5-aminosalicylates, which unfortunately both suffer from both spotty usefulness and treatment-related toxicities. Generalized immune system suppressors like azathioprine and cyclosporin also have limited efficacy and create risks for systemic side effects. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies can work quite well, though they require lifelong injections. More recently, inhibition of the Janus Kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2) has emerged as a new and better therapeutic approach for the treatment of UC12. However, JAK inhibitors are associated with side effects including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, malignancies, and infections. A need exists for a method to deliver JAK inhibitors in a way that is more anatomically specific to the GI tract. Researchers have discovered a GI locally activating JAK inhibitor for the treatment of colitis while minimizing systemic drug exposure to reduce the potential side effects. The compound MMT3-72 showed minimal inhibitory activities against all JAKs while also exhibiting minimal absorption into the systemic circulation. Subsequently, the local activation of MMT3-72 released the active form MMT3-72-M2 which does elicit potent JAK inhibitory activities in GI tissues. The drug was noted to be present in particularly high concentrations in the colon. And experiments in mouse models showed the agent to have superior efficacy compared to the existing drug tofacitinib as measured by disease activity incidence (DAI) scoring, length of affected colon, GI bleeding, and histologic examination of recovered colonic tissues. These data suggest that GI locally activating JAK inhibitor MMT3-72 provides advantage for superior efficacy and minimizes potential systemic side effects in treatment of IBD.",

    "ip_description": "The wingless-related integration site (Wnt) and its central component beta-catenin form an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that plays an important role in cellular homeostasis. Wnt/Beta-catenin regulates embryo development, cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammation-associated cancer. It is highly activated in about 20% of human neoplasms and promotes proliferation of cancer stem cell subsets in tumors. Wnt signaling is associated with tumor resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and to the influences of immune-mediated effects. Wnt signaling has been targeted as a method for anti-cancer therapy, though the resulting changes in non-cancer cell homeostasis have caused toxicity that has limited this approach. Therefore, a need exists to develop successful anti-tumor targets through Wnt signaling using a tissue-specific approach to limit adverse effects. Researchers at the University of Michigan have identified a novel, tissue-specific axis of the Wnt/beta-catenin programming that creates signaling in oncogenic tissues while not impacting healthy tissues. Through comprehensive molecular profiling studies, this technology identified targets of Wnt signaling that rely on a physical interaction between beta-catenin tissue-specific transcription factors. In cells, beta catenin is recruited to active enhancers in a tissue-specific, transcription-factor dependent manner. Perturbation of this interaction through any one of multiple pharmacological approaches can cause loss of tissue-specific transcriptional programming, reduced viability, and diminished sustained proliferation potential in vitro. These data suggest that the ultimate consequence of Wnt pathway alterations in Wnt-drive cancers is co-optation and mis-engagement tissue-specific transcription factors to reinforce pro-proliferative oncogenic programming. Therefore, this novel approach described by the inventors provides a strategy that increases the therapeutic index and likelihood of success targeting this pathway in future clinical trials.",

    "ip_description": "Intranasal immunotherapy that provides food allergy protection. Suppresses T helper cell 2 and immunoglobulin E allergic responses. Can be formulated with multiple allergens to provide allergy protection. Food allergy is an emerging epidemic that now affects up to 15 million people in the US, including 8% of children. Thirty to forty percent of patients with food allergies are sensitized to multiple foods. While allergen-specific immunotherapy has the potential to relieve the burden of fear of reactivity to specific foods, this approach is more difficult for polysensitized individuals. Allergen-specific immunotherapy for food allergy involves the progressive administration of increasing amounts of a specific allergen by one of several routes and has been the primary approach to suppress allergic reactivity. While some studies have demonstrated the ability to desensitize patients with oral immunotherapy (OIT) for up to 5 foods simultaneously (multi-OIT), the amount of each food required to be consumed daily is a burden for some children. Also, this approach does not provide long-term protection following cessation of therapy. Given these realities, there is interest in the development of therapies for food allergy that work more broadly and are not specific to one allergen. Subcutaneous immunotherapy to food allergens showed promise for protection against IgE-mediated food allergies, however significant adverse reactions limited successful implementation. The primary immunologic mechanism of allergic hypersensitivity is the induction of T helper 2 cell (Th2) polarized cellular immune responses leading to the production of allergen specific IgE antibodies critical for mast cell activation. While OIT has been proven clinically useful for treating food allergy, it has not induced a long-term redirection of allergen-specific immunity away from a Th2 phenotype. A need exists to develop new strategies that are able to permanently suppress Th2 cellular immune responses or redirect these cellular Th2 responses towards a Th1 phenotype. University of Michigan researchers have discovered that intranasal immunotherapy with allergens formulated in a nanoemulsion (NE) mucosal adjuvant that suppresses Th2/IgE-mediated allergic responses and protects from allergen challenge in murine food allergy models. Protection from oral allergen challenge was achieved despite the persistence of allergen-specific IgE and was associated with strong suppression of both Th2-polarized immune responses, alarmins and type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2). Their discovery demonstrates that anaphylactic reactions to food allergens can be suppressed using allergen-specific immunotherapy without having to eliminate allergen-specific IgE. The inventors discovered that NE can be formulated with multiple allergens and can lead to allergic suppression of all allergens included in the vaccine. Given that long-term protection can be achieved with only a few doses administered at monthly intervals, this approach would significantly reduce the burden on patients with multiple food allergies over daily, allergen-specific immunotherapies.",

    "ip_description": "Novel method for generating neural tube-like structures that mimic in vivo conditions. Orthogonal gradients create anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral neural tube patterning. Creates a model to study neural tube development and disorders. The neural tube is the embryonic progenitor of the central nervous system, with the posterior region giving rise to the spinal cord and the anterior region developing into the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. An important process which takes place during the development of the neural tube is the cell fate specification and patterning along the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes, which leads to the differentiation of classes of neuronal progenitor cells located at defined positions within the neural tube. As embryologic development progresses, these neuronal progenitor cells ultimately give rise to distinct classes of mature functional neurons. While some of the molecular mechanisms of neuronal cell specification are known, many of the details of these processes remain unclear. Existing in vitro methods that study neural tissue development fail to produce a neural tube-like tissue architecture, so a need exists to design an advanced technological platform that examines anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral patterning. Researchers at the University of Michigan have successfully invented a microfluidic human neural tube model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). The hPSCs form as a rectangular-shaped adhesive island that self-organizes and develops into a tubular structure containing a single central lumen upon a microfluidic platform. This platform allows for the supplementation of exogenous, orthogonal morphogen gradients that are important for anterior-posterior as well as dorsal-ventral patterning of the neuroepithelial tube, mimicking neural tube development in vivo. Genes critical for neural tube growth, known as HOX genes, that are expressed during embryogenesis to create the appropriate spatial arrangement of the neural tube are expressed in an analogous fashion in this model. Additionally, the hPSCs spontaneously differentiate into neuroepithelial cells within this neurogenic culture condition. This synthetic model therefore mimics the morphology, cell differentiation and cell fate patterning of human neural tube formation to provide an experimental tool for studying its development as well as the effects of toxins and therapeutic agents on its growth.",

    "ip_description": "Discovery of a new molecular subtype of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer. Predicts sensitivity of tumor cells to cell cycle inhibitors and immunotherapy. May eventually be detected in non-invasive samples like urine or circulating tumor cells. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men worldwide, with an incidence that increases greatly with age and that affects 15% of men at some point during their life. The majority of newly diagnosed PCa cases are localized and thankfully have an excellent short term rate of survival. For the approximately 20% of patients who present with advanced or metastatic disease, 5-year survival is less than one-third. The approach to treatment for patients with metastatic or recurrent cancer after primary treatment has been androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), an intervention that reduces circulating testosterone levels to deprive prostate cancer cells their primary stimulus for growth. Still, prostate cancer cells eventually develop resistant mechanisms which allow them to grow in spite of lowered testosterone levels. Patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have historically been treated with salvage cytotoxic chemotherapy or, more recently, newer agents with varying mechanisms of action that only increase survival by a limited number of months. In short, mCRPC remains an incurable disease, and a need exists for molecular predictors of response to existing and future interventions. Researchers have discovered a new molecular subtype of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer which may predict sensitivity of tumor cells to cell cycle inhibitors and immunotherapy. The investigators have discovered that biallelic loss of cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) is enriched in patients with mCRPC when compared to primary prostate cancer. They further demonstrated that CDK12-mutant prostate cancer defines a new molecular subtype of mCRPC, distinct from other established genetic drivers of prostate cancer, which is characterized by focal tandem duplications (FTDs) that lead to increased gene fusions and marked differential gene expression. The focal tandem duplications associated with the loss of CDK12 lead to recurrent gains in several genes with key functions in the cell cycle and DNA replication. Furthermore, CDK12-mutant cancers are highly immunogenic, exhibiting elevated neoantigen burden from gene fusions as well as increased immune infiltrating cells, but display chemokine-mediated mechanisms of immune evasion. Together, these latter two findings are those which suggest that CDK12 status can be used to predict sensitivity of mCRPC patients to cell cycle inhibitors and/or immunotherapy. Future modifications to this discovery could include the detection of CDK12 alterations in non-invasive samples, such as urine or circulating tumor cells, or single-cell sequencing methods.",

    "ip_description": "A topically applied molecule that can promote hair growth or regrowth. Causes an increased proliferation of follicle stem cells. May diminish hair loss from any of the common causes of alopecia. Hair loss, also known as alopecia, is a condition that affects roughly 85% of men and 50% of women by the time they reach their sixth decade. The two main causes for hair loss are androgenic alopecia (AGA) and alopecia areata (AA). AGA is the biggest contributor to hair loss and results in a receding hair line or baldness in males and overall thinning of the hair in women. The mechanism by which AGA causes hair loss in men is hair follicle shrinkage which limits new hair growth, while the processes causing thinning of hair in women is less understood. AA, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disease that affects about 2% of the US population and which is associated hair loss due to inappropriate attacks of the hair follicles by T cells. Hair loss can also result from other medical conditions such as an adverse effect of common cancer treatments, aging, and environmental, and genetic factors. The existing therapies for alopecia are limited and fairly labor intensive. Currently there are only two FDA approved drugs to treat alopecia, both of which come with potentially severe side effects or lackluster results. These therapies must also be used continuously, or the hair loss will resume. Alternatively, hair transplants can be performed by removing hair follicles from an area with dense hair growth and implanting the follicles into tiny slits on the affected area of the head. While many patients experience thicker-looking hair following the transplant, it is not uncommon for patients to still experience continued hair thinning which could require additional follow-up transplants. A need exists for therapies to not only prevent further hair loss, but to also promote new, sustained growth of hair. Researchers at the University of Michigan have discovered that the topical use of a molecule called Dipotassium Bisperoxovanadium dihydrate bpV(pic) can induce hair growth. The molecule is applied in a topical formulation that directs hair growth, or regrowth, to specific sites on the skin. The bpV(pic) molecule inhibits phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), proteins that play a critical role in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. This approach was found to have a positive effect on hair growth in models of both young and older mice. Microscopic evaluation of the effects of bpV(pic) showed an increased proliferation of skin cells and elevated numbers of follicle stem cells at the treated sites. The potential applications of this drug are wide, with reasonable hopes for hair growth resulting from any of the known causes of alopecia.",

    "ip_description": "Cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) selective accumulation in tumor tissues. A versatile and effective platform to reduce imaging signal-to-noise ratio. May provide a means for treatment of cancer with targeted agents. Tumor-targeted imaging is a strategy for in vivo visualization of cancer and is used for accurate diagnosis, staging, and restaging of cancer. Existing imaging tools include positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), ultrasonography, and fluorescence. Contrast materials consist of substances that temporarily enhancing the ability for imaging tools to evaluate bodily structures. However, most of the currently available imaging contrast agents are distributed throughout the body, even in normal healthy tissues. This global uptake results in a low signal-to-noise ratio and causes side effects in some susceptible patients. Tumor-targeting imaging probes have emerged as powerful tools that improve tumor detection sensitivity and accuracy in staging diagnosis and treatment. A need exists to further develop tumor-targeted imaging agents with a high signal to noise ratio that would improve the clinical diagnosis of, and therapeutic options for, cancer. Researchers at the University of Michigan report that cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) selectively accumulate in tumor tissues after systemic administration. Those CDNs found to efficiently collect in tumors include cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) and cyclic di-GMP (CDG). CDNs can be conjugated with cyanine dyes that are commonly used for fluorescent labeling of DNA and RNA, such as Cy7 and Dy547. Using several in vivo animal models of cancer, CDNs and CDN-conjugates have been found to accumulate exclusively within tumors. These features allow the investigators to choose from a diverse library of CDNs for different applications and to conjugate and deliver various cargo molecules for different applications, including imaging, diagnosis, and therapy. CDNs have a short serum half-life and clear rapidly through kidneys, maximizing signal-to-noise ratio while minimizing any potential side effects.",

    "ip_description": "A method for delivering IgA complexed with its antigen to limit allergic responses. Produces a tolerating signal that prevents progression to severe responses. Can be used to treat ongoing allergic and autoimmune responses. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the most abundant antibody in humans, comprising the majority of the immunoglobulin in secretions and second only to immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the circulation. IgA is predominately located in high concentrations in mucous secretions including saliva, milk, tears, and secretions from the respiratory tract, gut, genitourinary tract, and prostate. One of the main functions of IgA is to protect mucosa-lined tissues from microbial invasion and to help maintain immune homeostasis with microbiota. The IgA system integrates with other innate and adaptive immune systems to facilitate that balance. The induction of mucosal immune responses can occur throughout life, but the regulation of these responses is critical to avoid severe inflammation and unwanted immune responses that lead to disease. A need exists to foster methods for prevention of IgA-mediated allergic reactions. Researchers at the University of Michigan report that IgA complexed with its specific antigen can provide a tolerizing signal in animals with an existing allergy response through the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that prevent the progression to chronic and severe responses in the lung and gut blocking asthma-like and food induced anaphylaxis. The investigators propose that development of allergen-specific IgA can be used as a therapy to treat ongoing allergic and autoimmune responses by generating antigen specific Treg cells to control the severity of the ongoing immune responses.",

    "ip_description": "A novel albumin nanoformulation of APG-152 which acts as an antineoplastic agent. Permits aqueous solubility for an agent known to have usefulness against solid tumors. Exhibits synergy with cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and can be used in combined regimens. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is controlled by proteins in the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family which undergo direct binding interactions that regulate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). These reactions lead to the irreversible release of intermembrane space proteins that cause caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis. Many cancer cells are dependent on the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins for their growth, so this series of pathways has been a focus of anti-neoplastic interventions. One goal has been to develop small molecule modulators of the BCL-2 family proteins, and a highly potent investigational small molecule named APG-1252 which binds to the BCL gene family has been studied in this setting. APG-1252 has been shown to have a broad therapeutic potential for treatment of solid tumors, though it has been limited in clinical applications due to its poor aqueous solubility. A need exists to improve the ability of this molecule to be distributed at therapeutic level in vivo. Researchers report that they have synthesized an albumin nanoformulation of APG-1252 which can reach acceptable levels of solubility to act as a therapeutic agent. The size of the nanoformulation can be tuned between various concentrations by changing manufacturing process parameters. The inventors have observed and documented the stability of the formulation, including the stability in solution, the dilution stability, and long-term stability in storage. They also conducted a cytotoxicity study in tumor cells to prove the equivalence of antitumor efficacy between the nanoformulation and free drug. The discovery mimics the experience of the albumin nanoformulation of paclitaxel Abraxene, which has been delivered successfully in the clinical setting for several years. Preclinical studies have shown that APG-1252 alone achieves complete and persistent tumor regression in multiple tumor xenograft models in solid tumor types such as small cell lung cancer (SCLC), colon, breast, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The nanoformulation achieves strong synergy with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that APG-1252 may have a broad therapeutic potential for the treatment of human cancer as a single agent or in combination with other classes of anticancer drugs.",

    "ip_description": "A nanoemulsion adjuvant vaccine that is effective for chronic allergic asthma. Reduces histopathology and disease associated parameters in severe asthma in mice. Employs a mouse model that facilitates chronic allergen-induced airway remodeling. Exposure to indoor allergens is known to exacerbate asthma, with asthma symptoms due to cockroach exposure having been recognized as an incidence in the prevalence of this illness since the 1940s. Cockroach allergen exposure correlates more strongly with asthma morbidity than do exposures to dust mites or pest allergens. Cockroach-derived protease disturbs airway epithelial integrity and leads to an increased penetration of allergen proteins, resulting in activation of innate immune cells that direct cells of the adaptive immune system and lead to the lung inflammation and increased sensitization. The rates of wheezing and asthma-related hospitalizations are higher among children who are skin test positive to cockroach antigen. Still, the specific mechanisms by which these allergens lead to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and loss of function are poorly understood, so a need exists for an improved method to determine the most important mechanistic pathways. Researchers have discovered an approach that employs a clinical grade skin allergen test that has no endotoxin combination and allows outstanding consistency of response. The mouse model they use facilitates chronic allergen-induced airway remodeling that is accompanied by intense peribronchial leukocyte recruitment, mucus hypersecretion, development of AHR, and significant peribronchial and airway thickening. A vaccine using a nanoemulsion adjuvant altered the ongoing immune response by skewing the responses away from the dominant T helper 2 (Th2) cytokine profile. The nanoemulsion vaccinated mice displayed a significantly protected phenotype with improved airway function, reduced mucus production, less airway pathology, and a significant decrease in Th2 induced disease. Thus, the nanoemulsion vaccine provided clinical improvements that may be protective in chronic severe steroid resistant asthmatic disease.",

    "ip_description": "A cocrystal of posaconazole to treat patients with systemic fungal infections. Enhanced pharmaceutical properties including solubility, dissolution, stability, and processability. Particularly useful for patients whose clinical condition limits oral intake of medications. Systemic fungal diseases are typically chronic conditions that develop slowly and result from fungi that live normally in a patient's body or are endemic to the environment. The incidence of fungal infections is highest in tropical countries, though they have become increasingly common as opportunistic infections in immunocompromised hosts in developed countries. Fungal diseases are often confined to typical anatomic sites, and many involve a primary focus in the lung, with more characteristic manifestations of specific fungal infections appearing once the infection spreads from a primary site. Given that many patients suffering from systemic fungal infections are ill and may have gastroparesis or even be comatose, the ability to deliver medication via the oral route may be limited or impossible. As a result, insoluble or sparingly soluble antifungals such as itraconazole and posaconazole are difficult to administer intravenously, limiting their value to these patients. There is a need for crystal forms of anti-fungal medications that can be formulated as suspensions and solid dosage forms with less variability, better water solubility, dissolution, stability, and properties suitable for pharmaceutical processing. Researchers have discovered a cocrystal of posaconazole (posaconazole-4 aminobenzoic acid) which exhibits enhanced pharmaceutical properties including solubility, dissolution, stability, and processability. The invention provides novel soluble multicomponent crystalline systems comprising (a) an organic salt comprising the reaction product of cis intraconazole and an organic or inorganic acid; and (b) an organic solvent. While oral administration of posaconazole products is limited by solubility-pH dependence, the cocrystal mitigates those pH-dependent solubility issues. Cocrystal dissolution in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid achieves concentrations that are 15-fold higher than that achieved with posaconazole crystals. The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising, and processes for making, these crystalline forms. This novel approach can be applied in circumstances where patients with systemic fungal infections are limited their ability to take in medicines orally, or even in those situations where oral intake is not diminished.",

    "ip_description": "A novel approach for location tracking of an ingestible device through the entire GI tract. Provides sensing of several variables such as pH, motility, pressure, and temperature. Useful for circumstances as diverse as the diagnosis of disease and development of new drugs. Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases affect around 60 to 70 million Americans annually, and timely diagnosis of these illnesses can decrease morbidity and mortality. One method for screening and diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases has been the use of an ingestible capsule that recovers samples from distinct regions along the gastrointestinal tract. While the detection of biomarkers from specific regions of the GI tract has been used to provide understanding of these diseases and to diagnose illnesses in individuals, the recovery of these fluid samples remains difficult and the delineation of the anatomic location for the recovered sample may prove uncertain. The traditional method for obtaining GI samples has included placement of specially designed catheters along the alimentary system. This approach is technically challenging, it causes discomfort, it requires medical supervision and anesthesia, and it permits only a limited reach to GI structures distal to the stomach and small intestine. A need exists for a more specific and less complex means by which to sample biomarkers from fluids along the GI tract. Researchers have invented a new approach for location tracking of ingestible devices that can travel along the GI tract and provide sensing of several variables (i.e., pH, motility, pressure, temperature, etc.), imaging, and sampling of specific anatomic sites. This approach uses miniature inertial sensors such as accelerometers embedded in the device to monitor instantaneous acceleration patterns as the instrument travels along the GI tract. The acceleration patterns are compared with distinct motility patterns in different segments of the GI tract to generate accurate location information of the device. This approach can track location of the ingested sampling device without having to use external imaging hardware or to physically confine the subject. Both the tracking function and its use in an ingestible GI device are considered novel technologies associated with this invention. The overall technology has been labeled as the wireless pharmaceutical analysis device (WPAD). The device has been verified _in vitro_ in emulated GI fluids and _in vivo_ using canine models.",

    "ip_description": "A tool for predicting androgen receptor independent castrate prostate cancer (CRPC). Identification of therapeutic targets in the treatment of androgen receptor independent CRPC. A promising biomarker of lineage plasticity risk and tumor aggressiveness. Prostate cancer remains the second most prevalent and the second most deadly cancer in men. The initiation and progression of prostate cancer relies on signaling through the androgen receptor (AR). The treatment of prostate cancer may therefore include androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) which inhibits androgen signaling in tumor cells. One complexity of prostate cancer treatment results from acquired resistance to ADT over time. The ability of prostate cancer cells to grow during ADT signifies the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), with survival in this patient subgroup falling to less than three years. The loss of AR signaling may cause CRPC, providing a focus for research that would elucidate this mechanism for resistance. Studies suggest that up to 15% of CRPC results from a change in behavior of the tumor cells to a different subtype, signifying a circumstance known as lineage plasticity. A need exists to delineate the mechanism that drives prostate cancer cells to become AR-independent. Researchers have identified a gene signature enriched in prostate cancer cells that was associated with a risk for lineage plasticity. The investigators determined that high expression of this genetic signature was strongly associated with poor survival from the time of AR signaling inhibitor treatment. Using Master Regulator Inference analysis and pathway analysis of recovered samples, they also determined that specific transcription factors and pathways linked to stemness were more activated in baseline tumors from patients whose tumors underwent lineage plasticity. Furthermore, this signature was enriched in a patient-derived xenograft that undergoes castration-induced lineage plasticity versus other patient-derived xenografts that do not, strongly suggesting this signature is linked to poor patient outcome and risk of lineage plasticity after AR signaling inhibitor therapy. Through the evaluation of tumor cell resistance to an AR signaling inhibitor enzalutamide (ENZA), the researchers were able to confirm heterogeneity of ENZA resistant tumors. The discovery therefore implicates specific tumor-related genetic factors that predispose prostate cancer to undergo ENZA-induced lineage plasticity.",

Potential avenue of treatment for Clostridoides difficile and other infections. The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) transmembrane protein found in endoplasmic reticulum senses cytosolic double-stranded DNA and cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs). Activation of STING has shown great potential to enhance antitumor immunity through the induction of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The STING pathway in immune cells can specifically lead to the production of type I interferons and the activation of anti-tumor CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Still, the delivery of STING agonists requires optimization through proper drug delivery methods. The field of nanoparticles, or more specifically nanocarriers, as drug delivery methods has been growing for some time. These nanoparticles may be composed of albumin, liposomes, micelles, or lipids. Nanocarriers allow for increased stability of drugs in circulation, packaging of multiple drugs into individual particles for combination therapies, and modifications that increase cell and tissue specificity. Though a wide range of nanocarrier types based have been utilized, a need exists for further refinement of those delivery methods used in the treatment of cancer patients. Researchers have developed additional STING agonists that can be encapsulated into nanoparticles, and which are capable of also storing chemotherapeutic and immune regulatory drugs. The inventors aim to develop not only new STING agonists, but to develop both lipid-based and albumin-based nanocarriers that would deliver STING agonists along with currently available cancer and immune modulatory drugs for combination therapies. Initial studies in mice using an albumin-based nanovaccine carrying an immune stimulator and chemotherapeutic showed the ability to reduce tumor volume after 5 injections. The use of their protein-based nanoparticles shows increased targeting of the lymphatic system leading to better immune responses. And, when compared to other nanoparticles, those made of lipids or serum-derived proteins offer benefits in terms of cost and efficacy of drug delivery in the human body. Additionally, capitalizing on the activation of the STING pathway for the immune response during bacterial and viral infections, the inventors have developed an additional nanovaccine that is capable of enhancing the immune response through STING activation against Clostridoides difficile infections. All told, these advances may provide improvements in the efficacy of both chemotherapy and immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer as well as helping to control an array of infectious diseases.",

    "ip_description": "Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as an early detection method for anaphylaxis. A safe and specific method to monitor outcomes during an oral food challenge. Utilizes an existing and reproducible technology to measure transepidermal water loss. Food allergy (FA) afflicts nearly 5.6 million children in the United States per year and may lead to food anaphylaxis, a potentially fatal whole-body allergic reaction. Anaphylaxis causes the immune system to release a flood of chemicals that can cause decreased blood pressure as well as narrowing of the airways. Signs and symptoms include a rapid, weak pulse, a whole-body skin rash, and nausea with vomiting. The resulting fear of FA in children translates to unnecessary food avoidance which impedes proper nutritional intake and causes intense anxiety for parents and their children. The most common methodologies for evaluating children for FA include assessing skin sensitivity to allergens or measuring blood test components, each of which are associated with false positive rates of more than 30%. The most accurate method for measuring FA is an oral food challenge (OFC) where a child eats the food that may cause anaphylaxis while being monitored for a reaction and treated safely by an allergist. However, in very young children the lack of expressive language delays anaphylaxis symptom detection, impacting challenge cessation and potentially anaphylaxis severity. Therefore, a need exists for an easy and reproducible method for early detection of FA-related anaphylaxis. Researchers at the University of Michigan have proposed the measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as a means to detect the onset of anaphylaxis which causes profound blood vessel dilation creating water loss through the skin. TEWL is already the most widely used objective measurement for assessing the barrier function of skin, with a testing approach that detects the quantity of condensed water that diffuses across a fixed area of stratum corneum to the skin surface per unit time. An existing food allergy oral food challenge biorepository pipeline that includes clinical and biological data will be used to measure TEWL continuously during clinical food allergy oral food challenge resulting in both anaphylaxis and no reaction. First, skin barrier parameters will be defined by assessing threshold that predict anaphylaxis and compared to temporal symptom reports during an oral food challenge. Then, stopping rules will be developed and then deployed in a pilot clinical trial of oral food challenge evaluating whether such stopping rules reduce anaphylaxis incidence or severity over current standard-of-care. Overall, this technology will allow the use of oral food challenge with TEWL-based outcome measurements to be a definitive marker of childhood food allergy and will improve safety of the oral food challenge.",

    "ip_description": "Treatment of cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD) with a biologic inhibitor. An agent that blocks sodium-glucose linked transporter (SGLT) receptors improves liver function and decreases fibrosis in CFLD patients. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetically transmitted disease with a prevalence of 1 in 3500 people living in North America. A mutation which alters transmembrane enzyme function and creates impaired movement of chloride ions across epithelial cell membranes, causing cell surface dehydration and the formation of a thick, sticky mucus. Patients most commonly suffer from lung dysfunction secondary to accumulation of this thick mucus in the airways, leading to lung infections and respiratory failure. However, CF is a multisystem disease which also impacts the epithelium of the pancreas, intestines, liver, and sweat glands. Cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD) affects about 40% of CF patients and accounts for roughly one-third of CF-related deaths. CFLD may present with abnormal liver biochemistry levels, fat accumulation (hepatic steatosis), fat accumulation with inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), cholestasis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. These changes can eventually cause liver failure and death, more commonly in children but increasingly in patients who survive into their adulthood. The specifics of the pathogenesis of CFLD are poorly understood, and less research has been undertaken to address the effects of CF on the liver as compared to the lungs. Therefore, there is a significant need for the identification of novel therapies that specifically help CF patients diagnosed with CFLD to improve liver function, slow or stop progression of liver damage, prevent or delay liver transplantation, and increase overall survival. Researchers at the University of Michigan have discovered a means to treat CFLD by using an inhibitor originally approved for use in patients with diabetes mellitus. Sodium-glucose linked transporter (SGLT) receptors are responsible for glucose absorption in the intestines, kidneys, lungs, liver, and heart. SGLT inhibitors not only regulate glucose levels but also mediate help to mediate inflammation. The inventors of this technology provided animal data revealing that the use of the SGLT1/2 inhibitor Sotagliflozin can promote proper liver function, decrease inflammation, and increase long-term survival. These results are analogous to decreased inflammation, diminished fibrosis, and lower levels of fat accumulation in the livers of humans treated with SGLT inhibitors for obesity-associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Therefore, SGLT inhibitors show promise toward aiding CFLD patients and diminishing the deleterious liver effects caused by CF.",

May provide a means to anticipate and ameliorate anaphylactic episodes. Allergies to certain foods cause reactions mediated by the immune system. In the most severe cases, an allergic reaction to food can lead to a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. The inflammatory cascade leading to anaphylaxis is mediated by stimulation of IgE antibodies and activation of mast cells in the gastrointestinal system. Epithelial cells lining the intestine are normally connected by intracellular junctions which form a tight barrier between the contents of the intestine and the lumen of the gut. These junctions allow for the transfer of nutrients across cell membranes while keeping toxins and bacteria outside of the cells. Any dysfunction or breakdown of these intracellular junctions can create a scenario where food borne substances cause a series of immune-related events which manifest as the allergy. Anaphylaxis is currently diagnosed by the presence of symptoms in a short time frame following exposure to a potential allergen, especially in patients with a previous history of allergic reactions or positive intradermal skin prick testing. A blood test that determines the level of tryptase enzyme may also prove useful, though that measurement is not easily obtained in real time. A need therefore exists for a diagnostic test that confirms anaphylaxis as it occurs. Researchers have discovered that food-induced anaphylaxis in mouse models is associated with the cleavage of proteins associated with the tight junctions, adherent junctions, and desmosomes in the intestinal mucosa. The inventors found that in particular the proteins claudin-1,2,3, and 5, junctional adhesion molecule-A, E-cadherin, desmoglein-2 and desmocollin-2 were cleaved following food-induced anaphylaxis and were mediated by IgE and mast cell activation.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a genetically influenced, life-threatening condition in which a tear forms in one of the blood vessels of the heart. SCAD is also correlated with migraine headaches and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). In its most dangerous manifestation, SCAD can slow or stop blood flow to the heart and cause a heart attack, abnormal heart rhythm, or sudden cardiac death. SCAD is uncommon but occurs suddenly and often in patients without cardiovascular symptoms, particularly in young women. The prevalence of SCAD is difficult to estimate and has likely been under-recognized. A need exists to identify a means by which to detect the risk for SCAD and to estimate the prognosis of patients facing manifestations of the disease. Researchers have identified three distinct genetic loci that are correlated with SCAD. The investigators performed a genome-wide association study for SCAD and found the three involved loci to be PHACTR1, ADAMTSL4, AND LRP1. These three loci are also associated with the incidence of migraine headaches and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). As such, the identification of these loci may provide a means by which to develop better strategies to treat or prevent these illnesses.

    "ip_description": "A combined adjuvant approach that improves influenza vaccine efficacy. An application that mimics the pattern of innate activation during natural infection. A favorable safety profile with options for intranasal or parenteral administration. Current influenza vaccines are limited by low immunogenicity, short duration of protection, and narrow cross-strain efficacy. These vaccines only influence the immune system to create antibodies that are specific to one strain of influenza and therefore fail to induce a more robust cellular immunity. An effective vaccine needs to stimulate a broad-based cellular immune response as well as mucosal immunity. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) are key sensors of virus infection, mediating the transcriptional induction of type I interferons and other genes that collectively establish an antiviral host response. Both viral and host derived RNAs can trigger RLR activation and cause an effective antiviral response, though this response can cause immunopathology if RLR activities are uncontrolled. A need exists for approaches that permit vaccines to induce a more broad-based yet controlled immune response. Researchers have developed a novel method for using two adjuvants which promote adaptive antibody and T-cell responses to various viruses. The additives include a nanoemulsion (NE) based adjuvant as well as an RNA-based RIG-I agonist. The oil-in-water NE and a synthetic RNA from the Sendai virus (IVT DI) can individually elicit protective immunity to influenza via distinct mechanisms, though the use of both can cause a broader and optimized immune response. Together, the combined NE/RNA adjuvant contains agonists for multiple key innate receptors, allowing it to target multiple key antiviral pathways and magnify their activation. The NE has an intrinsic ability to inactivate enveloped viruses while maintaining conformational antigen epitopes. It also is an antigen carrier which can facilitate cellular uptake and processing. IVT DI activates the RIG-I receptor and induces type-I interferon and TH1 immunity. The adjuvants produce a response that appears to be synergistic rather than additive. The NE/RNA can be formulated for use with both a recombinant protein and whole virus-based antigens, allowing for mucosal or parenteral routes of administration.",

Induces memory T-cell responses that act synergistically with immune checkpoint blockers. Gut microbiotas secrete small molecular weight metabolites that can influence growth, development, and reproduction of other beneficial organisms as well as increasing communication between cells. Microbial metabolites have been identified as potentially being therapeutic in diseases as varied as allergies, obesity, GI tract maladies, and cancer. Initial clinical studies have suggested that microbial metabolites, including tryptophan, short-chain-fatty acids, and bile acids, may act as the potential link among gut microbiota, tumor cells, and systemic immune response. Studies in preclinical tumor models and in cancer patients have demonstrated that the composition of the intestinal microbiota influences the effectiveness of anticancer drugs. Gut microbiotas are specifically linked to the response rate to immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) in cancer patients. These microbial metabolites may act as a link among gut microbiota, tumor cells, and systemic immune response. However, studies to this point have failed to reveal the causal relationship between microbial metabolites and therapeutic efficacy. In particular, it remains unclear whether these beneficial metabolites, also known as postbiotic, can synergize with specific ICB. Thus, a need exists for the development of microbial metabolite-based postbiotic formulation with controlled release for improved anti-tumor T cell immunity in ICB therapy. Researchers have discovered that inulin, a widely consumed orally administered dietary fiber, can serve as an effective antimetabolite in treating cancer. Inulin modulates the gut microbiome to increase metabolites of short-chain-fatty-acids 3,4-dihydroxybensoate (DHB) and 3-methylhistidine. These metabolites can induce central memory T cell differentiation, improve T cell survival, and stimulate the anti-tumor activity of a known checkpoint inhibitor named anti-programmed cell death protein-1.

    "ip_description": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a X-linked disease that leads to progress muscle weakening and death. Researchers have created a mouse model lacking mucolipin 1 (TPRML1), causing muscular defects similar to DMD. Increasing TPRML 1 function ameliorates muscle weakness symptoms in these mice, suggesting a potential treatment of DMD in humans. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, X-linked disease with a prevalence of 18,000 cases in the United States. The illness is caused by the loss of dystrophin, a structural protein that connects muscle cells to the extracellular matrix to stabilize muscle fibers. The primary symptom of DMD is muscle weakness, which usually presents first in the hips, thighs, and shoulders, and then later in the arms, legs, and trunk. In the final stages of the disease, respiratory muscles and the heart become weakened, and death ensues. Life expectancy for these patients historically has been limited to early adulthood, though improving technologies for cardiac and respiratory support have extended the lives of some DMD patients into their fourth or fifth decade. Treatment options for DMD are limited and primarily focused on the management of symptoms rather than addressing the underlying cause of the disease. The current therapeutic approaches for DMD patients include corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and maintain muscle strength, physical therapy to strengthen and maintain muscle function for as long as possible, medications to treat dilated cardiomyopathy, and mechanical assistive breathing devices. A need exists for a DMD treatment that addresses the causes of the disease rather than merely managing symptoms. Researchers have generated mice lacking mucolipin 1 (TRPML 1), a lysosomal calcium channel protein that regulates lysosomal exocytosis which, when mutated, causes muscular defects phenotypically similar to DMD. Pharmacologic activation of TRPML 1 improves muscle function in this mice model, suggesting a potential therapeutic agent for patients with DMD by upregulation of mucolipin 1. This transgenic overexpression or pharmacological activation of ML1 in vivo facilitates sarcolemma repair and alleviates the dystrophic phenotype in both skeletal and cardiac muscles in mice. The hallmark dystrophic features of DMD, including myofiber necrosis, central nucleation, fibrosis, elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, reduced muscle force, and impaired motor ability, are all ameliorated by increasing ML1 activity. Hence, the present work indicates that manipulating lysosome function by targeting lysosomal calcium channels represents a promising approach to treating DMD and related muscle diseases.",

    "ip_number": "7702",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) remains the mainstay of treatment for patients with stroke. Delivery of tPA beyond a 3-to-4-hour therapeutic window can cause bleeds and worsen outcomes. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition can extend the time frame for tPA effectiveness. Stroke, or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality with limited therapeutic options. The current standard of care for patients with moderate to severe ischemic stroke is thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This intervention can significantly improve neurological outcome if given within 3 to 4 hours of stroke onset, however tPA delivery after this therapeutic window causes vascular changes that cause bleeding and worsen patient outcomes. The mechanism for this hemorrhage is thought to be related to the cleavage of an inactive form of platelet derived growth factor C (PDGF-C) to an active form which increases brain vascular permeability. In patients who do not present to a medical facility within a short time after the onset of symptoms, clinicians are therefore unfortunately relegated mostly to providing supportive care. A need exists to better understand and prevent tPA induced hemorrhage with the goal of improving and extending the time frame over which thrombolytic therapy may be useful for stroke patients. Researchers at the University of Michigan propose that delivery of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors prior to or concurrent with tPA can significantly extend the window during which tPA can be given to a stroke patient, thereby facilitating a faster and more complete recovery for those who do not present to a healthcare facility in the first 3 to 4 hours after the onset of symptoms. PKC inhibitors block PDGF-C cell receptors and can restore the integrity of the blood brain barrier (BBB), lower the risk of hemorrhagic transformation, and reduce infarct size. Protein kinase C inhibitors have already been known to control vascular permeability in blinding eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, and their effectiveness in preventing intracerebral hemorrhage has been reported in mouse models of thrombolytic stroke. The goal moving forward will be to use this approach to broaden the population of stroke patients who benefit from the favorable effects of tPA treatment.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "A means to provide reliable quantitative assessment of tooth displacement. Software that measures and evaluates 3-D images from intra-oral scanners. Reproducible accuracy over consecutive visits as well as between different users. Dentists have commonly relied on impression techniques and a sophisticated dental laboratory to generate the three-dimensional models of dental tissues. Intra-oral (IO) scanners have been developed to overcome these requirements. Intra-oral scanners work by projecting a light source onto the dental arches and collecting images that are then processed by the scanning software, generating cloud points, which are triangulated to create a 3D surface model. Oral scanners help create 3D models of teeth, denture bridges, and other implants, plan surgical procedures, store patient data, design oral healthcare items, and in education and training. Up to this point the use of IO scanners to determine tooth mobility has been limited, and those measures are more commonly calculated by applying pressure to move the tooth backwards and forwards or by visual inspection. Slight tooth mobility has been observed in healthy teeth, however mobility beyond a physiologic limit diagnoses periodontal disease, estimates prognosis, and is a useful marker to measure the success or failure of periodontal treatment. A need exists to develop a method to more accurately and reproducibly document tooth displacement that results from trauma from occlusion, periodontitis, cysts, or tumors. Researchers at the University of Michigan have invented a means to provide reliable quantitative assessment of tooth displacement that measures mobility by comparing reference points of the moving tooth and non-moving tissues in the oral cavity. The software evaluates three-dimensional images obtained by IO scanners which capture tooth positions in physiological and non-physiological circumstances. The invention is a non-invasive technique that collects data of tooth mobility without the need to intervene with invasive analog tools, such as periodontal or exploratory probes, minimizing the impact of the operator technique and experience on the outcome measure. Data evaluation shows reproducible accuracy of measures between the same user over consecutive visits as well as between different users. The overall displacement of the tooth yields a quantitative outcome to be used for diagnosis, planning, assessing tooth prognosis, determining the need for intervention, communicating results between different labs, and evaluating patients' progress with and without treatment. The details of these changes in tooth mobility can also be used to track orthodontic adjustments over time. The approach can be utilized in any type of dental clinic.",

    "ip_description": "A digital, handheld device to monitor progression of age-related macular degeneration. Effective for patients with differing degrees of visual acuity and varying severities of AMD. Allows patients to be notified if there were changes which would necessitate an appointment. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative disease of the retina and the leading cause of adult blindness in industrialized countries, affecting 190 million people worldwide. When left untreated, AMD results in central vision loss. Progression of AMD to blindness is preventable given that proper treatment is administered within a narrow window of time. The current standard of care requires patients with AMD be monitored via periodic physician assessments at intervals as short as every three to six months. Still, even with appropriate surveillance, significant changes in AMD may occur between these appointments, causing patients to lose their optimal window for initiating treatment to prevent blindness. While additional methods to monitor this condition are needed, there are currently no effective at-home solutions to help patients seek treatment within this window. The gap in active surveillance necessitates an affordable, remote solution for monitoring AMD. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a digital, handheld, standalone device that delivers at home monitoring of AMD progression. The KalEYEdoscope consists of an injection-molded shell that houses a graduated focusing mechanism, two tactile buttons, a battery, a processing unit, and a small screen on which the software component is displayed. The focusing mechanism allows for examination of patients with differing visual acuity, and it is efficacious in differentiating patients with varying severities of AMD. The device is monocular and therefore eliminates potential filling-in bias from the contralateral, less-affected eye. The software component of the device identifies a patient's minimum distortion-detection threshold (MDDT) longitudinally over a sequence of trials. This invention can therefore be readily incorporated into the user's daily routine and is designed to remotely and accurately identify when the patient should seek treatment for AMD.",

    "ip_description": "Use of luminal esophageal retraction probe that monitors temperature. Provides the ability to move the esophagus away from the atrial wall. Measures and decreases esophageal toxicity due to cardiac ablation. The use of endoscopic ultrasound with transesophageal catheter ablation has emerged as a common and effective strategy for managing symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) which is refractory to drug therapy. The procedure does not normally cause toxicity, though thermal injury to the esophagus may occur, especially when performing ablation for lesions located on the posterior wall of the left atrium. These instances of esophageal injury can range in severity from mild erythema to ulcer formation, with the rare potential to progress into an atrial esophageal fistula. Though the rate of esophageal fistula is less than 0.5% of patients following this procedure, sequelae can include significant morbidity or death. Also, thermal-mediated damage to the vagal plexus can result in gastric dysmotility and gastroparesis. Several existing techniques can be utilized to minimize damage to the esophagus, including luminal esophageal temperature (LET) monitoring, the use of a lower power or duration ablation, irrigating the esophagus with cold water, or mechanical esophageal deviation. Given limitations to each of these approaches, a need exists to improve the protection of the esophagus during cardiac ablation procedures. Researchers at the University of Michigan have created a luminal esophageal retraction probe that can monitor tissue properties including temperature and move the esophagus away from the atrial wall. The invention provides the ability to visualize three-dimensional changes of the esophageal wall, it measures underlying tissue properties caused by thermal effects to detect tissue damage, and it documents esophageal wall deformation caused by mechanical pressures created by the ablation catheter while inside the heart. These capabilities will allow physicians to better determine the location of the ablation catheter in relation to the esophageal wall and will also provide improved early detection of thermal damage while quantifying thermal damage.",

Collects larger sample volumes over time to yield higher CTC yield and improved diagnosis. Technological advances have piqued an interest in the optimal ways to identify circulating tumor cells (CTCs) via a liquid biopsy of patient serum. CTCs are a rare subset of cells found in the blood of patients with solid tumors that may be destroyed by the body's immune system or end up seeding metastatic sites. The ability to separate CTCs from blood can diagnose cancer, delineate prognosis, and provide a guide for treatment. The exceedingly low concentration of CTCs in blood makes it difficult for existing techniques to identify those cells. The use and application of microfluidic devices has grown greatly over the past decades and offers hope in setting. Microfluidic devices allow for the miniaturization of complex fluid manipulation in small, inexpensive packages. As a result, many microfluidic devices have been presented as lower cost and smaller in size alternatives to more common laboratory analytical equipment. Still, a need exists to overcome some of the limitations of existing microfluidic systems to measure CTCs more efficiently in patient serum. Researchers at the University of Michigan have invented a cell focusing device and pump control system for circulating tumor cell (CTC) capture. The mechanism allows the patient to use a wearable 'watch'-like device to capture CTCs in real-time. This approach collects larger sample volumes over time than a simple blood draw to yield higher CTC yield and improved diagnosis. The invention can model and control pressure at the inlet of a microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LOC) device using simple peristaltic pump and sensing components. The pump is capable of compensating for varying resistance of the LOC device caused by changes in the density and viscosity of blood. This novel approach shows promise in detecting CTCs, and future modifications of the system architecture and associated model will permit more sophisticated viscosity identification and control designs for designs for increasingly accurate measures.",

    "ip_description": "An ultra-low energy photoacoustic microscopy system and its data processing method. High quality imaging of retinal vessels by using laser energy at 1% of listed safety limits. Comprehensive longitudinal safety evaluation demonstrating no laser damage. The optical transparency of the eye permits direct imaging of the retina which allows an ophthalmologist to diagnose a variety of diseases such as macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusions. Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) is an imaging modality that can non-invasively explore the optical absorption properties in biological tissues with high spatial resolution and deep penetration. PAM uses a laser beam to create localized thermoelastic tissue expansion which causes the emission of waves that are detected by ultrasound transducers to provide optical absorption information. PAM must be used with caution as an imaging methodology since it exposes light-sensitive structures such as photoreceptors to lasers. For this reason, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) lists safety limits for laser exposure for the ocular imaging system. Though existing PAM techniques create exposures lower than the ANSI published safety requirements, laser safety remains a major concern when using this technology on patients. A need exists to improve the sensitivity of PAM to further decrease the chances for iatrogenic retinal damage. Researchers at the University of Michigan developed an ultra-low energy photoacoustic microscopy system and data processing method that achieves high quality imaging of retinal vessels with a laser energy at 1% of the ANSI safety limit. The sensitivity of the PAM system was improved through the use of a multi-channel digitizer for signal acquisition, two stage amplification, and a newly designed high sensitivity needle transducer. By drastically enhancing its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the performance of this system worked with significantly reduced laser fluence when it was examined via experiments on a clinically relevant rabbit eye model in vivo. The safety of this system has been validated by histopathology, fluorescein angiography (FA), and fundus photography, paving the road toward clinical application.",

A novel approach that differs from the reliance on the span of substantia nigra (STN) traversed. Yields a predicted 8% improvement in motor outcomes following STN DBS. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical procedure for Parkinson's Disease, can help ease motor symptoms and decrease medication needs in some people. The process of DBS involves implanted electrodes that stimulate specific areas in the brain to manage the manifestations of Parkinson's Disease including essential tremor, dystonia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. A major challenge in the performance of deep brain stimulation surgery is the selection of an optimal surgical trajectory. Choosing among several anatomic trajectories is typically done by selecting the approach traversing the longest span of the affected part of the brain, called the substantia nigra (STN). A need exists to determine the optimal stimulation region along a given electrode trajectory through the brain when performing DBS. Researchers at the University of Michigan have demonstrated a method that scores trajectories for DBS according to electrophysiological recordings. The investigators integrated microelectric recordings (MER) and spatial information about optimal stimulation volumes (VTAs) to develop a patient-specific MER-based metric to evaluate the effectiveness of a DBS trajectory more accurately than an STN span metric. Their data suggests that in an appropriately chosen patient group the objective method for choosing trajectory would improve clinical outcomes by 8%. The method also reduces the complexity of trajectory selection and may speed up and simplify STN DBS surgery for neurosurgeons.",

    "ip_description": "A non-invasive cervical cerclage device to prevent premature birth or pregnancy loss. Useful for pregnant mothers with cervical insufficiency or short cervix syndromes. Higher efficacy preventing prematurity than progesterone formulations. About 10% of babies born in the United States are born preterm, defined as delivery prior to 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. Painless dilation of the cervix before 37 weeks of pregnancy is called 'cervical insufficiency' and is a risk factor for pregnancy loss and preterm birth. Women with a 'short cervix' in pregnancy are also at risk for preterm birth. The current 'gold standard' treatment is an invasive surgical procedure done under regional or general anesthesia that allows the placement of suture in a purse-string fashion into the cervical tissue and tied down to keep the cervix closed and provide structural support to prolong pregnancy. Due to the invasive nature of this procedure, it puts the patient at risk of rupturing the fetal membranes, vaginal bleeding, and infection, any of which can lead to preterm delivery or pregnancy loss. A University of Michigan researcher has developed a non-invasive suture deployment device that delivers structural support to the cervix in women with cervical insufficiency and short cervix. The device helps patients avoid the risks of an invasive surgery while still supporting the pregnancy and keeping the cervix from opening or shortening prematurely. Women with a history of cervical insufficiency or short cervix will be candidates for the device. The device will be applicable to pregnancy care in nations worldwide. The device exerts 5-6 pounds of pressure on the cervix to support it structurally, achieving the same pressure exerted by existing surgical techniques, though without space restrictions. The device also provides feedback to the user when it has exerted maximal tension, using a red and green indicator, and it is inhibited from exerting excessive pressure through a safety mechanism. It eliminates the need to take a patient to the operating room or to place her under anesthesia, limiting patient risk and diminishing healthcare costs.",

    "ip_description": "A low-cost, rapidly deployable interface for safe sample collection. Designed for Ghana, yet reproducibly applicable to nations worldwide. Simple, reproducible design with minimal manufacturing and assembly needs. The residents of Ghana face increased risk of infections due to pathogens such as COVID-19 because of overcrowding in neighborhoods with limited access to health services, soap, water, and proper sanitation. Though Ghana established 'pop-up' COVID-19 testing sites, the number of sites remained insufficient due to an overarching lack of resources. Symptomatic patients therefore commonly travel to hospitals for testing, increasing the concentration of crowds and a risk for increased viral transmission. Furthermore, there is a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers in Ghana. This shortage requires practices that minimize the use of disposable PPE to save supplies for in-patient facilities. This problem is not specific to Ghana but is applicable to many countries worldwide. Therefore, a need exists for a low-cost and rapidly deployable interface between patients and healthcare workers that will minimize the use of disposable PPE and allow for safe patient sample collection in low-resource community settings. Investigators have developed a low-cost, rapidly deployable interface for safe sample collection. This device consists of a PVC frame, a small table in front of the device, armhole extensions, foot extensions, and an acrylic panel. The device can hold an icebox for vial storage, a non-contact thermometer, and sample vials. Foot extensions can be held down by sandbags to prevent the device from tipping and slipping when faced with high wind conditions or rough terrain. The armhole extensions allow the assembler to pull gloves through the armholes and wrap them around the extensions using a hose clamp, permitting the user to attach gloves to the device and ensure that they stay in place while also allowing them to switch out gloves. The design utilizes an acrylic panel that covers the front top half of the device so that the patients and caregivers can see each other while still having a physical barrier between them. The panel is fixated is physically attached in a way that removes the needs to make screw holes into the acrylic. This approach saves time on manufacturing and assembly, and it also saves money by removing the need to buy screws, nuts, bolts, and U-brackets. Further modifications could include incorporating an acrylic or a solid barrier around the entire device, creating a mechanism for the device to fold down to ease portability, and adding a power source.",

    "ip_description": "Novel predictive and pharmacodynamic serum biomarkers for patients with sepsis. Identifies sepsis patients most likely to respond to treatment with L-carnitine. Provides point of care diagnostics to permit personalized medicine in sepsis. Sepsis represents the body's response to infection and has become an increasingly common health-care problem that is responsible for 250,000 deaths every year. Despite advancements in sepsis treatment, its management is complicated by a lack of proper diagnostic tools and effective therapies. The development of novel methods for detection and treatments for sepsis has been inhibited by a limited understanding of proper patient selection as well as an imprecise knowledge of medication titration and dosing. Although pharmacogenomics has been employed to predict drug response in sepsis patients, the results of this approach have yielded only intermittent success. Sepsis is characterized by metabolic disturbances, and preliminary data suggests a relative L-carnitine, a branched non-essential amino acid, deficiency may contribute to metabolic dysfunction. Clinical studies show that traditional phenotyping (e.g., sequential organ failure score (SOFA)) alone is not sufficient to identify carnitine responsive sepsis patients. Thus, there is a growing need for biomarkers that can indicate both the utility of L-carnitine and titration of the dosage. Researchers at the University of Michigan have utilized metabolomics to successfully differentiate sepsis patients as either 'carnitine responders' or 'carnitine non-responders' as a marker for potential treatment response. The blood metabolites used in the approach pioneered by these investigators include detection of ketone bodies, acetylcarnitine (AC), and carnitine (C) as well as a calculation of the AC:C ratio. Clinicians can leverage this data to deliver L-carnatine therapy to appropriate patients early in their clinical course when the intervention has a better chance to provide a favorable response. In general, 'low ketone' L-carnitine-treated patients have significantly better survival than 'high ketone' L-carnitine-treated patients. Additionally, metabolites of L-carnitine that change over time can identified and may be used to monitor the drug's effectiveness and any signs of adverse drug reactions.",

Cancer immunotherapy is designed to induce or augment the body's immune response such that the immune system will specifically target cancer cells for destruction. Approaches to induce an anti-tumor immune response can be divided into non-antigen specific and antigen-specific categories. Cancer immunotherapy using dendritic cells (DCs) has therapeutic efficacy in patients with advanced or metastatic disease, though only a fraction of treated patients show a sustained and significant response. Current approaches either use tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) or tumor extracts to generate DC vaccines or effector T cells used in adoptive transfer therapies. However, most tumors show great heterogeneity and consist of cells that vary in their antigen expression profiles; thus, not all cells may not be effectively targeted by such bulk approaches. In particular, cancer stem cells (CSCs) are undifferentiated and do not express TAAs, and therefore evade such treatments. These cells, however, are also resistant to standard chemotherapy and are responsible for tumor metastasis and relapse. Thus, specific targeting of CSCs can provide a significant advancement in treatment of many types of cancers. Researchers at the University of Michigan Department of Surgery found that targeting cancer-initiating cells via dendritic-cell vaccination provides significant anti-tumor immunity. This CSC-targeted therapy is specifically designed for patients previously treated with standard chemotherapy or radiation, as these treatments have been shown to reduce overall tumor size and increase the proportion of cancer stem cells. This technology presents a therapeutic modality that may provide more efficacious and sustained response and improve patient progression-free survival. These dendritic cell vaccines are antigen presenting cells that can be loaded with tumor-specific antigens in vitro and injected into patients. They activate adaptive immunity and induce antigen-specific immune responses. Through adoptive T cell therapy, cancer-reactive T cells are harvested from the patient, expanded through polyclonal stimulation or exposure to specific agents, and infused back into patients. Based on studies of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and brain tumors could also benefit from this approach as elevated ALDH activity has been found in all these CSCs, so these CSCs could potentially be isolated. It is also possible that other types of cancer could benefit from this therapy, where ALDH activity has not yet been investigated. In addition to using this technology as an active immune therapy, it can also be used to identify additional antigens differentially expressed on CSCs that can then be specifically targeted by pharmacologic agents.",

    "ip_description": "An improved method for image processing in Lissajous scanning. Corrects for drift in phase delay and produces clearer images. Better image reconstruction in medical and non-medical applications. Advancements in single pixel imaging have led to medical innovations in many areas including endomicroscopy, which can perform an 'optical biopsy' using properties of light to make instant diagnoses with an endoscope. Images are acquired with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) scanners which scan an object in a spiral pattern and collect the sequence of reflected light. The evaluation of raw data measuring the intensity of light from different points on the object plane may deviate as it is recorded by the MEMS scanner, leading to poor quality images. To date, attempts to counteract this solution have included temperature-based calibration an on-chip capacitive sensing, but these methods are not reproducible and present major limitations in space constrained applications such as endomicroscopy. Researchers have created a method for image processing which predicts the phase and corrects for phase errors to provide improved image quality for Lissajous scanning, which has many optical applications including biomedical imaging, scanning probe microscopes, and single pixel cameras. This invention uses image processing techniques that can accurately predict the phases along different axes to produce more accurate images. The phase can be predicted based on the degree of sharpness or blurriness of the image, with the resulting image sharpest when reconstructed with an accurate phase. The image is reconstructed multiple times by sweeping through different phases in the x and y directions to find the sharpest image. The process also corrects for drift in phase delay. This approach is the first use of such a method to correct for drift in phase delay arising from dynamics of MEMS scanning mirrors, or other compact scanners that might be used to produce a Lissajous pattern.

    "ip_description": "A molecular imaging study useful for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Measures the presence of the cell surface adhesion receptor CD44. Provides highly specific binding to facilitate various technological applications. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer and often presents as an advanced, incurable illness. Given that HCC is usually asymptomatic in its early phases and is not amenable to effective screening with existing technologies, there is a need to develop novel diagnostic options for this disease. Researchers have discovered a molecular imaging strategy for HCC that can potentially improve diagnostic performance. They have developed a method to detect and measure the presence of CD44, a multistructural and multifunctional molecule involved in cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell migration, angiogenesis, presentation of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors to the corresponding receptors, and docking of proteases at the cell membrane, as well as in signaling for cell survival. This cell surface molecule is thought to be linked to cancer, and its elevated expression in HCC correlates with increased rates of metastasis, tumor recurrence, resistance to treatment, and decreased survival. The investigators employ a molecular imaging strategy that fluorescently labels a peptide specific for CD44 and which may be used for real time, in vivo imaging. The technology is sensitive, simple to use, and safe in its delivery. Specific binding to CD44 has been confirmed via cell staining, knockdown, and competition assays. This cell surface adhesion receptor is highly expressed in many cancers and regulates metastasis via recruitment of CD44 to the cell surface. Its interaction with appropriate extracellular matrix ligands promotes the migration and invasion processes involved in metastases. CD44 has also been identified as a marker for several types of stem cells. Furthermore, uptake by HCC tumors was shown to be successful in a mouse model with radiographic confirmation of uptake by orthoptic HCC tumors, thereby showing tumor size, shape, and boundaries. And notably, significantly greater peptide binding to human HCC specimens was observed compared to normal human liver specimens. These results demonstrate the peptide is high specific binding to CD44 in orthotopic HCC imaging. This peptide can be used clinically for early cancer detection, image-guided resection, risk stratification, monitoring of therapeutic efficacy and can potentially be used for targeting drug delivery by labeling nanocarriers to achieve site-specific drug delivery of high payloads.",

    "ip_description": "Higher doses of valproic acid (VPA) improve survival in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Both higher total doses as well as higher dose rates favorably affect outcomes in a swine model. The investigators increased dosing while avoiding deleterious cardiac effects of VPA. Injuries are the leading cause of death for young people in the United States, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in 2.8 million emergency department visits per year. In current military conflicts, TBI is also a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, current treatments for TBI are mostly supportive in nature, without any specific therapy that can improve survival or attenuate the extent of brain damage. Valproic acid (VPA), long used as an anti-epilepsy medication, has been shown to improve survival following lethal hemorrhage, polytrauma, septic shock, ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), and TBI. VPA is a histone deacetylase inhibitor, and the mechanism of action by which it improves survival is thought to result from its ability to cause acetylation of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. The current FDA approved dose is 20-60 mg/kg, while the current regulatory label suggests intravenous infusion at concentrations <100 mg/mL at a minimum infusion duration of 60-minutes. Delivery of higher doses raise concerns about drug toxicity and adverse effects. Still, existing data regarding the potential benefits to a more accelerated dose delivery suggests the need for additional research into this approach. Researchers have discovered that high dose valproic acid (VPA) shows survival benefits when delivered via intravenous infusion in a swine model of lethal hemorrhage, polytrauma, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Previous studies using intravenous dosing of VPA at a rate of about 140 mg/kg to healthy human volunteers shows tolerability. This dose of VPA can improve neurocognitive outcomes following TBI that decreases hemorrhagic shock, neural apoptosis, and brain inflammation while promoting neural plasticity. The current investigation reveals that survival was improved with higher total doses and an increased dose rate delivery of VPA. The investigators suggest an ability to overcome the potentially deleterious cardiovascular effects of VPA by creating a drug-delivery autoinfusion device that contains a concentrated and therefore lower volume version of valproate, that is self-contained, and which permits a controlled rate of delivery. VPA is also known to improve survival in lethal models of sepsis by helping to attenuate end organ injury caused by shock. In summary, the described approach reveals the survival benefit of a single dose of VPA given early after injury as demonstrated in a model of hemorrhage and polytrauma.",

    "ip_description": "A device which increases the strength of a sternal closure. Plugs cannulated over the sternal wire abut the anterior and posterior sternal tables. Results in decreased erosion of sternal wires through bone and decreased needle hole bleeding. The median sternotomy is the preferred option for cardiac surgical operations and is performed over 700,000 times annually in the United States. Sternal closure most commonly involves fixation with steel wire because of its low cost and simplicity. Sternal wires are attached to steel needles which are driven through the sternum before they are twisted together to close the sternum. The trauma caused by the wire passing through the sternal bone and parasternal soft tissues can create needle hole bleeding, which occurs in 5% to 9% of cases and is one of the main reasons for reoperation. Sternal needle hole bleeding may be addressed by placing sutures around each of the areas of hemorrhage, but this is a time consuming and unpleasant task. Alternatively, a surgeon may use a hemostatic agent like thrombin to diminish the risk of bleeding, with mixed results. Use of standard sternal wires can result in erosion of wire through the sternal bone, resulting in separation of the sternal halves which can lead to an unpleasant sensation of 'sternal clicking' or, worse, to partial or total separation of the sternum, and, frequently, to infection. This requires re-operation. University of Michigan researchers have created a device that decreases sternum needle hole bleeding after a sternotomy, thereby lessening the intraoperative use of blood products, decreasing time in the operating room, and diminishing the need for re-operation. The researchers propose a sternal wire that incorporates a stiff plug that abuts the posterior surface of the sternum and which is pulled firmly against the needle hole when the wires are tightened prior to closure. This novel sternal closure wire system mitigates complications associated with wire needle hole bleeding, diminishes sternal wire erosion, and counteracts insufficient sternal construct stiffness. The plugs serve to tamponade bleeding without the need for the excessive use of suture ligation, cautery, hemostatic agents, or bone wax. Sternal wires are augmented with grommet-like plugs that tamponade needle hole bleeding and which distribute the force of the sternal wire over a larger surface area of bone and soft tissue, thus reducing the tendency for the wires to erode. One plug should be used for each needle hole. The use of this device requires just over two minutes of additive procedure time compared to sternal wires, far less than the estimates of up to twenty minutes spent inspecting and managing needle holes during a cardio thoracic procedure. This approach leads to a profound decrease in adverse events and costs associated with increased operating room time, subsequent re-operation episodes, and complications associated with sternal separation and infection.",

    "ip_description": "Covid-19 causes hypercoagulability due to increased platelet-derived tissue factor (TF). Dysfunction in immune-related coagulation can increase morbidity and mortality. A new assay measures TF expression to identify at-risk hospitalized patients. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has infected millions of people around the globe. The cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rate in the United States is reported to be 170 per 100,000, with about 20% of hospitalized patients suffering thrombosis. The hypercoagulability state in COVID-19 patients is manifested by an increase in platelet activation and platelet-dependent tissue factor (TF) expression in monocytes. Tissue factor is a cell surface protein that triggers blood clotting in normal hemostasis, though its inappropriate stimulation can cause abnormal clotting events including deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and intra-catheter thrombosis. Dysfunction in immune-mediated coagulation can lead to increased COVID-19 mortality due to myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Increased platelet activation and platelet-dependent tissue factor (TF) expression in monocytes of COVID patients at the time of hospital admission is predictive of patients' outcomes. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed an assay to measure increased tissue factor expression and activity, identifying patients at risk for general and COVID-19 related thrombosis. Measurement of tissue factor expression at the time of hospital admission can provide a means for practitioners to anticipate and initiate early treatment of life-threatening thromboses. While the available data confirms that circulating tissue-factor is elevated in Covid-19 patients, this technology measures tissue factor expression and activity in monocytes by using a combination of mass cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques. The results of this assay are reproducible, they are not influenced by medication use, and they are readily available. They may therefore fill an important niche for use in newly hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Additionally, those who have recovered from an initial COVID-19 infection are known to have continued increases in monocyte populations and overexpression of TF, suggesting that residual immune dysfunction may predispose patients to immune-related thrombotic events and may justify surveillance.",

    "ip_description": "A device to measure microbial types and concentrations in corneal infections. Utilizes two monochrome scientific cameras to facilitate visualization of infection. The absolute intensity of the fluorescent images correlates with microbial concentration. Microbial keratitis is a common cause of corneal opacities and monocular blindness in developing countries. Rural agricultural communities in low- and middle-income countries are at a greater risk of infection due to corneal abrasions from agricultural activities, manual labor, and domestic work. The main cause of corneal infections in developed countries such as the United States is trauma from contact lens usage. These infections may be difficult to diagnose, especially in the absence of an ophthalmologic clinician. Historically, evaluation for infection has depended on gram staining and culture of corneal samples, a process which has suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. Delayed diagnosis correlates with formation of corneal ulcers and an increased risk for vision loss. Researchers at the University of Michigan have designed a device that uses two monochrome scientific (CMOS) cameras which use readily available components from optics and optomechanics manufacturers to facilitate imaging of corneal infections. The design consists of appropriate filters, a fixed-wavelength LED module, a set of dichroic beam splitters, and an aspheric lens that is shared by both cameras. The LED module directs UV emissions into the patient's eye using a beam splitter, exciting fluorescence from any microbes present in the eye and dividing them into two wavelength bands. These images are subsequently imaged using the aspheric lens. The relative intensity of the fluorescent images helps to define the microbial species by detecting tracer molecules such as NADH and FAD, chemicals that take part in chemical metabolism. Additionally, the absolute intensity of the fluorescent images correlates with microbial concentration. A software tool will be developed to help perform these analyses.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "A device to improve effectiveness and safety of gaining vascular access. Allows a single use to maintain ultrasound visualization throughout placement of lines. The device may be adapted for use in other procedures such as chest tube placement. The ability to efficiently and safely gain vascular access is important for the administration of vasoactive agents and other life sustaining therapies for patients managed in an emergency department or a critical care unit. The Seldinger technique for obtaining central venous access was developed in the 1950's and has, with only minor modifications, remained the standard of care ever since. Limitations of the Seldinger technique include an inability to actively visualize the guidewire by ultrasound as it is advanced into the blood vessel. This blind passage technique during the transition from syringe aspiration to guidewire insertion may lead to an incorrect placement of the guidewire outside the target vessel. This error can cause procedural failure or deleterious effects such as neurovascular injury, arteriovenous fistula, or hematoma formation. Factors which increase complexity in successfully gaining vascular access include patient factors such as larger body habitus, limited mobility, and abnormal vascular anatomy. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a device that would serve as a single use adjunct to existing central and arterial line kits. The device accommodates the needle, guidewire, and syringe contained in procedure kits, and it provides a means for a single user to maintain ultrasound visualization during placement. The invention consolidates capabilities for aspiration and wire passage into a one-handed device that includes a pistol grip handle to improve needle control and ergonomics. A trigger mechanism allows the operator to more easily apply negative pressure to the syringe, resulting in a 'flash' of blood when the vessel is accessed. A wheel mechanism allows for subsequent guidewire advancement through the body of the device and therefore directly into the targeted vessel. The invention can be managed by the practitioner's dominant hand while the ultrasound probe is held in the non-dominant hand to maintain visualization. The device assembly is then removed, leaving the guidewire in the lumen of the vessel of interest. Other embodiments of the proposed device include a custom needle, guidewire, and/or syringe. Additionally, it may be feasible to attach a pressure transducer to the device to permit the clinician to measure pressure levels in the vessel, further assessing placement in a venous versus an arterial vessel. The device may also be adapted for use in other procedures such as chest tube placement, which also relies on the Seldinger technique.",

    "ip_description": "MRI scans allow control and interpretation of data acquisition when producing an image. Traditional MRI data acquisition relies on a trial-and-error process of signal acquisition. Researchers propose an optimization-based strategy to improve scan quality and duration. One unique advantage of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over other types of medical imaging is the ability to control and interpret data acquisition to influence the reconstructed image. K-space is the name of the data matrix obtained directly from the magnetic resonance scanner before the processing and reconstruction of the final image through computational analysis. The sampling trajectory of MRI scanning determines the raw signal acquisition strategy and can influence imaging quality and speed. Traditional sampling trajectory relies on a trial-and-error process to heuristically determine signal acquisition, an approach that can introduce image artifacts when obtaining fast imaging. Researchers at the University of Michigan have proposed a robust optimization-based strategy for trajectory design. This sampling optimization considers non-Cartesian trajectory options which provide a clear improvement over existing, Cartesian-based approaches. The process follows the principles of machine learning, or the use of data and algorithms to facilitate increased computer accuracy when taking on complex tasks. This new software utilizes a large dataset to build an algorithm which learns optimal sampling trajectory and reconstruction parameters by defining image quality as the 'objective function'. The optimization of sampling trajectory and the reconstruction method positively influence each other, synergistically producing excellent images. This new approach builds a training and optimization framework which considers physical constraints and imperfections of magnetic resonance scanners to produce scans with higher image quality and decreased scanning times.",

Researchers generated synthetic fiber segments which align by magnetic electrospinning. Complex organisms are made up of tissues that are predominately embedded within a fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) consisting of proteins that provide mechanical structure to resident cells. Beyond its structural properties, this matrix helps to regulate cell functions such as migration, proliferation, and stem cell differentiation. Various methods have been employed to create in vitro alignment of matrix fibers in purified biopolymer hydrogels, including flow-induced alignment, uniaxial tensile deformation, and magnetic particles. Still, purified biopolymers have been limited in their ability to respond to important biophysical cues such as stiffness, fiber density, and fiber alignment. Researchers at the University of Michigan have generated synthetic, cell-adhesive fiber segments of the same length as stromal proteins through a process called electrospinning. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are purposely embedded within synthetic fiber segments to provide a means by which to align those fibers within an amorphous bulk hydrogel. The investigators were able to show that this type of fiber alignment was able to prompt invading multicellular strands to separate into disconnected single cells and multicellular clusters. The magnetic fiber strands can also be incorporated into other natural and synthetic hydrogels and aligned with inexpensive and readily accessible rare earth magnets. Given that matrix mechanics influence important cellular behaviors, studying their properties may increase knowledge about fundamental biological processes such as embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis as well as diseases such as fibrosis and neoplasia. This technology can provide a laboratory environment where stiffness, fiber density, and fiber alignment can be investigated to provide insights into those morphogenic and pathogenic processes which take place in biological systems.",

Superior to ultracentrifugation in isolating cancer-derived exosomal vesicles. Exosomes are vesicles released by cells that may contain DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids. The cellular cargo contained in exosomes are identical to analogous structures in the parent cells. These exosomes may be detected in nearly all bodily fluids by means of a liquid biopsy. The production of exosomes occurs in both healthy and diseased cells, and their contents may serve as a biomarker for illnesses such as Parkinson's disease, liver disease, and neoplasm. Some cancer cells have been shown to produce up to 10 times more exosomes than normal cells from the same lineage. Therefore, a need exists to optimize detection and characterization of exosomal vesicles (EV). Researchers have created a porous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microsystem which selectively bind EV's based upon immunoaffinity. PDMS is utilized widely in a range of industries and research settings, and it has been shown to exhibit versatile chemical and physical properties useful for biological and medical applications. While PDMS has previously been limited in biological studies because of its hydrophobic and oleophilic properties, oxidation processes can create a species that is more compatible with aqueous solutions and therefore biological samples. The inventors were able to create cubes which introduced a high surface area template while maintaining PDMS's wide range of functional properties.

New software that decreases noise levels for T2* weighted images, QSM, and fMRI. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning is a non-invasive diagnostic technology that produces three dimensional anatomical images through the excitement and subsequent detection of protons found in water located in human tissues. One of the drawbacks to the patient experience is a loud acoustic noise that can reach 130 decibels during the MRI study. That noise can cause patient apprehension, it can diminish communication between the patient and the radiation technologist, and it may negatively influence data collection, especially in a subset of studies known as functional MRIs. Companies which produce MRI scanners have created machines that are less noisy, though quieter scanning is generally limited to the acquisition of T1, or structural, images. This technology is less successful while obtaining quiet scans for T2* weighted images, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and functional MRI (fMRI) scanning. In these situations, signals are generated from multiple, simultaneous excitation pulses that create overlapping signals, or echos. Existing software can analyze these echos, though with a resulting degradation in image resolution or increased scanning time. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed software that maintains high resolution scanning while preserving low acoustic noise associated with quiet scanners produced by several machine companies. The inventors created a program that takes advantage of the use of multiple matrices during image reconstruction, successfully removing background noise and increasing signal amplitude and uniformity to yield high-quality anatomic scans. The United States saw 30 million MRI scans ordered in 2021, and the goal will be for this technology to be utilized with existing scanners to quiet acquisition of T2* weighted images, QSM, and fMRI.

May aid cancer detection and provide guidance for treatment. Exosomes are nanosized particles produced by most cells in the human body to facilitate intracellular communication. Tumor-derived exosomes are known to promote cancer cell growth, to foster the formation of metastases, and to regulate drug resistance to antineoplastic agents. The presence of novel exosomes in the blood stream can therefore potentially serve as a marker to aid the diagnosis of cancer. Within this rapidly emerging family of biomarkers for cancer detection are cancer-cell secreted nanoscale small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). The existing methodologies used to profile sEVs require complex technologies and protocols, limiting their timeliness and therefore their usefulness. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a method to rapidly isolate and detect cancer-associated exosomes through liquid biopsy of blood plasma. The process detects exosomes by using their affinity to Annexin IV and assembling layers of chiral gold nanoparticles onto a microfluidic device. This methodology improves sensitivity and timeliness of detection by an order of magnitude compared to traditional techniques. It also provides a low-cost glass or plastic-based means by which to use microfluidics to profile various extracellular vesicles. From a clinical standpoint, exosomes from lung cancer patients can be distinguished from those in healthy donors by evaluating chiroptical spectroscopic signatures of bimolecular components of exosomes enhanced by chiral plasmic nanoparticles.

Physical dimensions that make it compatible with existing instrument holding trays. An ophthalmology lens holding tray, also known simply as a lens tray or lens case, is a specialized container used to organize and store lenses and other ophthalmic instruments used during eye examinations and procedures. These trays are typically designed to keep lenses clean, accessible, and protected from damage. Lens trays usually have multiple compartments or slots to hold different types and sizes of lenses. Lens trays are typically made from durable materials such as plastic or metal to withstand frequent use and sterilization. Some lens trays feature removable inserts or dividers, allowing for customization of the layout to accommodate various lens sizes and shapes. This flexibility enables ophthalmologists to organize their trays according to their specific needs and preferences. Since ophthalmic instruments require strict hygiene and sterilization protocols to prevent infection, lens trays are designed to be compatible with standard sterilization methods such as autoclaving or chemical disinfection. Existing trays may suffer from limited capacity, inflexible layout, difficult in cleaning, and compatibility issues. So, the need exists for an improved lens holding tray design. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a plastic insert which can hold several types of devices used for examination or treatment of eye diseases.

Patients who require medical intervention to maintain a patent airway or support breathing are intubated with an endotracheal tube (ETT). ETTs require precise placement in the trachea. Malpositioned endotracheal tubes (ETTs) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations such as critically ill infants and young children, where a 5-10 mm malpositioned ETT can have dire consequences. The rate of malpositioned ETTs in neonates is as high as 29-50%. Unplanned pediatric extubations have an associated increase in hospital costs and an increase of 6.5 days/case length of stay. The current gold standard for confirming appropriate ETT position in intubated patients is the chest x-ray (CXR). CXRs are obtained following each intubation to determine adequate initial ETT position, and following excessive patient movement or manipulation when there is a risk for ETT displacement or extubation. CXRs are not available bedside, expose the patient to increasing levels of radiation, and can be confounded by other medical equipment supporting patient care. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a cuffed, ultrasound-detectable ETT (USD ETT) comparable to currently used cuffed ETTs. The subtle, yet impactful, design change in the USD ETT is a slight divot in the middle of the cuff. This divot allows the clinician to accurately image the ETT with a portable ultrasound unit at the bedside.

Pulse sequences for spiral trajectory measurement and cardiac MRF T1, T2, and M0 mapping (native and post-contrast). Image reconstruction software for cardiac MRF, including low-rank and Deep Image Prior methods. Software for calculation of synthetic multi-contrast LGE images. Quantitative MRI is a powerful tool for assessing cardiac health. Two clinically measured tissue properties are T1 and T2, which can be used for early detection and monitoring of fibrosis, inflammation, and edema, among other conditions. Cardiac magnetic resonance fingerprinting (cMRF) is one technique for simultaneous T1-T2 mapping, which uses a time-varying sequence, an undersampled spiral k-space trajectory, and pattern matching with a dictionary of simulated signals to estimate quantitative maps. Although the cMRF acquisition is efficient, with data collected during one breathhold, the reconstruction time is long and prohibits real-time display of the maps. One major hurdle is that the subject's cardiac rhythm determines the pulse sequence timings because the scan is electrocardiogram (ECG) triggered. As a result, a new dictionary must be simulated after every acquisition that appropriately models the scan timings to obtain accurate quantitative maps. A typical cMRF reconstruction uses a dictionary with over 20,000 T1-T2 entries and requires 5 minutes to calculate from a Bloch equation simulation (including corrections for slice profile and preparation pulse efficiency). In this work, University of Michigan researchers have developed an efficient cardiac MRF reconstruction pipeline for simultaneous T1, T2, and M0 mapping.

The antibodies display superior affinity properties against alpha-beta fibrils and lower levels of non-specific interactions compared to existing antibodies, providing the potential to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of this category of illnesses. This affinity maturation process could furthermore be applied to the development of antibodies with even more specificity to alpha-beta fibrils, or alternatively it could be used to evolve the conformational specificity of existing antibodies against diverse types of amyloidogenic aggregates. Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are expected to become more prevalent as life expectancy increases due to significant advances in treating other human disorders such as cancer and heart disease. These neurodegenerative diseases are linked to the formation of toxic prefibrillar oligomers and amyloid fibrils in the brain. Natural antibodies specific to amyloid-forming proteins may detect, disrupt, and reverse toxic protein aggregation in these illnesses. While there is interest in generating exogenous antibodies to treat Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, the production of antibodies to these antigens is difficult because amyloid is relatively insoluble, heterogenous in size and conformation, hydrophobic, and multivalent. Also, the use of immunization to generate such antibodies is limited due to variable presentation of antigens to the immune system. So, a need exists for higher quality antibodies directed at the protein aggregates associated with both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.",

    "ip_description": "Minimally invasive tool to minimize the need for speculum exams. Consists of a probe fitted with a sensor, camera, light source, and tissue collection brush. Improved patient comfort and compliance with routine gynecological/proctological screening. Many individuals experience fear, embarrassment, or anxiety associated with gynecological exams, which can lead them to avoid or delay appointments. Previous negative experiences during gynecological exams, such as pain, discomfort, or feeling disrespected by healthcare providers, may deter individuals from seeking future screenings. Gynecological exams, such as cervical cancer screening, require a patient to lay on her back with her legs up in stirrups, and a mechanical speculum is used by practitioners to stretch the vagina for proper visualization and specimen collection. By addressing the underlying reasons for noncompliance and implementing strategies to overcome barriers, healthcare providers and organizations can help improve gynecological healthcare utilization and ultimately promote better reproductive health outcomes for individuals. There remains a need for a less invasive method to complete these types of routine clinical exams. Researchers have created a device that consists of a slender probe fitted with a sensor, camera, light source, and tissue collection brush, which can be inserted vaginally or rectally for tissue examination and specimen collection. The design of this tool allows it to be used when the patient is in a more comfortable position, such as laying on their side with knees together. Not only is the approach less invasive than a gynecologic speculum examination, it can easily be used for proctological evaluation. The device also allows practitioners to distance themselves from the area being examined, increasing patient comfort and diminishing provider risk of coming into direct contact with bodily fluids. The use of such a tool will lead to improved patient comfort without compromising care, which in turn may encourage more people to comply with routine preventative screenings.",

State of art in supervised learning, especially deep learning, has dramatically improved over the past decades. Many techniques are widely used as effective tools aiding human tasks, e.g., face recognition, object detection, natural language processing. However, despite effectiveness, deep learning techniques have all been demonstrated vulnerable to imperceptibly examples intentionally designed by evasion attack (i.e., adversarial attack). The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNN) restricts its application scenarios and motivates researchers to develop various defense techniques. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed Robust Adversarial Immune-Inspired Learning System (RAILS), a new adversarial defense framework that is inspired by the immune system's powerful defense ability. The researchers employ an adaptive immune system emulation, which emulates the immune system's defense mechanisms in order to robustify deep learning architectures and harden Deep k-Nearest (DkNN) architectures against evasion attacks. The life-long learning mechanism allows RAILS to evolve and defend against diverse attacks. When applied to adversarial image classification, the performance of the RAILS implementation delivers an additional 5.62% improvement in robustness without appreciable loss of accuracy as compared to applying DkNN alone.",

Enables simultaneous histologic evaluation of lesions in vivo. Gastrointestinal cancers are the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Conventional endoscopy is used to detect mucous, lesions, ulceration masses and polyps. Endoscopic procedures involve inserting a flexible tube with a light and an endoscope into the digestive tract, and they provide a direct visualization of the mucosa, allowing for the identification of abnormal growths, ulcers, and tumors. The diagnostic value of conventional endoscopy is limited, especially when evaluating lesions that are flat and visually indistinct. As such, improvements in existing endoscopic technologies could improve disease detection and eradication. Researchers have created a small flexible endoscope that uses a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) scanner and which can be multiplexed with fluorescently labeled peptides to detect changes in mucosal tissues. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), which uses a laser rather than white light as a light source, allows for the mucosa to be examined with a small microscope placed on top of the endoscope, enabling simultaneous in vivo histologic diagnosis of lesions or even optical biopsy. This novel approach provides improved visualization of lesions that are flat, small, or which present in a patchy distribution. The technique may be used to aid endoscopic evaluation of lesions in hollow organs such as the esophagus, stomach, and colon. This imaging system can be contained on a portable cart and can be used for 'point-of-care' diagnostics in patients who require 'test and treat' care. Because the diagnosis is provided instantaneously, patients receive immediate feedback on the pathology found. By only sampling the regions of tissue most likely to harbor disease, the number of biopsies taken may be minimized to reduce overdiagnosis.",

    "ip_description": "Miniature imaging instrument for endoscopy with fluorescent confocal capability and an additional 3D axis side view. Endoscopy is a commonly used technique through which a doctor can use a scope to look inside the body and take detailed pictures of tissues. An advancement on this technique is fluorescence confocal microscopy where histology-like images can be obtained in real time to produce an optical biopsy which can be used for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Many of these endomicroscopes utilize small and flexible fiber bundles, and which therefore permit use in smaller spaces such as the biliary tree. Still, drawbacks to this approach include front-only optics as well as visualization that is limited to the horizontal plane. As such, a need exists for improved endoscopic equipment to optimize its usefulness. Researchers have created a novel miniature imaging instrument to alleviate some of the current limitations of fluorescence endomicroscopy. This confocal endomicroscope utilizes a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) mirror and compact lens for optical sectioning. This system allows for a 3-axis side view as well as the standard front view seen in most confocal endomicroscopes. From the images obtained by this device, three-dimensional structures can be recreated to provide a better understanding of the tissues and the areas being visualized. In addition to visualizing the horizontal plane, this device can also visualize the oblique plane. Furthermore, in vivo samples of mouse adenomas have been scoped with this device at higher resolution than with existing fiber bundle based endomicroscopes. This device is miniature and fits inside the standard biopsy channel of a medical endoscope. The configuration of this innovation also allows for scaling to even smaller sizes, if necessary, to fit in smaller places such as the biliary tree. This technology has the potential to allow for higher quality optical biopsies to be taken in real-time while documenting the diagnosis and treatment response of diseases.",

    "ip_description": "Small molecule therapy for disease-modifying treatment of peripheral neuropathy. Provides the first potential disease-modifying treatment for peripheral neuropathy. May treat diabetes-, chemotherapy-, and trauma-induced peripheral neuropathies. Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a disorder affecting peripheral nerves, impacting about 10% of the global population. PNs are frequently linked to conditions such as diabetes, HIV, and alcoholism, and can also result from physical trauma, hormonal imbalances, and chemotherapy, among others. Currently, treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms like pain through partially effective palliative methods, supplemented by physical therapy and lifestyle adjustments. However, existing treatments do not address the underlying disease mechanisms or prevent sensory loss. The absence of disease-modifying treatments necessitates the development of novel therapeutic approaches to halt or reverse the progression of PNs, a pervasive and debilitating condition. Researchers have discovered a non-peptidyl small molecule, XIB4035, that acts as a disease-modifying therapy. XIB4035 preserves the integrity of peripheral nerves and enhances neuronal survival across various mouse models, including transgenic, diabetic, and chemotherapy-induced models of PN. It functions as a positive modulator of the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase Ret, crucial for nervous system development and maintenance. Additionally, a new family of compounds with improved properties has been identified, showing promising results in cell-based assays and low toxicity profiles. The ultimate goal is to develop a safe, effective drug-like molecule that can be clinically tested to either prevent or reverse peripheral neuropathies. Real-world applications include treating neuropathies associated with diabetes, chemotherapy, and physical trauma, addressing a significant unmet medical need.",

    "ip_description": "Human reporter cell line with a non-invasive imaging assay to measure autophagic flux in living cells. Optimized and validated for high-throughput screening of compound libraries. Therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disorders, heart disease, and liver disease. Autophagy is the process by which healthy cells safely degrade unwanted proteins. Misregulation of autophagy has been linked to neurodegenerative conditions, cancer, infectious diseases, and cardiac disorders. Autophagy has been demonstrated to be broadly neuroprotective in two relatively common neurodegenerative diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Stimulating autophagy extends neuronal survival and ameliorates symptoms of disease in cellular and animal models of ALS and FTD, making this pathway a highly promising therapeutic target for those and other neurodegenerative disorders involving protein misfolding and accumulation. Development of effective autophagy modulating drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS has been hampered by fundamental deficiencies in available methods for measuring autophagic activity, or flux, so a need exists for a non-invasive imaging assay to mitigate this limitation. Researchers have created a photoconvertible protein named Dendra2 that can be introduced into the endogenous MAP1LC3B locus of human cell lines via CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, enabling accurate and sensitive determinations of autophagy activity via optical pulse labeling. High-content screening of 6,000 tool compounds and FDA-approved drugs using this assay showed that many reported autophagy stimulators either fail to enhance autophagy, or conversely inhibit autophagy flux, reaffirming the importance of measuring pathway dynamics rather than the steady state abundance of intermediates. Within an expanded library of 24,000 compounds sampling a wide diversity of chemical space, novel active compounds can be identified with profound effects on autophagy, validated by comparison with alternative methods. Because protein misfolding and accumulation are conserved characteristics found in nearly all neurodegenerative disorders as well as age-related conditions such as heart disease and liver disease, the compounds identified by this assay may have extensive and wide-ranging therapeutic potential.",

    "ip_description": "A dendritic cell (DC) vaccine that sensitizes T cells to cancer stem cells (CSCs). Confers preferential immunogenicity and cytotoxicity to cancer stem cells in vitro. Elicits superior in vivo immunity when compared to other non-CSC-DC vaccines. Despite advances in the understanding of common solid malignancies, certain tumors are still a problem to treat with conventional modalities. Locally advanced cancers are at high risk for relapse and metastasis. The persistence of cancer stem cells (CSC) that are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation is one possible reason for this risk of relapse and metastasis. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) has been found to be a cancer stem cell marker in several cancers. Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines directed toward ALDH have shown promise in targeting CSC, though the major limitation to the clinical use of the CSC-DC vaccine is the requirement for certain number of patient tumor tissues to isolate the ALDH high CSCs to prepare the cell lysate to generate the CSC-DC vaccine. Thus, a need exists to identify CSC associated peptide antigens that can be used for peptide DC vaccination. Researchers have successfully sorted ALDH high CSCs in immunocompetent murine models to prepare a dendritic cell vaccine which demonstrates excellent anti-tumor immunity. The peptides that have been generated show high binding affinity to T cell receptors when tested both in vitro and in vivo. The ALDH high CSC lysate dendritic cell vaccine (CSC-DC) demonstrates superior activity when compared to traditional ALDH low non-CSC-DC vaccinations. The vaccine exhibits efficacy in conjunction with other modalities such as surgery and radiotherapy in the treatment of established tumors. Investigators also report that CSC-DC vaccination is more efficacious in combination with check-point blockade.",

    "ip_description": "Improved intestinal organoids containing vascular endothelial cells. Better modeling of the in vivo intestine. Co-culture technique for vascularization while growing organoid. Recent advances in our understanding of development have led to the ability to grow organoids in culture. Growing organoids in culture involves the creation of three-dimensional structures derived from stem cells or tissue samples that mimic the structure and function of specific organs. This technique has revolutionized biomedical research, providing scientists with a more physiologically relevant model for studying human development, disease mechanisms, drug responses, and potential therapies. This has been done for several organ systems including the intestines. Although these organoids recapitulate much of their in vivo counterparts, it remains difficult to fully model organs outside the body. Intestinal organoid cultures currently lack several components including immune cells, enteric neurons, the microbiome, and sufficient vasculature to mimic real life phenomena. Researchers have created a method to enhance co-differentiation and maintenance of an endothelial cell population cultured along with human intestinal organoids. These co-cultured endothelial cells display markers found in intestinal endothelial cells existing in vivo. This technology allows for co-differentiation of intestinal vascular endothelial cells in a human intestinal organoid culture. Although organoid culture has been previously established, those previously cultured tissues did not possess all of the components found in the body. This system therefore facilitates better replication of the in vivo intestine in an in vitro system. These organoids can be used to more accurately study intestinal development and also provide a model system for therapeutic development.",

    "ip_description": "A novel therapeutic agent capable of binding the NS1 domain of flavivirus. A biologic therapeutic for treating dengue, Zika, and West Nile diseases. Especially useful in diminishing symptoms of severe flavivirus infections. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are responsible for several types of infections including dengue, Zika, and West Nile diseases. Up to 100 million dengue virus (DENV) cases occur worldwide each year, and the most severe form of the disease can cause vascular leak as a result of endothelial dysfunction. The trigger for this 'cytokine storm' is uncontrolled viral replication and activation of target immune cells as mediated by the DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1). NS1 is a glycoprotein essential for flavivirus viability, and it correlates with disease severity and severe dengue pathogenesis. Extracellular NS1 acts as a virulence factor that inhibits complement, activates platelets and immune cells, and decreases the ability of endothelial cells to maintain a fluid equilibrium. There are currently no approved therapeutics for these flavivirus diseases, and successful vaccines remain elusive. A need therefore exists for a broadly reactive flavivirus treatment or vaccine that targets NS1. Researchers have discovered a Flavivirus therapeutic targeting the NS1 domain of the virus to serve as a potential target against pathogens causing dengue, Zika, and the West Nile Virus. The researchers have demonstrated that the antibody is protective against lethal dengue virus infection in a mouse model. This novel biotherapeutic agent is derived from a monoclonal antibody (2B7) that attaches to NS1 and blocks it from binding with cell surfaces and triggering the endothelial dysfunction associated with the most severe forms of flavivirus diseases. The therapeutic agent can even be fused with another protein that breaks down or clears proteins such as NS1 from the serum, removing the potentially dangerous mediator from the circulation. The beneficial protein does not cause antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), a phenomenon associated with the unintentional enhancement of viral entry and replication in cells. The positive clinical effects should be able to help treat infections caused by any one of the flavivirus family of pathogens.",

Highly effective for research of mammalian cells, both in cell lines and in vivo. CRISPR genome editing is a widely used tool for gene editing in many organisms including mammals. Traditional CRISPR/Cas9 systems function by targeting a single site on a gene, creating a break, and imperfectly repairing the break, resulting in a missense mutation. Researchers are continuing to find ways to utilize CRISPR to create more targeted and more detrimental mutations. One such system is Type I CRISPR, which causes heterogenous deletions in very large DNA segments. Given the physical size of many CRISPR systems, a need exists for a more space-saving device. Researchers have identified a novel Type I CRISPR system from a bacterium source which is more streamlined and compact than currently available tools. The smaller size makes this a more feasible tool for viral-based delivery to mammalian genomes. Additionally, this system exhibits very high genome editing activity in various human cell lines. This CRISPR system is also easier to purify and prepare than other systems. Collectively, these qualities make this an attractive tool for genome editing of human cells.",

High reaction selectivity for versatile polysaccharide designs. Glycosylation, or the forming of glycosidic bonds between sugar molecules to produce oligo and polysaccharides, is one of the basic biological enzymatic reactions. Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification process in which a carbohydrate, specifically a glycan, is covalently attached to a protein, lipid, or another organic molecule. This process is essential for the structure, stability, and function of many biological molecules. Poly and oligosaccharides can also be synthesized in the laboratory setting, however existing methods frequently result in low selectivity and reaction efficiency, making it suboptimal for commercial purposes. So, a need exists for a better means to synthesize oligosaccharides. This novel method for catalytic glycosylation enables fast, high yield and scalable synthesis of a wide range of oligosaccharides. By utilizing catalytic coupling of glycosyl fluorides and silyl ethers to produce glycosidic bonds, this method enables formation of predetermined complex oligosaccharides, both those occurring naturally as well as novel synthetic designs. Not only can the process be tailored to a specific oligosaccharide design, it is scalable and therefore amenable to commercial automated instrumentation. This technology provides a viable tool for a wide range of pharmaceutical and research applications as well as for rapidly growing markets in synthetic biology. Thus, these oligosaccharides can be synthesized for carbohydrate-based therapeutics, compound libraries for drug screening, to act as components of vaccines.",

Reduced human error with minimal training requirements for assessment of hip arthroplasty. Dislocation is one of the most important complications after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and occurs in 1-5% of THA patients, some of which will require revision surgery. Even if treated non-operatively, the patients who sustain postoperative dislocations have lower satisfaction rates and worse functional outcomes. Implant alignment is the most important factor that causes dislocation and can be modified by orthopedic surgeons. In order to improve the alignment of the implants, the surgeons can use either insertion guides (conventional method) or computer-assisted navigation systems. The surgeons will conduct a stability test in the operation room regardless of the method used for the implantation. Currently, this stability test is performed manually without any digital guidance. Surgeons generally have to place their finger around the trial femoral head to see if it dislocates during the test or not. This increases the possibility of contamination and, as a result, infection and is very inaccurate. Researchers have designed a digital stability test device that can be used with any of the currently available implants used for total hip arthroplasty. The innovators describe a method that more accurately describes the hip-spine relationship and which requires minimal training to implement. This approach reduces human error that is associated with existing approaches for implant assessment. The advantages to the digital stability test include a decrease in post-surgical infection rates and a more cost-effective test than other navigation systems for computer-assisted surgery.

Applies to single-cell analysis, drug screening, genomics, and cell interaction studies. Droplet-based microfluidics assays are pivotal in biological research, offering single-cell resolution in applications like antibody and enzyme screening, drug discovery, genomics, transcriptomics, and cell-cell interaction analysis. Traditionally, these assays involve encapsulating cells or particles in droplets, a stochastic process that frequently results in droplets either remaining empty or containing multiple cells. This inefficiency reduces screening throughput and escalates reagent costs. Challenges amplify when assays demand the co-encapsulation of two distinct particle types into single droplets. The conventional co-flowing scheme to pair different particles faces low efficiency and produces numerous negative outcomes, including droplets with single or same-type particles, which compromises sample integrity and downstream analyses. Thus, a need exists for improving pairing efficiency to optimize microfluidic assays. Researchers have created a droplet merging device which addresses the inefficiencies in conventional microfluidic assays by employing specially-designed microwell arrays that can trap and merge droplets of different sizes. This method creates isolated aqueous compartments that contain the paired droplets' mixed contents, significantly enhancing pairing efficiency. This design increases throughput and reduces reagent costs by minimizing empty and incorrectly paired droplets. Technical advances include the precise trapping and merging capability, resulting in more accurate single-cell analyses and higher assay efficiency. Applications encompass enhanced single-cell analysis, more efficient drug screening, improved genomics and transcriptomics studies, and precise cell-cell interaction investigations, thus driving advancements in biological research and therapeutic development.",

Traditional ultrasound systems, however, are often bulky, expensive, and require skilled operators to capture accurate images. These limitations have spurred interest in developing more accessible and user-friendly alternatives. Historically, wearable sensors have emerged as a promising solution, but many still rely on user interaction or suffer from high costs and complexity, which impedes widespread adoption.

Enhanced cancer biomarker detection, early disease diagnostics, and therapeutic management. Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) have emerged as a significant cancer biomarker, providing pivotal information for early disease diagnostics and therapeutic management. Historically, the standard methods for CTC isolation have involved drawing small volumes of blood from patients and processing these samples for analysis. Although these approaches have yielded valuable insights, they also come with notable shortcomings, such as limited blood volumes that may not accurately capture the full heterogeneity of tumor cells. Additionally, the need for repetitive blood draws can be a burden to patients. These limitations highlight a need for improved methods that can more comprehensively collect and analyze CTCs, thereby more accurately reflecting the diverse nature of cancer cells and enhancing the potential for early detection and personalized therapeutic interventions. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed an in vivo CTC isolation system designed to be worn by living vertebrates, enabling continuous collection of CTCs directly from the peripheral vein. This system significantly diverges from traditional blood-draw methods by allowing for the retransfusion of the remaining blood products after CTC sampling and enrichment. Consequently, this advancement allows for the screening of larger blood volumes without unduly burdening the patient. Technically, this system improves the comprehensiveness and convenience of CTC isolation, offering a more accurate reflection of tumor cell heterogeneity.

The National Institutes of Health estimates that 50 to 70 million people in the United States suffer from chronic sleep disorders and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Sleep disorders are associated with a number of serious health risks, including heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Due to a lack of awareness as well as costly and unpleasant testing procedures, the majority of sleep problems remain undiagnosed and untreated. An inexpensive way to diagnose sleep disorder is to monitor the salivary levels of melatonin, a naturally occurring hormone whose levels rise prior to sleep onset. Given difficulties measuring these melatonin levels in a simple and inexpensive manner, a need exists for improved mechanisms to accomplish this feat. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a device that enables melatonin monitoring, called the Saliva Micro-Array Retainer (SmR) device. The invention is comprised of a MEMS array (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) of micro-reservoirs. These reservoirs are three dimensionally (3D) printed, custom-made, and resemble a teeth-whitening retainer.

Ultrasound imagers use high-frequency sound waves to view soft tissues, such as blood vessels, muscles, and internal organs, in real time. Ultrasound imagers are able to measure tissue movement or displacement and blood flow and are also used to guide the introduction of devices, tubes, and catheters, among others. Conventional ultrasound imagers use a probe with transducer array that is placed against the skin and is connected to a hand-carried (or table mounted) scanner device for signal processing. Most current probe-based ultrasound systems are expensive devices that scan an ultrasound beam over an area of interest. The transducer arrays are wire-coupled to an ultrasound imaging station that includes a display, input keyboard, and processing machine, which is typically housed on a moveable frame (cart based), carry case (hand carried), or desktop machine. Recently, handheld (as opposed to hand carried) diagnostic ultrasound imaging devices have been proposed. Such devices would be pocket-sized and incorporate a miniature display and signal processing system that is connected to an ultrasound probe through a wired connection. The devices are small, but still cumbersome in that the operator (e.g., physician, pharmacist, or other health care provider) holds and scans the probe with one hand and holds the display/processing unit in the other hand. This can make it difficult to perform certain procedures that require the use of another hand. Furthermore, these devices are expensive, in large part because all the image processing is performed on the portable device, which requires expensive signal processing circuitry and the associated programming. In contrast, this technology describes a handheld ultrasound device where the image processing is performed remotely by another system, which decreases the cost and size of the device and allows the operator to use the other hand for different tasks.",

Current technology can provide a detailed structural view of the eye, but is limited in providing functional information, such as what types of cells or chemicals are inside the eye. The disclosed technology is an imaging technique that not only offers detailed structural images of tumors in the eye, but also differentiates between healthy and cancerous tissue via a safe, non-invasive approach. Since the disclosed technology uses ultrasound equipment, it has the potential to be drastically less expensive and more compact than current functional imaging approaches. Researchers have discovered an approach that offers several advantages over competing technologies for cancer detection within the eye, one of which is that it is non-invasive, compared to methods that involve a biopsy. Another is that the disclosed technology uses ultrasounds, by taking advantage of the photoacoustic effect, which offers the ability to image deep in the tissue with the potential to be drastically less expensive than imaging techniques that involve radiation, such as Computerized Tomography using X-rays, or super powerful magnets, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Compared to traditional ultrasound imaging, the disclosed technology is able to provide chemical functional information, which is crucial for cancer diagnosis, in addition to anatomical information. The disclosed technology also evaluates greater tissue depths than Optical Coherence Tomography.",

    "ip_description": "A novel method that fuses a common epitope to any selected membrane protein. Expands the ability of existing technologies to define membrane protein structure. Provides access to smaller and less rigid proteins for structural analysis. Determining the structure of a protein is an integral step in the development of therapeutics for specific diseases. While membrane proteins may play a part in common illnesses such as heart disease, Alzheimer's dementia, and cystic fibrosis, relatively few of the known membrane proteins in human cells have a structure that has been fully elucidated. One of the obstacles to structural identification of membrane proteins is the requirement for advanced techniques to successfully prepare the samples. One strategy to increase the suitability of these proteins for structural study involves selection of antibodies that bind to them, though the process for identifying these antibodies has been proven to be slow and prohibitively expensive. As such, a need exists for improved methods to define membrane protein structure. Researchers at the University of Michigan have invented a method that creates the ability for an epitope to be fused to a selected membrane protein, permitting the same human antibody fragments to be used in structural studies of any membrane protein-epitope fusion. The innovation involves the fusion of an epitope derived from an HIV protein's membrane proximal external region (MPER) with the protein of interest. This epitope is then recognized and bound by human-derived antibody fragments, improving the yield of the existing cryogenic electronic microscopy (cryo-EM) method for defining protein structure. The researchers have also engineered smaller, single-chain antibody fragments which can be expressed in Escherichia coli and therefore recovered inexpensively. Overall, this technique allows for the capture of smaller as well as less rigid membrane proteins, which is a marked improvement when compared to existing capabilities.",

    "ip_description": "Uniform brain organoids from human-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. Rosette models having consistent morphology with single, centrally located lumen. A three-dimensional culture tool for predictive toxicology and drug discovery. The first four weeks of human fetal development include the formation of a neural tube that subsequently develops into the brain and spinal cord. During embryogenesis, clusters of cells in what are known as 'neural rosettes' form in radial arrangements of columnar cells along the length of the neural tube. Rosettes express proteins that influence neighboring cells to differentiate into neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Neural networks derived from stem cells, however, produce multiple organizing centers resulting in non-reproducible, disorganized neural circuits. Identifying technical means to address this problem would aid researchers in developing scalable and reproducible neural networks with applications in drug development and precision medicine. While the development of cultured neural networks from stem cells is a promising method for scientists to develop and test neural drugs in vitro, the ability to develop standardized research systems remains a challenge. As such, a need exists for new methods to reproducibly create these models. Researchers at the University of Michigan have created a technology which provides a technique to reproducibly produce human brain organoids from pluripotent stem cells. The invention involves treating stem cells with small molecules to give rise to developmentally timed neural networks. The scientists developed a technique that produces human, self-organizing single-rosette brain organoids (SOSRS) that generate excitatory cortical-like neurons. The SOSRS have a consistent diameter and can be grown relatively quickly, producing neurons from multiple cortical layers. This culture system enables researchers to study development of neural structures as well as the effects of drugs on the neurons. The model can also be modified to develop inhibitory neurons which have been shown to be present in diseases such as autism and schizophrenia. As such, this invention shows a potential method for evaluating novel therapeutic agents for a variety of common and debilitating diseases.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Microparticles block neutrophil accumulation in the lungs of patients with acute lung injury or ARDS. The vascular-targeted particles achieve therapeutic benefit through physical interactions. Rapid onset of action that is applicable to patients with active ALI/ARDS. Acute Lung Injury (ALI) is a progressive inflammatory disease characterized by the disruption of the lung endothelial and epithelial barriers causing airspace fluid accumulation, impaired gas exchange, and reduced lung function. In its most severe form, ALI leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can cause death in more than half of affected patients during their hospitalization or in the six months following discharge. The primary treatment for ALI/ARDS is to try to maintain oxygenation through mechanical ventilation or by the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Beyond supportive measures, pharmaceutical interventions for ALI/ARDS are limited. The inflammatory cascade that triggers ALI/ARDS leads to expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules (LAMS) which facilitate the rapid migration of circulating blood neutrophils. These neutrophils both destroy the alveolar-capillary barrier creating lung edema and accumulate in lung tissues to promote further damage to normal cells. The concentration of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid correlates with ARDS severity, so a need exists to foster research into methods for reducing the deleterious effects of neutrophils in this clinical setting. Researchers propose a novel approach that designs vascular-targeted nano- and micro-particles which can passively yet rapidly block neutrophil accumulation in inflamed lung tissues during acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The treatment has a rapid onset of action and can be effective even after the onset of ALI/ARDS. This invention does not require an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), rather it builds upon published works which demonstrate that vascular-targeted particles (VTPs) in human blood interact with, and reduce vascular wall adhesion of, neutrophils to a monolayer of activated endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro. These findings have been confirmed in a mouse model, with a greater than 90% drop in neutrophils recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in treated versus untreated mice. It is therefore the VTPs themselves that achieve therapeutic benefit solely through physical interactions rather than serving as carriers for a pharmaceutical agent. Neutrophil adhesion is prevented by both physical coverage of the EC surface as well as free stream particle-cell interactions. The VTPS are formed from a biodegradable, biocompatible PolyAspirin (PA) polymer which undergoes degradation to form salicylic acid. PA VTPs targeted to inflammation can block neutrophil migration into the lung airway in ALI, while also locally releasing salicylic acid, an anti-inflammatory agent, to further treat the lung injury. The discovery also holds hope for improving outcomes of other inflammatory conditions associated with neutrophil activation, such as sepsis.",

    "ip_description": "A novel treatment for photoreceptor diseases through activation of PKM2. Small molecule activator ML-265 that induces changes in photoreceptor cells. A means to address illnesses that currently lack therapy options. Photoreceptor cells in the retina including rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells are the neuroendocrine cells which sense light and influence circadian rhythm. Photoreceptor (PR) dysfunction or death is the cause of vision loss or blindness in nearly 18 million people in the United States. Common illnesses which adversely affect PR and that therefore cause vision loss include retinal detachment, retinal dystrophies, and age-related macular degeneration. The poor visual function and blindness patients experience results in life-long vision services, loss of productivity for patients and caregivers, and a reduced quality of life. Currently, no successful treatment options exist to prevent photoreceptor death in retinal diseases. So, there is an urgent need exists to discover neuroprotective modalities to improve photoreceptor survival. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a novel treatment for photoreceptor diseases that targets Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Isoform 2 (PKM2). In contrast to terminally differentiated neurons, PR neurons perform aerobic glycolysis and maintain PKM2 expression. The inventors have determined that a small molecule activator of PKM2 named ML-265 can be activated to boost PR survival under stress. ML-265 is a small molecular activator that promotes PKM2 to take a tetrameric form that displays a high catalytic activity and that is associated with ATP synthesis, catabolic metabolism, and induction of metabolic changes in photoreceptors. The researchers report that metabolic programming via genetic and pharmacologic PKM2 activation reduces PR cell death and increases cell viability in vitro and in an in vivo rat model. The inventors have formulated additional PKM2 activator compounds which may complement and augment the positive effects of ML-265. The clinical use of these compounds may therefore delay or prevent PR death and improve outcomes for patients with retinal disease. Figure 1: Photoreceptor cells treated with ML-265 in vitro display decreased caspase activation, a marker of cell death, in response to FasL treatment. FasL produces caspase activation similar to that observed in retinal detachment. A correlating increase in cell viability was observed with ML-265 treatment. Figure 2: Similar to in vitro experiments, treatment with ML-265 showed reduced caspase activity after retinal detachment in rats.",

    "ip_description": "A novel class of compounds that disrupt oxidative phosphorylation within mitochondria. Selective inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Provides a method to treat cancer and multiple other mitochondrial disorders. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is an important process that occurs within the mitochondria of cells. This cascade consists of over 90 proteins which work together to link the tai-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Tumor cells rely on this process similarly to normal cells do for bioenergetics and biomass production. Inhibitors of OXPHOS currently exist and are used in the treatment of cancer as well as other mitochondria functional disorders including inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease. However, current therapeutics often fall short of effectively treating these ailments, so a need exists for improved methods to inhibit OXPHOS. Researchers have created a technology that permits the preparation and use of several mitochondrial compounds which inhibit OXPHOS. These agents cause selective inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is one of the key protein complexes involved in the process of oxidative phosphorylation within mitochondria. Complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, is responsible for the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) in the electron transport chain. These targets represent a new class of compounds which can be used for the treatment of several cancers or disorders of mitochondrial function including brain cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma among others. These compounds can be used in combination with existing therapeutics or on their own to treat cancer and other mitochondrial disorders.",

Specifically, this agent interacts differently with CYP21A2, which is the target thought to be the cause of increased hypertension and additional side effects seen with abiraterone treatment. This abiraterone analog contains a B-ring substitution which makes it more selective for treating prostate cancer. Inhibition studies reveal that this new analog has an 80-fold increase in selective targeting of CYP17A1 for inhibition compared to CYP21A2, creating a candidate agent with greater potency and fewer side effects. The widened therapeutic window created by this analog may also be used for treatment of other neoplasms that are influenced by concentrations of androgens, such as breast cancer. Prostate cancer remains the second most lethal cancer in U.S. males. Prostate cancer cells are often dependent on androgens, such as testosterone, for their growth and proliferation. Androgens bind to and activate androgen receptors on prostate cancer cells, stimulating their growth. Therefore, therapies that target androgen signaling pathways, such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or medications like abiraterone, which inhibit androgen production, can be effective in treating prostate cancer by depriving the cancer cells of the hormones they need to grow. Abiraterone works by inhibiting the enzyme CYP17A1, which is involved in the production of androgens. However, the use of this therapeutic risks causing side effects including hypertension, hypokalemia, and edema. As such, a need exists for an improved form of abiraterone for treatment of prostate cancer patients.",

Anticlotting therapy for patients with DVT, sepsis, trauma, and cancer. Polyphosphate (polyP) is a linear polymer of inorganic orthophosphates that is widespread in biology. Interest in the role of polyP as a procoagulant molecule in humans has grown since it has been shown to be important in the processes of deep venous thrombosis, sepsis, trauma, and cancer. Additionally, beyond its biological relevance, polyP may also be detected in sewage and wastewater where it accumulates due to the activities of microorganisms. In this arena, polyP is useful in removing excess phosphate from the wastewater. However, progress in studying polyP has been hampered by a dearth of methods and tools for manipulating and analyzing its properties. There is not an easy method to determine levels of polyP in the blood, limiting scientific understanding of the ways that it may play a part in the illnesses it influences. Similarly, there is currently no easy method for quantification of polyP for quantification from environmental samples. A need exists for a means to better study polyP. Researchers have discovered a technology that addresses the need for an assay to evaluate polyP levels both in biologic and environmental samples. The invention involves an assay for quantifying inorganic phosphate in plasma by measuring the concentration-dependent shortening of clot times in plasma that has been spiked with the anticoagulant protein, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). This test is highly sensitive to the presence of polyP of the lengths secreted by activated human platelets. Since it is a clotting assay, it can be performed using standard coagulometers that are already in wide use in clinical laboratories. The ability to quantify polyP may lead to more targeted anticoagulation therapies, and a wide variety of modifications could be useful for studies such as western blots and flow cytometry. Further research can also optimize the study of polyP in environmental settings.",

Researchers at the University of Michigan have invented a transgenic mouse model for the study of autoimmune diseases. The model describes for the first time the role of a transcription factor named VGLL3 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. VGLL3 is enriched in the skin of females when compared to males, and its overexpression in mice leads to an autoimmune phenotype similar to lupus. This novel technology consists of a transgenic mouse model that permits upregulation of VGLL3 in the skin which produces a lupus-like skin rash in affected mice when compared to wild type animals. These visible and measurable skin abnormalities provide an easy means by which medical interventions can be screened and assessed for efficacy.

MYC is involved in many cancers, and its expression is elevated or deregulated in up to 70% of human cancers.

Structures are more characteristic to human embryology compared to existing 2D systems. One of the first steps of human development is the implantation of embryonic tissue into the placenta. Implantation occurs via a process called amniogenesis, whereby an amniotic cavity is formed from an epiblast, the pluripotent cell lineage which forms the definitive germ layers which guide development. As such, amniogenesis is the first of several steps following which a cascade of events leads to the formation of a viable fetus. The amniogenesis process remains relatively poorly understood due to the difficulty in studying human embryos.

A fast target binding, low cost, reduced toxicity peptide compared to existing options. Diagnostic imaging peptide for early stage, aggressive breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that signals cell division, growth and differentiation. Defects in FGFR2 expression and signaling are oncogenic and occur in some of the most aggressive and common cancer types, including breast, prostate, esophageal and colorectal cancer. Elevated FGFR2 expression levels are often associated with aggressive tumor behavior, metastasis, and poor prognosis, making it a potential biomarker for disease severity and patient outcomes. In addition to gene amplification and overexpression, mutations in the FGFR2 gene have been identified in various cancer types. These mutations can lead to constitutive activation of FGFR2 signaling pathways, driving tumor growth and progression. Detection of specific FGFR2 mutations may serve as biomarkers for predicting response to targeted therapies, such as FGFR inhibitors. FGFR2 is therefore a promising early cancer biomarker and an important target for cancer therapy, and a need exists for novel methods to assess and manage patients with FGFR2 defects. Researchers have identified a 12 amino acid peptide sequence that shows robust binding affinity and specificity for the extracellular domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). The binding properties of this peptide to FGFR2- and FGFR2-expressing tumor cells have been visualized via multiple in vitro assays and validated with both pre-malignant and malignant biopsy specimens of human esophagus and stomach. Additionally, this peptide binds to the extracellular domain of FGFR2 without interfering with receptor signaling, making it advantageous for diagnostic imaging. The fast target binding, low cost of production, and reduced toxicity make this peptide preferable to existing monoclonal antibodies. This peptide is a promising clinical tool for both the detection and targeted therapy of cancers linked to FGFR2 dysregulation. This innovation can therefore serve as a diagnostic or therapeutic agent for early cancer detection, cancer staging, a method to monitor therapeutic response, or a means for guiding choice of therapy and targeted drug delivery.",

Colon cancer results in over 700,000 global deaths every year and 1.4 million new cases. Early diagnosis has the greatest impact on overall survival in colon cancer patients, given that colon cancer typically develops from precancerous polyps which can grow in the colon for years before becoming cancerous. The main goal of screening is to find these polyps before they turn into cancer or to detect colon cancer in its early stages when treatment is most effective. Colonoscopy is the gold standard employed to screen for colon cancer. Unfortunately, colonoscopy relies on white light to visualize pre-malignant lesions, a challenging task considering roughly 35% of these lesions are flat.

    "ip_description": "Removing magic angle effect from R1rho Dispersion MRI for orientation independent imaging. Maintains intrinsic sensitivity to the structural integrity of collagen fibers. Reveals cartilage alterations in highly structured tissues. A hallmark of joint osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive loss of cartilage that can cause painful joints or even mobility impairments if the loss becomes severe. MRI has the potential to detect early OA and thus will help scientists to develop an interventional strategy to protect or regenerate cartilage. However, conventional compositional MRI suffers from a well-known 'magic angle effect (MAE)' in highly structured tissues such as cartilage tendon and potentially fibrous connective tissues in liver and myocardium, making an early diagnosis on cartilage degeneration in clinical practice extremely challenging. The current technology provides a solution to remove the spatial signal variations resulting from the MAE while maintaining an intrinsic sensitivity to the structural integrity of collagen fibers. This approach allows compositional MRI to be used for characterizing the focalized cartilage degeneration on the same knee in clinical studies. Without separation of MAE from MRI relaxation measurements, the compositional MRI will be only useful for longitudinal studies. Preliminary data on different cartilage tissues, from healthy human knee in vivo to OA human knee ex vivo to enzymatically depleted bovine patellae ex vivo, have demonstrated that a derived order parameter was not only sensitive to collagen degeneration but also free from MAE. This developed technology will provide a new tool for clinical scientists and physicians to reveal cartilage alterations in highly structured tissues.",

Useful in micro-manufacturing, robotics, aerospace engineering, precision instrumentation. Flexure mechanisms have long been used in applications requiring precise, limited movement due to their lack of friction and backlash. Historically, such mechanisms were designed with multiple components that had to be meticulously aligned and assembled. Traditional approaches often struggled with maintaining high stiffness and minimizing error motions, primarily due to the complex assembly and misalignment issues. These limitations restricted their performance, particularly in applications demanding high precision and stability. Existing technologies frequently failed to achieve the necessary balance between flexibility in certain directions and rigidity in load-bearing directions. An improved method is critically needed to achieve superior motion control and stiffness, thereby advancing the capabilities of precision tools and devices across various high-tech industries. Researchers have created a method for fabricating and assembling a spatial parallel kinematic flexure mechanism, comprising a Sandwich module, Interconnect bars, Interconnect plates, and a Motion stage. The Sandwich module, a monolithic body with integrated flexible and rigid elements, facilitates motion in the X and Y directions while restricting movement in the Z, Qx, Qy, and Qz directions. The rigid Interconnect bars and plates further stabilize the device by constraining all six degrees of motion between the intermediate stages. This design significantly enhances performance, offering unparalleled precision and stiffness.

Useful for construction safety, robotics, industrial automation, material handling. Typical construction workflows involve extensive physical interactions, including material handovers, which can pose significant safety risks in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). Historically, ensuring safety during these interactions has been challenging due to the complexity of human grip and response behaviors. Traditional solutions often rely on pre-programmed robotic movements, which lack the adaptability and responsiveness required for safe and efficient handovers. These rigid systems cannot accommodate the dynamic and varied nature of construction sites, leading to potential hazards and inefficiencies. There is a need for improved methods that replicate human behaviors and enhance safety during robot-to-human interactions, benefiting both productivity and worker protection. Researchers have introduced two key innovations to improve safety in robot-to-human material handovers. First, a comprehensive receiver grip state indicator utilizes whole-hand tactile sensors to detect both grip strength and gestures, ensuring that the robot can accurately sense human intent. Second, a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) model is designed to replicate human grip state-reactive behaviors, enabling robots to perform natural and safe handovers based on single demonstrations. This approach surpasses existing techniques by offering a user-friendly programming interface suitable for construction workers without technical expertise.

Lower temperature operation, greater catalyst stability, high reaction rate. Produces propylene from propane with high selectivity and 60% conversion efficiency. Propylene, a crucial building block in the petrochemical industry, is used in the production of several commodity chemicals, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile. Traditional methods of producing propylene utilize cracking of naptha and are characterized by a low selectivity for propylene and high energy requirements. Furthermore, the shift towards shale gas has led to a decrease in the supply of naphtha and a concomitant undersupply of propylene. Propane, a neglected component of shale gas frequently flared and wasted, offers a potential source of propylene through the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process. However, conventional PDH catalysts require high temperatures that lead to unwanted side reactions and necessitate frequent catalyst regeneration. Researchers at the University of Michigan, building upon their prior work with PDH catalysts, have developed an even more efficient catalytic system. The PDH catalyst, comprising PtSn nanoparticles supported on silica, is now incorporated into a hydrogen-permeable hollow fiber silica membrane. Exploiting Le Chatelier's Principle, the system removes hydrogen generated from the PDH reaction to increase propylene production, resulting in propane conversion efficiencies of up 60% while maintaining complete selectivity for propane. This system operates at markedly lower temperatures, which dramatically reduces coking onto the catalyst and lessens the frequency of catalyst regenerations; all without compromising reaction kinetics.",

Silicon Carbide (SiC) exhibits high thermal conductivity and has unique electronic properties that allow it to be used as semiconductor materials. Silicon Nitride (Si3N4) has high strength and fracture toughness at high temperatures, and it therefore has been used in a wide range of industrial applications. Traditionally, SiC and Si3N4 are produced by carbothermal reduction or nitridation of SiO2 at high temperatures. Recent research has focused on using the Silicon Dioxide (SiO2)-rich rice husk as the starting material in SiC and Si3N4 production. However, while this process produces SiC and Si3N4 with good purity, its commercial application is limited due to the production of impurities and agricultural wastes.

    "ip_description": "A method to simulate spatially-discrete traveling-wave modulation. Reduces the computational domain to a single stixel. Reduces costs by derivation of the interpath relation boundary condition. Traveling-wave modulation electromagnetic structures play a pivotal role in the field of metamaterials by facilitating the creation of dynamic metamaterials, allowing real-time adjustments and adaptability to changing environmental conditions or desired functionalities. This modulation provides unique features that enable precise control over electromagnetic waves by manipulating their propagation characteristics, such as frequency, phase, and amplitude. This precision paves the way for transformative advancements in various fields that rely on electromagnetic wave manipulation. Traveling-wave modulation electromagnetic structures provide unique electromagnetic features and can be applied to amplification, frequency conversion, breaking reciprocity, and beam steering. While accurate simulation of the structures is critical to the design and can often be analyzed as continuous structure, spatially discrete structures yield more accurate models. However, simulation of spatially discrete structures can be costly due to the space-time dependency of the unit cells. As such, a need exists for simulations which are more cost efficient. Researchers have developed a procedure for incorporating a novel boundary condition referred to as the 'interpath relation' into existing frequency-domain computational electromagnetic solvers. The method can be used to simulate spatially-discrete traveling-wave modulation (SD-TWM) of electromagnetic structures, where SD-TWM structures are periodic in both space and time. Each spatial period of a SD-TWM structure consists of a number (N) of sub-cells known as 'stixels', or space-time pixels. The time-variation of each stixel can be delayed with respect to the previous stixel by a time delay of T/N, where T is the temporal period of the modulation. The procedure therefore employs the interpath relation to reduce the computational domain to a single stixel. Compared to traditional computational methods, this approach reduces the number of required unknowns by the number of stixels contained within a spatial period. As that number grows, SD-TWM approaches continuous traveling-wave modulation. Therefore, the reduction in unknowns is proves meaningful for the simulation of continuous traveling-wave modulated structures. The derivation of the interpath relation boundary condition also reduces computational costs.",

May also prove beneficial in production of perovskite solar cells. Prolonged exposure of excessive gamma radiation exposure is known to carry risks to human health. Consequently, military security and defense, nuclear medicine imaging, and general environmental radioactivity monitoring all require sensitive gamma radiation detection. Perovskite semiconductors have been shown to be powerful gamma ray detectors with advantages in sensitivity and resolution compared to traditional methods. While perovskite is a mineral, in this setting it refers to a specific 3D structure type that possesses structural properties ideal for gamma ray detection and other photonic applications. However, the widespread adoption of these technologies can be limited by the complexity and cost associated with material fabrication. The thin film technology developed for solar cell perovskite do not translate well into gamma detectors. As such, a need exists for a reliable fabrication method for perovskite materials that perform gamma radiation spectroscopy at a level capable of replacing existing methods. Researchers have invented a crystallization process as well as surface passivation techniques for producing organolead halide perovskite single crystals (PSCs) for the purpose of spectroscopic photon and particle detection. This innovation describes a solution-based method to coat the PSCs with mono- or multi-molecular layers of material chemically or ionically bonded to the PSC surface. The approach reduces the presence of surface gangling bonds and associated carrier trapping states within the PSC bandgap. This method builds on previous inverse-temperature crystallization methods to obtain crystals with minimal surface roughness, as characterized by SEM, and optimal radiation detection. The process therefore optimizes the crystallization process to creating smooth-surfaced PSCs exhibiting surface passivation necessary to produce reliable radiation detectors. Overall, the gamma radiation detection of these treated PSCs proves to be comparable to standard methods with increased resolution.",

Allows for decreased battery size and increased EV trip range. While electrical vehicles have made strides in the automotive market, they are still limited by imperfect charging station infrastructure and the heavy weight of car batteries. Limited driving range as well as the existence of geographic areas with sparsely situated charging stations contribute to driver anxiety and deter potential EV buyers. One further barrier to a more widespread adoption of EVs includes an initial higher purchase price which results partly from the expense associated with batteries. The costs of replacing worn out EV batteries must be taken into account when calculating the long term expense of vehicle purchase. Also, from a convenience standpoint, recharging EVs during a long trip requires a larger time investment than does refilling the gas tank for a traditionally powered or even hybrid vehicle. So, a need exists for methods to decrease initial EV cost, to improve options to charge them, and to improve market penetration by allaying the concerns of potential buyers. Researchers have created a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) tethered power transfer (TPT) between electronic vehicles (EVs) to facilitate frequent, real-time, and on-demand charging. V2V TPT mimics aerial refueling of fighter planes, which permits those jets to function with smaller fuel tanks while remaining lighter, fuel efficient, and more nimble. In V2V TPT, EVs equipped with retractable charging apparatus (e.g., tethers or booms) deploy automatically between a charging and receiving vehicle while they are in motion. V2V TPT may be utilized through a sharing paradigm where EVs and other specialized charging vehicles form a mobile network of crowd-sourced power storage and supply. A well-designed V2V TPT system will allow for a drastic reduction in battery size which can correspondingly decrease vehicle cost. Initial analysis suggests the possibility for 50% reduction in EV battery size which reduces energy consumption as a result of smaller vehicle weight. This innovation may therefore increase the penetration rate of EVs due to a lower vehicle purchase cost as well as increased range that results from a lighter weight.",

Enables systematic studies of the effects of diet and gene expression on metabolism. Human metabolism influences daily functioning and can be linked to obesity-related diseases such as diabetes mellitus. The methods for studying metabolism have historically involved either respirometry or calorimetry analysis. Respirometry calculates an organism's oxygen consumption rate by measuring the decrease in partial pressure of oxygen in a closed system, though it only calculates aerobic metabolic rate and has a slow response time. Calorimetry measures heat production of an organism and captures a total rate which represents both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. While the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as an important biologic model for studying metabolism owing to their rapid lifespan, similar digestive system as mammals, ease of genetic manipulation, accurate measurements of metabolic rate for such small organisms has proven challenging. As such, a need exists for an apparatus that can measure heat output and thus metabolic rate for Drosophila and other small organisms. Researchers have created a direct calorimetry device that calculates metabolic rate by sensitive heat output measurement. This technology provides a new method for measuring metabolism of fruit flies and other small organisms through the use of a direct calorimetry approach. The device utilizes sensitive thermistors in conjunction with real time monitoring equipment to measure heat expenditure while simultaneously allowing researchers to observe behavior associated with changes in metabolic rate. It is capable of providing temperature readings at a resolution of \u00b130 micro-Kelvin, making it much more sensitive than currently available technologies. The tool supports concurrent measurements on multiple individual fruit flies for improved throughput, it enables systematic studies of the effects of diet and gene expression on metabolism, and it facilitates studies to clarify the link between metabolism and lifespan or aging.

High thermal conductivity is an important quality of polymers for applications in which heat must be dissipated efficiently (e.g. LED packaging, electronic devices). Low thermal conductivities in bulk polymers are believed to occur due to entangled structures, which exhibit significant void space and weak interchain interactions. Blending with high-conductivity fillers such as metal or ceramic particles, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or graphene flakes is the most commonly used method to enhance thermal conductivity for polymeric materials. Unfortunately, this approach results in a tradeoff of undesirable optical/electrical properties, increased weight, high cost, and ease of processing. As such, the need exists for an improved design of bulk polymers. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a generalizable method to increase the thermal conductivity of a bulk polymer. The strategy utilizes the repulsion of electrostatic charges on polyelectrolyte polymers to straighten the individual chains so that they can align in parallel fashion. Bulk polyelectrolyte polymers comprising an ionizable repeating pendant group are contacted with an aqueous liquid having a pH that ionizes the pendant group and isotropically extend the polyelectrolyte polymer to a straightened, non-globular chain conformation. The polyelectrolyte polymer so treated thus exhibits a thermal conductivity that is significantly greater than the untreated, amorphous polymer.

Provides excellent interfacial layer adhesion and mechanical strength. Established routes to convert methane to ethane rely on indirect, energy-intensive steam reforming, which necessitates production at large scale. In comparison, direct methane conversion processes, such as oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) offer potential for greater energy and carbon atom efficiency, and are better suited for placement at smaller, more remote methane sources. Unfortunately, OCM systems to date have suffered from poor ethane selectivity, largely due to a mismatch between the rate of oxygen transport and the rate of catalyst activation, which results in over-oxidation side reactions that form unwanted CO and CO2. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a hollow fiber membrane reactor that utilizes an asymmetric dual-layer fiber to provide better control over oxygen flux and catalyst activation. The result is an OCM reactor capable of 30% methane conversion at 65% ethane (and higher hydrocarbons) selectivity. The membranes are made using an additive manufacturing process employing a continuous, simultaneous phase inversion approach. The process provides excellent control over catalyst layer thickness, which allows the number of active catalytic sites and by extension the rate of methane activation within the membrane to be tuned to match the flux of oxygen. Additionally, the manufacturing process is also simplified as compared to prior processes, requiring only a single sintering step. The hollow fiber geometry results in high volumetric reaction rates (greater than 0.2 mL of product forming per minute per square centimeter of membrane) and lower overall reactor volumes. The membranes display excellent interfacial layer adhesion and mechanical strength. The small diameter of the hollow fibers provides for enhanced heat transfer and improved heat management.",

The design is scalable and easily cleaned and maintained. The UM reactor design has been shown to improve upon the residence time distribution and flow uniformity while minimizing channeling compared to a standard packed bed reactor of equivalent volume. To maximize the surface area of photocatalyst that is in direct contact with light, the thickness of the annular region containing the packed catalyst has been optimized and smaller catalyst particles are used. The reactor utilizes a thermocouple embedded directly in the catalyst bed to ensure temperature accuracy. While the reactor built by UM was deliberately sized for bench scale studies, it was built with scalability in mind and should also be suitable for larger scale industrial photoprocesses. The annular design provides an opportunity for scale-up without loss of uniform and maximized illumination of the catalyst. By utilizing a quartz reactor body instead of stainless steel, stronger cleaning agents such as aqua regia and piranha solution may be used to contamination built up through extended use. Although designed with solar applications in mind, the photoreactor can be equipped with the user's external light source of choice, including high efficiency LEDs.

    "ip_description": "An improved design for vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lamps that extends the operational lifetime of argon VUV lamps to 1,000+ hours (10x improvement) and protects lamp windows from both exterior and interior causes of degradation. Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lamps are widely used in many applications, including for ionization of gas phase molecules in gas analysis and detection. VUV lamps emit through a window, which must be transparent to the high-energy, short-wavelength photons created by the plasma inside the lamp. Typical VUV window materials are susceptible to degradation and the formation of color centers, which are caused by exposure to exterior moisture, highly energetic species within the lamp, and VUV photons. Due to transparency requirements of particularly high energy lamps, such as argon VUV lamps, LiF must be used as the lamp window material. Unfortunately, LiF is particularly susceptible to moisture and color center formation. While a MgF2 window may withstand a few thousand hours of operation, a LiF window typically lasts only about 100 hours. This makes argon VUV lamps very expensive and their lifetime notoriously short. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a VUV lamp design that protects the LiF window from exterior moisture as well as the ions, electrons, and excited-state gas molecules within the lamp chamber. The protective coatings increase lamp lifetime by 10x while maintaining LiF's excellent VUV transmission properties (60-70% for photons with energies from 8.5 to 11.5 eV). The design avoids the many shortcomings of alternative approaches based on thin metal films. An added benefit is that the coating of the UM design may be regenerated using a secondary, deep UV (DUV) light source and/or a heat treatment. This technology is suitable for any VUV lamp (krypton, xenon, e.g.) and is particularly desirable for argon lamps, with their very high energy photon emissions. The coating may be applied by any microfabrication process for dielectric deposition, such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), sputtering, or atomic layer deposition (ALD).",

    "ip_description": "A photochromic paint which can be used as a display medium. Paint changes color when exposed to different light wavelengths. Can extend digital content to all display images for many applications. Conventional technologies like television screens, video projectors and distributed displays have traditionally been applied to create pervasive and interactive displays. These technologies have played a significant role in various settings, from entertainment venues to commercial spaces and public environments. Television screens have been a staple in households, offering a centralized display for broadcasting content and providing an immersive viewing experience. Video projectors have enabled large-scale projections on screens or surfaces, enabling the creation of cinematic experiences in theaters, conferences, and events. However, traditional display technologies do not scale to room-wide applications due to high per-unit-area costs and the need for constant wired power and data infrastructure. A new category of display promises to present our digital content seamlessly throughout our environment. So, a need exists for pervasive and interactive displays that improve upon limitations of conventional technologies such as high per-unit-area costs, cumbersome deployment methods, and the need for constant wired power and data infrastructure. Researchers have discovered a photochromic paint which can be used as a display medium that can be applied to any surface or object to create ultra-low-cost displays. The photochromic material is normally white, and the paint changes color when exposed to specific wavelengths of light. The images and user interfaces can last up to 16 minutes and be updated indefinitely. These new paint formulations can therefore enable a wide area of applications for photochromic materials. Along with a specially modified wide-area laser projector and depth camera that can draw custom images and create on-demand, room-wide user interfaces may exist on photochromic enabled surfaces. System parameters such as light intensity, material activation time, and user readability are examined to optimize the display. Finally, usage scenarios such as displaying static and dynamic images, ephemeral notifications, and the creation of on-demand interfaces such as light switches and music controllers are demonstrated and explored. Ultimately the UbiChromics system demonstrates the possibility of extending digital content to all painted surfaces.",

    "ip_description": "A Silicon (Si)-based thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell with high out-of-band (OOB) reflectivity. Utilizes the advantages of Silicon including wide availability and low cost. Leads to improved efficiency through minimization of energy loss. Thermophotovoltaic cells (TPVs) can scavenge excess heat energy from high temperature source such as furnaces, engines or turbines, through conversion from the hot emitter into electricity. These devices utilize the principle of blackbody radiation, converting radiated photons from the hot emitter into electricity. TPV cells are designed with specialized materials that can efficiently absorb and convert those photons into electron-hole pairs, generating an electric current. Unlike photovoltaic (PV) devices, emitter temperature depends on the heat source, and the distance between the cell and the heat source can be within close proximity. Therefore, engineering the reflectivity of the cell can help improve the power conversion efficiency by minimizing the energy loss from unabsorbed out of band (OOB) photons. A need exists to maximize the ability of TVCs to scavenge and convert excess heat energy that would otherwise go unused, offering a potential solution for improving energy efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of these industrial applications. Researchers have created a Silicon (Si)-based thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell with high out-of-band (OOB) reflectivity facilitated by an air-bridge back surface reflector. The advantage of using Si as the absorber material is that it is widely available and cost-effective. As such, the use of Si can overcome the potential limits of scalability and expensive manufacturing costs associated with conventional TPC materials such as Indium Gallium arsenide (InGaAs) or Indium antimonide (InSb). The design incorporates a structured air gap between the silicon absorber and the reflector, optimizing the reflection of OOB photons while allowing efficient transmission of in-band photons for absorption. The air-bridge structure enables precise control over the reflectivity spectrum, enhancing the overall performance of the TPV cell. Previously, an InGaAs TPV cell with air-bridge back surface reflector was reported, with PCE improvement from 24% to 32% compared to the same cell with gold back reflector. The available data suggests that with high OOB reflectivity, even higher bandgap materials such as Si can achieve reasonably high efficiency by reflecting back the OOB photons and thus minimizing the major energy loss.",

    "ip_description": "AI and optimization-based optical structure design algorithm for structural color. Uses a material screening model, a structural parameters prediction model, and particle swarm optimization. An environmental-friendly alternative to chrome coatings and reconstructing pictures. Structural color refers to the color generated through the light interaction with patterned or layered optical structures. Designing optical structures to obtain user-specified properties such as color targets is not a trivial task due to the complex relationship between the optical structures and the perceived color by human eyes. The human visual system is sensitive to variations in light and color, creating challenges when attempting to engineer optical structures to achieve desired colors. Though machine learning-based inverse design methods have previously been developed for obtaining optical structure designs given specific color targets, most of these approaches do not consider the potential for searching from a variety of materials to achieve the best color targets. The inability to search and select the best materials leads to sub-optimal design performance or makes it impossible to obtain colors specific to the materials' fixed reflection and absorption properties. So, a need exists to improve our understanding of color perception, to develop reliable design methods, and to create efficient means by which to manage the complex relationship between structures and generated colors. Researchers have developed a hybrid inverse design method termed Neural Particle Swarm Optimization that combines a material screening model, a structural parameters prediction model, and particle swarm optimization to obtain structural color designs with appropriate materials. Mixture Density Networks (MDN), a class of neural network models that returns multimodal conditional probability distributions, assesses materials and associated design parameter values to fine-tune the predicted design parameter values. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) involves a type of optimization that solves a problem by having a group of candidate solutions moving in the search space influenced by local solutions. This method demonstrates exceptional design accuracy and efficiency on designing environmental-friendly alternatives to chrome coatings and reconstructing pictures with structural colors based on multilayer optical thin films. Pictures with more than 200,000 pixels can be reconstructed within 2 to 3 hours with an almost unnoticeable difference from the original picture. The invention can be adopted for wide range of other optical design tasks that require optimizing the material selections and structural parameters.",

Creates tandem PV cells with a few microns of semiconductor thin films exhibiting mechanical stability. Tandem photovoltaic (PV) devices have top and bottom cells comprised of different materials and bandgaps, for instance semiconductors and silicon. The two materials are electrically connected by insertion of a heavily doped tunnel junction layer between them. One challenge presented when developing tandem PVs is achieving efficient light absorption and management across layers. Additionally, suitable materials must be found with desirable bandgaps and complementary properties for each subcell, specifically those which are stable, durable, and that possess high carrier mobility. These materials must also exhibit thin film growth and show an ability to form a tunnel junction region with heavily doped p- and n-type layers. Semiconductors mostly have different lattice constants, which limit lattice-matched epitaxial growth on a substrate. So, a need exists for improved materials that can be epitaxially grown on a substrate with the goals of enhancing solar energy conversion efficiency and enabling more efficient and sustainable photovoltaic technologies. Researchers have developed a tandem photovoltaic (PV) which is capable of including III-V semiconductors, silicon, a cathode electrode, an anode electrode, and a gold-to-gold metal bridge electrode. The semiconductors include p-typed and n-typed regions, and separate bottom and top PV cells can be independently fabricated to form a tandem PV structure. The invention does not require heavy-doped tunnel junctions and a lattice-matched material interface between the bottom and top cells. The bottom and the top PVs are electrically connected by the gold-to-gold metal bridge interconnection, which is positioned between the bottom and the top PV cells. The metal bridge may be formed by a cold-welding compression technique, enabling fabrication of highly efficient tandem thermophotovoltaics with 3D stack of air-bridges. This invention therefore creates tandem PV cells with a few microns of semiconductor thin films exhibiting mechanical stability. This structure is therefore compatible with the development of tandem PVs as well as thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells.",

It provides accurate location capabilities for stationary or moving users. Device-free localization methods allow users to benefit from location-aware services without the need to carry a transponder. However, conventional radio sensing and imaging approaches using active wireless nodes require wired power or continual battery maintenance, limiting deployability. Attempts have therefore been made to use technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or ambient signals to locate an individual in a specific geographic setting. The goal would be to analyze variations and patterns in the signals received to accurately estimate a user\u2019s location to provide personalized recommendations, contextual notifications, or optimized navigation. So, a need exists for alternative approaches that enable flexible and scalable deployment of radio sensing and imaging technologies. Researchers have discovered a real-time, multi-user ultra-high frequency (UHF) radiofrequency identification (RFID) tomographic localization system. The technology, known as TomoID, uses low-level communication channel parameters such as received signal strength indicator (RSSI), radiofrequency phase (RF), and Read Rate to create probability heatmaps of user's locations. The heatmaps are transferred to a custom-designed signal processing and machine learning pipeline to robustly locate users. Study results show that TomoID provides accurate location with an average mean error of 17 cm for a stationary user and 19 cm when they are walking and moving. The device also demonstrates multi-user tracking with an average mean error of 40 cm and 72 cm with two and three users.

Combines evaluation of red, green, and blue (RGB) lights with thermal imaging. Able to completely remove PII and work in concert with computer vision (CV) methodologies. The increased use of surveillance cameras to monitor areas and enhance security has led to inadvertent capture of personally identifiable information (PII) compromising individuals' privacy. These concerns are significant for recordings made in crowded urban environments, and they limit the use of cameras in privacy-sensitive settings such as the home, workplace, and hospitals. The details about when the PII removal occurs, and under whose direction, are important factors to address when attempting to maximize the moral and legal aspects of the process. The removal of PII before storage is important to minimize the potential damage of data breaches. Still, manual identification and redaction of PII proves time-consuming and prone to errors, while automated systems can result in false positives or negatives. And, the commonly employed pixelation or blurring of sensitive data offered by existing systems can be reversed by available image processing and artificial intelligence. So, a need exists for improved methods to detect and remove PII from images captured by surveillance cameras. Researchers have created a method that proposes pairing the evaluation of red, green, and blue (RGB) lights with thermal imaging to robustly detect and remove personally identifiable information (PII). The technology is capable of removing PII such as facial patterns, skin color, gender, body shape, and more before the images are stored or transferred from the device. This RGB Thermal camera contains an embedded graphics processing unit (GPU) capable of performing real-time privacy sanitization tasks at 8 frames per second (FPS) while using less than 5 watts of power. The device may function in its most fail safe setting to completely remove all PII, though a more permissive setting maintains full compatibility with downstream computer vision (CV) methods to successfully sanitize 99% of faces.

Relevant for space, automotive (Lidar), and power electronics (VHF) applications. Ultrafast and isolated gate drivers are needed in LiDAR for range accuracy and resolution, in very-high-frequency (VHF) for minimizing loss and expanding the range of operation, and in space applications for increasing reliability with isolation. With these capabilities, pulse and VHF power electronics can be designed to operate at higher frequencies, allowing for smaller, lighter, and more efficient systems. Still, challenges in ultrafast gate driver design include maximizing fast switching transitions for narrow pulses and higher frequency as defined by an ultrafast slew rate. The gate driver must also reside at the same potential as the power device, so the device should be set up with isolation between the controller and gate. The devices require variable frequency and duty cycle for current and voltage modulation and adjusting pulse width, with some methods dependent upon automatic DC restoration for duty-cycle preservation. So, a need exists for improved gate drivers that optimize these characteristics. Researchers have developed an architecture for an isolated, variable duty cycle, ultrafast gate driver and hardware capable of achieving a gate voltage slew rate of 12 GV/s with rise and fall times below 260/ps. This device is the fastest isolated gate drive architecture discovered to date, with magnetic isolation that ensures common-mode transient immunity and positive feedback which provides automatic DC restoration to preserve variable duty cycles. While performing at a slew rate of 12 GV/s, the gate driver can operate at 100 MHz with a gating loss of 108 mW per switch at a driving voltage of 5 V. The device can therefore drive a pulse power device with a slew rate of greater than 37 GV/s, improving total efficiency by 8%. Further refinements on this approach should prove useful in applications that require high-frequency switching, such as power inverters, motor drives, and switched-mode power supplies.",

Improves research and industrial applications in MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated metal sites. DME is an inexpensive solvent that addresses a long term issue of MOF performance and variability. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of highly porous materials that consist of metal ions or clusters coordinated with organic ligands. The production of MOFs creates three dimensional structures that are highly porous, exhibit low density, and have a large surface area. Their low density contains a large fraction of void space, within which countless functionalities can be designed based on the desired applications. The ability to customize these factors has let to tens of thousands of MOFs with diverse chemical and physical properties.

Still, MOF structures vary greatly and create difficulty producing theoretical predictions of their properties.

Researchers have devised a method of MOF activation by the displacement of residual solvent through the use of dimethyl ether (DME). This innovation expands upon the knowledge that ultralow surface tension, low boiling point solvents permit milder MOF activation conditions with coordinatively unsaturated metal centers. This approach addresses a long term issue of MOF performance and variability. In this setting, DME acts as both a solvent and a ligand, allowing for a more efficient and versatile synthesis process.

    "ip_description": "Characterization of multiple rheological properties in extension of Newtonian liquids. The approach improves upon an existing technique called capillary breakup rheometry (CBR). Can be used with existing instrumentation to measure sample viscosity and surface tension. Newtonian fluids are those that have a constant viscosity regardless of any applied shear rate or stress. Capillary breakup rheometry (CBR) is a traditional method for characterizing extensional properties of fluids that can form a liquid bridge. Capillary rheometers are primarily used for measuring the viscosity of suspensions and slurries containing relatively large particles, at high particle loadings such as polymer melts, ceramic slurries, foodstuffs, inks, and coatings. The method for CBR involves injection of a small amount of fluid into a thin capillary tube after which it is subjected to a slight, time-varying pressure pulse. This approach causes the fluid to stretch and then break into droplets, and the size and shape of these droplets can be analyzed to determine the fluid's viscosity and other properties. Capillary breakup rheometry is particularly useful for measuring the high shear rates that occur in many industrial processes, such as injection molding or extrusion, where the viscosity of the fluid is a critical parameter. The technique is also used in fundamental research to study the dynamics of fluid flow and the physics of droplet breakup. While CBR is advantageous over conventional rheometers because it does not require a force measurement, so it is useful for low-viscosity fluids where small forces are difficult to measure. Still, existing CBR technologies underpredict viscosity and are limited to dynamic viscosities of 70 millipascal seconds (mPa-s). So, a need exists for an improved CBR that is capable of overcoming these shortcomings. Researchers have developed a method for characterization of multiple rheological properties in extension of Newtonian liquids, including viscosity and surface tension. The modified procedure involves imposing an oscillatory deformation profile to a filament in a manner that improves upon existing methods for capillary breakup rheometry (CBR). This innovation involves imposing an oscillatory deformation profile to a filament initially placed between two parallel plates. This technology can be used with existing instrumentation, and it helps prevent filament break-up. Oscillation can be performed with optical photography such as capabilities included in smart phones to measure the filament diameter at midpoint. This approach can be used for the characterization of multiple rheological properties in extension of Newtonian liquids, and it has the potential to be developed to incorporate linear viscoelasticity. The set-up can be likely be extended to also include the measurement of a non-Newtonian relaxation time. Further modifications will seek to optimize the measurement of surface tension and viscosity ratios, permitting a better understanding of the limits of the proposed procedure.",

Diseases in which the skin barrier is disturbed, such as atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and psoriasis, are associated with elevated TEWL. Given that TEWL is a key indicator of the skin barrier function, its measurement proves essential in a wide range of clinical and personal care applications. Existing TEWL measurement devices fall either into those with an open system or devices with a closed system.

Researchers have invented a technology that provides transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements in a manner that corrects for limitations in existing devices through the use of a closed chamber and dry clean air supply. Through this method, an active pump provides dry and clean air from either an external or internal source to first purge, clean, and dry the skin surface as well as the detection chamber away from the skin. The skin and humidity sensor in the detection chamber therefore become dry with a relative humidity (RH) close to 0%, and the TEWL can be extracted from subsequent humidity readings as the skin releases moisture. The invention allows for a marked improvement over existing systems that require significant energy to decrease humidity by cooling a closed chamber and collecting water vapor on condensing coils. This advancement provides improved patient comfort with wearable technology, continuous monitoring, low energy consumption, and no ambient interference.",

    "ip_description": "Improved methodology for gas chromatography (GC) systems. Greater control over run times, peak shapes, eluent order. Electronic tuning of binding energy without heating. Gas chromatography (GC) is a ubiquitous analytical technique, used widely in environmental, industrial, biomedical, forensics, and research applications. GC instrumentation relies on the interaction of mobile vapor molecules traveling through a column coated with a stationary phase. Separation of analytes in a sample is achieved due to the varying strengths of interaction of each analyte with the stationary phase, resulting in varying elution times. In many applications, it is desirable to adjust the interaction ('binding energy') between the vapor molecules and the stationary phase, often mid-run of the sample. Doing so can decrease the run time of the sample, increase the number of eluent peaks collected, sharpen and correct peak shape. Currently, heating of the stationary phase is the most common method for adjusting the binding energy. Disadvantages of this method include greater power use, long cool-down times, and more complicated circuitry. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a GC system that utilizes graphene as the stationary phase and is particularly suitable for microGCs. Graphene inherently displays varying binding energies with various vapor molecules, which leads to separation of those vapor molecules. By configuring graphene into a field effect transistor (FET) design, the molecule-graphene interaction can be tuned by adjusting the graphene Fermi level through the FET gate voltage. This allows greater control over the elution time and/or elution order of vapor molecules in the sample. This GC design has several advantages. Compared to polymer-based stationary phases, the graphene stationary phase has higher chemical robustness without bleed issues. Electronic tuning of the binding energy requires far less electrical power than heating, is more responsive, and does not require lengthy cool down periods between sample runs. The graphene GC is smaller, portable, and able to operate at a low temperature.",

Mixed-signal circuits for high-voltage for WRITE operations and low-voltage for READ operations. A fast, low-cost, and high-density architecture for non-volatile memory. Crossbar array non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies are used for high-density memory applications and consist of horizontal and vertical wires that intersect at specific points. Memory elements at these points can be programmed to exist in either a high or low resistance state, representing a binary one or zero. The analog and digital circuit hardware that functions on the non-volatile memory crossbar arrays connects to the periphery of the crossbar structure through an analog switch matrix. While row hardware is designed to match the pitch of the NVM crossbar array rows, column hardware matches the pitch of the NVM crossbar array columns. Specialized mixed-signal circuits provide high-voltage to write NVM devices versus low-voltage to read programmed NVM devices. In spite of the advantages of this arrangement, a need exists for improved efficiency of NVM technologies. Researchers have created a technology that consists of row hardware and column hardware which provide the minimum number of switches and high-voltage level shifters for mixed high voltage and low voltage operation of computer circuits. This technology is a unique architecture for both the row and column switch matrix that is connected to a crossbar array non-volatile memory.

Able to preserve privacy-preserving daily activity recognition. Sound presents an invaluable signal source that enables computing systems to perform daily activity recognition. Microphones are commonly calibrated for human hearing which ranges from 85 Hz to 255 Hz, capturing private content such as speech while omitting useful, inaudible information. In circumstances where microphones are applied to perform acoustic recognition of sounds outside of human communication, human speech is extraneous. For instance, microphones are useful in smart home applications to detect sounds and alert homeowners about specific sounds such as a smoke detector going off or glass breaking. In public, microphones can monitor the sounds of traffic patterns or detect the sound of gunshots to produce appropriate interventions. While voices can be edited out of recordings in circumstances where capturing human speech is not the intent, that arrangement justifiably leads to privacy concerns. As such, a need exists for a system that can filter audio in hardware so that the raw output is private and does not require post-capture editing. Inventors have developed a system that can filter audio in hardware so that the raw output is private, by design. They formulated a method that captures inaudible acoustic frequencies with settings that can remove speech or all audible frequencies entirely, thereby creating microphones that understand what is happening around them without recording speech. The microphone is optimized for high audible and ultrasonic frequency ranges, thereby filtering out audio in the audible range and avoiding frequency ranges that contain potentially private information. This approach utilizes commercially available, low cost, credit-card sized computers that plug into a monitor or TV and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. The researchers have simulated acoustic recognition tasks using sounds from 127 everyday household or workplace objects and discovered that inaudible frequencies can act as a substitute for privacy-sensitive frequencies. An evaluative perception study arranged for participants to 'eavesdrop' on PrivacyMic's filtered audio, and none of them were able to transcribe speech from the noises. PrivacyMic's real-world activity recognition performance compares favorably to simulated results, with over 95% classification accuracy across all environments. These results suggest immediate viability in performing privacy-preserving daily activity recognition, and the device has applications in smart home spaces as well as in the internet of things (IoT).",

Provides a means by to improve field miniaturization and decrease field cancellation. Combines WPT and cancelling coils together, arranged with opposite-phase currents. Wireless power transfer is a technology that enables the transmission of electrical power from a power source to an electronic device without the need for physical wires or connectors. This technology works by using an electromagnetic field to transfer power wirelessly between two objects, typically a transmitter and a receiver. Wireless power transfer has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly in applications such as electric vehicles, mobile devices, wearable or implantable medical devices, and internet of things (IoT) devices. The technology offers several advantages, including increased convenience and flexibility, reduced clutter, and improved safety, in as much as there is no risk of electric shock from exposed wires. However, wireless power transfer also has some limitations, such as decreased efficiency when compared to wired connections as well as the need for compatible devices to use the technology. Additionally, the wireless power transfer (WPT) coils that encircle these applications correlate with sensitivity to magnetic fields, especially at higher frequencies, leading to field cancellation. Existing measures that try to correct for field cancellation may prove complex and inefficient, so a need exists for improved methods to manage field cancellation. Researchers have invented a method that minimizes the magnetic field for the encircled coils in wireless power transfer (WPT) coils using a two-coil structure, allowing for field miniaturization while diminishing field cancellation. The WPT and cancelling coils are driven together by a single current-mode class D power converter with opposite-phase currents to optimize the field cancelation within the coils. The current magnitude of the canceling coil is independently determined and fixed using the same driver for the WPT coil. Additionally, a thin sensing coil encircling the circuits is used to measure the magnetic flux. Using this cancelling method, the magnetic field for the encircled circuits can be reduced by 99% in hardware when compared to existing approaches that lack cancellation. Overall, this invention successfully optimizes methods for very high frequency WPT systems that achieve miniaturization and effectively prevent field cancellation.",

Storage of multiple bits of information across memory cell groups for deep neural network information weighting. May be implemented by one or more computer programs that are run by a single or multiple processors. Machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) tasks use neural networks to learn and then to infer. Learning refers to the process of tuning the weight values by training the network on vast amounts of data, while inference describes the process of presenting the network with new data for classification. The workhorse of many types of neural networks is vector-matrix multiplication, a procedure that produces computations between an input and weight matrix. Crossbar mapping is a method of implementing deep neural network (DNN) weights that can achieve high energy efficiency and low latency in hardware implementations. This technique involves mapping the weight values of a DNN onto the programmable resistive crossbar structure of a memristive (i.e., resistive random-access memory) device. The crossbar structure is composed of a set of parallel conductive wires that are connected to programmable resistive elements, which can store the weight values of the DNN. Still, a need exists to map the weights of one or more kernels of a neural network onto a crossbar array in order to improve computational efficiency. Researchers have developed a method that maps weights for kernels onto a crossbar array comprised of non-volatile memory cells that serves as an aid for machine learning and inference by deep neural networks (DNN). This technology involves the arrangement of memory cells into columns and rows such that each row of the array is interconnected by a respective drive line and each column of the array is interconnected by a respective bit line. As the system receives two or more kernels of a neural network that are represented as values in a matrix that are converted into column vectors and stored. The computing system either employs an analog approach where an analog value is stored in the memristor of each memory cell or a digital approach which stores binary values in the memory cells. For a binary number comprised of multiple bits, the memory cells are collected into groups of memory cells, such that the value of each bit in the binary number is stored in a different memory cell within the group of memory cells. For example, a value for each bit in a five-bit binary number is stored in a group of five adjacent columns of the array, where the value for the most significant bit is stored in memory cell on the leftmost column of a group and the value for the least significant bit is stored in memory cell in the rightmost column of a group. In this way, a multiplicand of a multiply-accumulate operation is a binary number comprised of multiple bits and stored across a one group of memory cells in the array, facilitating crossbar weighting of the DNN values. The hardware arrangement of the system includes a data bus that is interfaced with or connected to the data bus in addition to a plurality of crossbar modules that are also connected to the data bus. Peripheral hardware includes a drive line circuit, a wordline circuit, and a bitline circuit that are designed to minimize the number of switches and level-shifters needed for mixing high-voltage and low-voltage operation. This peripheral hardware supports read and write operations in relation to the memory cells which comprise the crossbar array. If a circumstance arises in which the kernel dimensions or number of kernels in one layer are too large to fit into a single crossbar array, multiple crossbar arrays may be utilized. As described, this system may be implemented by one or more computer programs that are run by a single or multiple processors.",

Overcomes challenges designing high voltage and high current accurate pulse generators. Reduces DC circuit interrupter stress by effectively achieving zero current switching to alleviate arcing. Power one-shot pulse generators are essential tools in many industrial, scientific, and medical applications that require a high-energy electrical pulse in response to a trigger. These generators are designed to deliver a single, high-power pulse of electrical energy in response to an input trigger signal, making them ideal for applications such as pulsed power, plasma generation, and particle accelerators. In industrial settings, one-shot pulse generators are commonly used for welding, cutting, and forming of materials, as well as for non-destructive testing of materials and components. For scientific applications, these generators are used for a range of experiments, including high-energy physics, nuclear fusion, and laser physics. Used in medical applications, one-shot pulse generators are used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, such as in electroconvulsive therapy for treating severe depression. With their ability to deliver high-energy pulses quickly and accurately, power one-shot pulse generators are crucial tools for advancing research and development in a wide range of fields. Therefore, a need exists for high power one-shot pulse generators that respond quickly to a trigger for industrial, scientific, and medical applications. Researchers have invented a design method and hardware results for a modular 4.5 kV pulse generator that delivers a 100A peak current pulse for an 800 ns flat-top duration, which can potentially scale to tens of kilovolts. A fast-response, flat-top current pulse can help dc circuit interrupters achieve zero current switching, which alleviates arcing, reduces semiconductor device stress, and improves circuit design while reducing stress on the device. When a current pulse with a fast rise time and flat top is applied to a semiconductor device, it creates a uniform magnetic field that counteracts the inductive voltage drop across the device, allowing the current to decrease to zero quickly and smoothly. This process reduces the likelihood of arcing, which can damage the device and decrease its lifespan. Additionally, zero current switching can improve circuit design by reducing the need for snubbers, which are components used to suppress voltage transients caused by arcing. The innovation overcomes several challenges in designing high voltage and high current accurate pulse generators, including: (a) parasitics from the necessary large physical format that degrade pulse quality and complicate design; (b) modularity that is economical in using fewer lower voltage semiconductor switches; and (c) optimality in the tradeoff among response time, pulse flat-top duration, and component selection. Therefore, by using a fast-response, flat-top current pulse to achieve zero current switching, this DC circuit interrupter can operate more efficiently and reliably, reducing stress on semiconductor devices and improving overall circuit performance.",

Provides a circular array that can achieve angular resolution far less than one degree. Generates 4-D images that are accurate, consistent, and which can be used with high-speed SAR. Imaging radar technology is a type of remote sensing technology that uses radar pulses to create high-resolution images of a surface. The technology works by emitting a radar signal towards a surface and then measuring the time it takes for the signal to bounce back to the sensor. By analyzing the properties of the returned signal, such as its amplitude, frequency, and polarization, imaging radar can create detailed images of stationary objects, such as the Earth's surface, with resolutions ranging from a few meters to a few centimeters. Beam scanning or synthetic aperture radar are the most common technologies used in imaging radars. Beam scanning involves electronic beam steering or mechanical moving of an antenna, though this approach has a limited angle resolution of only 1-2 degrees. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide high resolution two-dimensional (2D) images for stationary targets, which is accomplished by moving the radar platform at a constant speed. SAR can be therefore be limited when utilized for stationary radar or for capturing targets with an unknown path or velocity. So, a need exists for a high-resolution radar that mitigates the limitations of existing technologies. Researchers have developed a very high-resolution imaging radar which employs a special antenna composed of a stationary feed, a main reflector, and a rotating sub-reflector. This technology provides a 3D image by utilizing a main reflector and sub-reflector to achieve high resolution in azimuth (the horizontal angle of a compass bearing) and elevation. The mechanism focuses the image from the feed through sub-reflector onto the electrically large main reflector, and then it is moved around as the sub-reflector rotates. The design provides a complete rotation that can form a large, synthetic circular array which can achieve smaller than fraction of a degree angular resolution. The invention can generate 4-D radar images that define azimuth, elevation, range, and speed.

The process of machine learning or (AI) involves the use of neural networks to learn and then to infer. Learning refers to the process of tuning the weight values by training the network on vast amounts of data, while inference refers to the process of presenting the network with new data for classification. The mainstay of many types of neural networks is vector-matrix multiplication, or computation between an input and weight matrix. Crossbar arrays perform analog vector-matrix multiplication naturally, with each row and column of the crossbar connected through a processing element (PE) that represents a weight in a weight matrix. Inputs can be applied to the rows as voltage pulses, and the resulting column currents are scaled, or multiplied, by the PEs according to physics. The total current in a column is defined by the summation of each PE current. Given the importance of these types of calculations to optimize machine learning and AI, a need exists to further scale measurement device dimensions to provide different on-resistance values.

These weights do not vary, so the processing elements are made up of a single transistor where the weight is the transistor on-resistance.

    "ip_description": "Creation and validation of the retention time trajectory method (RTT) for describing chromatographic peaks. Includes matching between entire chromatographic trajectories rather than just peaks. Permits the use of simple statistics that do not require resource intensive training or feature extraction. Gas chromatography (GC) is utilized in analytical chemistry to separate and analyze compounds that can be vaporized without decomposition. Its most common uses include testing purity of a substance or separating out different components of a mixture. GC may be classified either as untargeted or untargeted, depending upon whether the chemical substances are known prior to analysis. In targeted analysis, the retention time of each peak reading in the GC chromatogram is compared with pre-installed values of all compounds of interest in an existing library of measurements. If the retention time of a peak matches one of the pre-installed values, then the result is reported. Conversely, if the retention time of a peak does not match any pre-installed values, then the peak is ignored or reported as interferent. Variations in physical factors such as temperature and carrier gas flow rate can cause peak drifts in a chromatogram from run to run, which can either hinder peak identification or trigger false alarms. Proper matching or alignment of chromatographic peaks across different samples can be undertaken by dividing the data into histograms and incorporating all data in a recognition profile for each measurement, though this method suffers from reduced resolution in the presence of large peak drifts. An alternative yet more costly approach involves the use of machine learning based analyses, though these approaches are most suitable for bulky mass spectrometry-based analysis rather than onsite monitoring. Given that retention time drifting is ubiquitous in chromatographic measurement and existing analytical methods are imperfect, a need exists for a less costly and more reproducible means by which to evaluate chromatographic data. Researchers have created and validated a concept called retention time trajectory (RTT) that combines and describes a series of chromatogram peaks occurring under a specific set of experimental conditions. RTT uniquely represents a chromatogram in a 2-dimensional diagram which compares the RTT obtained from the sample chromatogram with those stored in an existing library. The main features of this approach include matching between entire trajectories rather than individual peaks in the sample and reference chromatograms, the use of simple statistics that do not require resource intensive training or feature extraction, and hybridization of RTT libraries (RTTlib) to reduce costs for RTTlib generation through actual experiments. In this setting, each hybridized RTTlib is generated from two experimentally derived RTTlibs. Moving forward, a larger number of experimentally obtained RTTlibs could be involved, and the linear coefficients could be further tuned depending on the complexities of the subjects to be analyzed. Additionally, since this methodology only measures input variables at the apex positions of each peak rather than the whole peak profile or mass spectra, it can negate sensitivity to concentration or background and eliminates the need for bulky instruments such as those associated with mass spectroscopy. While the simple RTT matching approach cannot be universally applicable to all kinds of samples in a targeted analysis, it is amenable to automation with low computation costs and can be broadly applied to gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, and other spectroscopic techniques, as well as chromatogram profile aligning.",

It features a protective, exclusionary external matrix paired with a regenerative matrix facing the deficit. Chronic periodontal disease affects about 40% of adults in the United States. Regenerative periodontal surgeries are recommended in severe cases when the bone that supports the teeth has been damaged or destroyed. These surgeries frequently use artificial membranes that prevent the more rapidly growing epithelial cells from filling in the area of more slowly growing bone cells and crowding them out. The membranes must be biocompatible, non-allergenic, easy to use in the clinic, able to maintain their shape, and durable over the time frame required for bone regeneration. Unfortunately, existing membranes are not easily sutured into, they do not permit controlled dosing of growth factors, and they usually require a tradeoff in mechanical properties between rigid or elastic. As such, a need exists for membrane technologies that fulfill a more robust set of clinical requirements. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a thermosensitive membrane for regenerative periodontal surgery. The membrane is made from an interpenetrating network of poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) and allows for promotion of tissue regeneration while exhibiting a flexible structure capable of fitting any required space. The properties of the device can be modulated by warm water, progressing from rigid to more flexible with increasing temperature. Its temperature-sensitive mechanical properties foster increased flexibility for clinical handling and fitting without loss of its intrinsic nanostructure that promotes regeneration. The membrane is fabricated with a bilayer topology such that an exclusionary external matrix faces outward and provides protection while a regenerative matrix faces the defect and promotes tissue regrowth. The membrane structure can also be loaded with nanoparticles to provide controlled release of small molecules and peptides to further induce regeneration.

Best-in-class materials with superior deliverable capacities at low pressure and ambient temperature. Improved safety and range for natural gas-powered vehicles. Natural gas is an attractive gasoline alternative on account of its wide availability, established distribution network, high hydrogen to carbon ratio, and moderate carbon emissions. A long-standing challenge for its use as a transportation fuel is the fact that it is a gas under normal temperatures and pressures, which makes safe transportation and onboard vehicle storage difficult. Current solutions to natural gas storage involve liquefaction at low temperatures and compression at high pressures, both of which require complex and expensive tank designs. Adsorbed natural gas (ANG) is a promising alternative because of its ability to store natural gas at high densities at modest pressures (~35-80 bar, rather than 250 bar), which translates to less costly tank designs and greater safety. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with high porosity, high surface area, and tunability in structure have emerged as promising materials for ANG. HKUST-1 is one such MOF that is commonly cited as a benchmark methane adsorbent, given its high total methane capacity and excellent deliverable capacity. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a novel computational screening tool that is specifically optimized to identify promising MOFs for storage and delivery of methane (the primary component of natural gas). Although high uptake at elevated pressure is critical for achieving this performance, a low density of high-affinity sites also contributes to a more complete release of stored gas at low pressure. Utilizing this method, the researchers screened many thousands of known MOFs and identified the best performers. Of those identified, the researchers synthesized and experimentally verified the exceptional performance of two MOFs, which both outperform the benchmark sorbent, HKUST-1 (both volumetrically and gravimetrically), under a pressure swing of 80 to 5 bar at 298 K. Specifically, the new compounds exhibit deliverable volumetric capacities of 226 cm3/cm3 and 216 cm3/cm3 (in contrast to 200 cm3/cm3 for HKUST-1) and gravimetric capacities of 0.271 g/g and 0.377 g/g (in contrast to 0.162 g/g for HKUST-1). The observed experimental properties correlate well with the computationally predicted properties, which provides confidence that the majority of the identified MOFs are likely to be exceptional performers in ANG applications.",

The potential benefits of this approach include better spatial resolution and/or enhanced vertical resolution. The faster oscillation could also optimize other magnetometer applications, such as 'very fast fault detection', where dramatic changes in current and/or magnetic field (e.g. 100T change in a few ms) need to be more rapidly detected.",

    "ip_description": "A novel means by which to measure resonant surface waves in liquids and soft materials. Enables the rapid measurement of blood clot stiffness during formation and over time. An approach which is non-invasive and non-destructive to maximize safety. Abnormal blood clot stiffness is a critical indicator of pathologies ranging from coronary artery disease to diabetes, and it serves as a potential metric to track the effectiveness of heparin treatment following major cardiovascular surgeries. As a tissue becomes harder due to forces such as tumor formation or cirrhosis of the liver, it becomes less resistant to deformations and indicates a pathological state. Elastography is the name of the type of measurement that assesses tissue elasticity or the tendency of a tissue to resist deformation. Clinical situations such as cardiopulmonary bypass and heart transplant surgeries require dose dependent heparin anticoagulation to avoid post-surgical complications such as those caused by clot formation. The management of heparin dosing is still largely determined by activated coagulation time, a method with poor sensitivity and a lack of correlation with heparin level disparities in the postoperative setting. Clot stiffness, or clot elastic modulus (CEM), has emerged as a promising metric for hemostasis which is regulated by the availability of its constituent proteins, fibrin, platelets, and erythrocytes. Despite the usefulness of measuring clot stiffness, there are few existing devices which accurately measure and quantify changes in a clot's viscoelastic properties. Whereas multiple devices can visually measure and represent stiffness, few provide quantifiable information that can inform clinical treatment options. Given the high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, the need exists for a device that can rapidly track and quantify blood clot thickness over time for patients within the hospital and primary care centers. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a technique for the generation and tracking of resonant surface waves in liquids and soft materials. The device consists of a transducer that generates ultrasonic pulses, detects resulting oscillations, and calculates viscoelastic properties of the biomaterial. Echo waveforms are stored during the measurements and are used to calculate the displacement of the sample surface as a function of time. The device has been tested across a wide range of soft biomaterial elasticities and shows consistent readings. This analysis enables the rapid measurement of blood clot stiffness, enabling clinicians to predict the progression of cardiovascular diseases and the response to heparin treatment following cardiovascular surgeries. Currently, few options exist to monitor clot stiffness at the early stages of pathology. This approach is non-invasive and non-destructive, allowing for dynamic tracking of material properties at a variety of time scales. The current technology could enable clinicians to detect and treat blood clotting technology in its early stages.",

    "ip_description": "A non-invasive device that can detect increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Uses an ultrasound generator to produce an acoustic signal measured by an eye patch sensor. Useful in hospital settings or by first responders at motor vehicle accident sites or on battlefields. The brain is bathed in and surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which is maintained during periods of homeostasis at a specific intracranial pressure (ICP) to protect intracranial structures and optimize neurologic functioning. Increased ICP can result from several different causes and poses a clinical problem that must be managed to prevent severe brain damage or even death. Intracranial pressure changes are commonly measured invasively by implanting devices directly into the skull cavity or by lumbar puncture. The inherent limitations associated with invasive devices have fostered efforts to create non-invasive techniques to measure ICP. The anatomic \u201a\u00c4\u00fawindows\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 to the intracranial space are the eyes and ears, though efforts to reproducibly monitor ICP through these structures have not yielded successful results. While the eye is more accessible than the ear and intraocular pressure does correlate with ICP, existing efforts to measure ICP by evaluating eye pressure have shown conflicting and non-reproducible results. A need exists for a portable, non-invasive sensor for measuring ICP in casualties with traumatic head injury and hospitalized patients with a variety of clinical circumstances. Researchers have developed a method to apply acoustic energy to the head that is measured by piezoelectric film sensors in eye patches to successfully estimate intracranial pressure. In this device an ultrasonic sweep generator applies an acoustic signal across the patient's skull at a predetermined range that is dampened in a manner that correlates with ICP. The skull, brain, and eyes all act as resonant structures which transmit the sound waves. The eye patch sensors can detect the resonant frequency of sound, or the acoustic signals can be created at a range of less than 20 kHz to permit the analyzer to determine retinal artery pulsations. The eye patches are comfortable and rapidly provides readings that are sensitive, accurate, and reproducible. The device is portable and can be used in hospitals or in settings where head trauma patients are assessed by first responders, such as at the site of motor vehicle accidents or on battlefields.",

    "ip_description": "A novel thermoelectric device that converts heat waste into energy. Based upon Silicon, which is abundant and has favorable thermoelectric properties. Applications over a wide range of conventional and critical industries. The energy conversion efficiency of internal combustion engines is limited by the fundamental laws of thermodynamics to around 30%, with the bulk of the energy released from fuel combustion wasted thermally as heat. Therefore, any substantial improvement in the efficiency of fossil-fuel-powered engines requires new technologies that can harvest the wasted heat efficiently and at low costs. Most existing heat recovery systems implemented in vehicles suffer from cost-limitations that prevent large-scale deployment in consumer markets. Thermoelectric (TE) devices have been devised that rely on the thermoelectric effect to directly convert a temperature difference into electrical energy. Successful TE devices must have a high thermopower coefficient, high electrical conductivity, and low thermal conductivity. Metals have high electrical conductivity but low thermopower while semiconductors have large thermopower but low conductivity. TE materials currently of interest are often exotic composites comprised of lead, bismuth, and tellurium. The alloys are therefore difficult and expensive to manufacture in bulk. A need exists to discover a new type of thermoelectric device which is effective and affordable. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a novel method for making thermoelectric devices based on earth-abundant silicon (Si) which can be created using standard micro-electronics fabrication techniques. The invention provides a means of patterning nanostructured Si devices to optimize the thermoelectric figure of merit. By carefully embedding nanostructures on the surface of a device in the form of nanowires or nanoinclusions, the electrical and thermal properties can be tuned separately to maximize the efficiency of the device. Silicon, the material of choice in this invention report, is uniquely suited for use as a bulk thermoelectric material for waste heat recovery since it can easily be doped with p- and n-type carriers that are connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel. Applied to fossil-fuel-powered engines, this technology could substantially increase the efficiency of cars, planes, boats, and other vehicles. Other applications of this process may include computer processing chips, cooling systems, refrigerators, electric power plants, electric generators, solar cells and inverters, across multiple industries.",

These non-ionic, amphiphilic polymers form nanodiscs with both positively and negatively charged lipids. The nanodiscs demonstrate excellent stability against pH and divalent metal ions. They have been shown to directly extract and reconstitute membrane proteins, irrespective of the protein's charges, from the cell membrane without the use of any detergent.

Nanoelectronic sensors based on low dimensional materials such as graphene benefit from their extremely high surface-to-volume ratio, low power consumption, chemical robustness, and convenient electrical readout. Although direct current (DC) sensors offer the potential benefit of simpler circuitry compared to alternating current (AC) systems, nearly all existing DC chemical vapor sensing methodologies require charge transfer between the sensor surface and the adsorbed molecules being sensed. Although these systems can display high sensitivity, the high binding energies required significantly slow the response time of the sensors and render them unsuitable for the detection of non-polar analytes. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a DC-based nanoelectronic vapor sensor that is able to rapidly and sensitively detect a broad range of vapor molecules, including polar, weakly polar, and non-polar chemical compounds. The sensor incorporates a graphene field-effect transistor configuration cleverly employed and integrated with a unique microfabricated system that amplifies the DC signal response. The response and regeneration time can be as short as sub-second and the sensitivity can be at the sub-ppb level with power consumption as low as tens of microwatts. With its capability to detect a full range of analytes (polar, non-polar, weakly polar, inorganic, organic) and its excellent sensitivity and rapid regeneration, the technology is a promising detector in micro gas chromatography systems and is already compatible with many existing microGC platforms.

Five times increase in signal-to-noise ratio compared to state-of-the-art electron microscopy. An approach that can be implemented during signal recovery or even retrospectively. In fields such as materials science, medicine, and biology, there is an increasing need for imaging techniques that provide both structural and elemental composition information at nanometer and atomic scales. Advances in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) have enabled such imaging through the simultaneous use of other imaging modalities including energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and high-angle annual dark field (HAADF) techniques. Conventionally, HAADF has been analyzed separately from EDX/EELS.

The algorithm leverages correlated information encoded within HAADF and EDX/EELS imaging modalities.

Less intense electron beams may be used for sensitive samples. Images from less sophisticated instruments can be enhanced without adding additional expensive detectors.

    "ip_description": "A coating of active or anode material with nanopowders to improve battery performance. Coatings can be applied by ball milling, ultrasonic mixing, or electrospray methods. Yields enhanced energy capacities, greater stability, and improved degradation results. Nano powder coatings can enhance the performance of lithium battery components in several ways, including improved electrode performance, enhanced conductivity, increased durability, and augmented safety. Coating the electrode material with nanoscale coatings can increase the surface area of the material, which expands the contact area with the electrolyte and accelerates the rate of charge and discharge. Coating can offer mechanical properties that resist charge or discharge dimensional changes and prevent unwanted phase transitions, favoring the formation of desirable phases. Uniform and complete coating also protects battery components from degradation due to electrochemical reactions such as oxidation and reduction that can cause corrosion. Alternatively, nonuniform coating causes crack initiation that leads to coating failure as well as causing chemical pitting of substrates that progresses to corrosion. As such, a need exists for augmented processes which optimize the advantages of nanocoating for lithium batteries. Researchers have discovered that coating active or anode materials with nanopowders that are solid electrolytes or which can transform to solid electrolytes during battery operation can substantially improve the performance of the coated active material through enhanced energy capacities, or greater long-term stability. These coatings can be applied very simply by mixing using ball milling, ultrasonic mixing or electrospray coatings and despite being porous offer a wide variety of much enhanced properties. Studies have confirmed that this approach eliminates or greatly reduces degradative processes in a number of unexpected ways. While porous coatings are prone to failure because the pores themselves can promote degradation of the active materials, use of these solid nanopowders yield enhanced energy capacities, greater long-term stability, and improved or eliminated degradation. This invention will prove useful for a wide range of applications, and further refinements of the processes hold promise for ongoing functional advances.",

Utilizes metal oxide dopants to produce small nanoparticles in the final ceramic material. Creation of homogeneously sized nanoparticles allows scaling of manufacturing processes. Sodium-ion batteries are a promising alternative to lithium-ion battery technology, especially since lithium is rare and costly to mine. Sodium is abundant and inexpensive to obtain. Sodium-ion batteries also can be fully drained without damaging the component materials and offer better resilience in terms of the number of charge cycles they can undergo. However, sodium-ion batteries are limited in that they are significantly heavier than their lithium counterparts, and the manufacturing of beta alumina solid electrolytes, a critical component, creates design constraints. Beta alumina solid electrolytes are composed of Beta\"-Al2O3 and regulate the flow of sodium ions between anode and cathode in batteries during discharge and charging cycles. A need exists for manufacturing processes that create beta alumina useful for sodium-ion batteries.

    "ip_description": "Scalable process to produce pressure sensitive adhesives from superabsorbent polymers. Diverts diapers and feminine hygiene products from landfills. Produces commercial adhesives with reduced carbon emissions. Crosslinked sodium polyacrylate-based superabsorbent polymers (SAP) are used in a variety of common consumer products, including disposable personal hygiene products such as baby diapers, adult incontinence products, and feminine hygiene products. The global annual production of this superabsorbent material is estimated to be over two million metric tons, with disposable diapers claiming 74% of the market. Because SAPs are used predominately in disposable articles, a high percentage of SAPs are disposed of in landfills. Because mechanical recycling cannot be used with polymers that do not reversibly melt (e.g., crosslinked SAPs), most diaper recycling efforts have focused on the cellulosic components and ignored the SAPs. Researchers at the University of Michigan, in collaboration with a Fortune 500 consumer products company, have developed a practical method to upcycle sodium polyacrylate-based SAPs to pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs). The open-loop recycling approach involves de-crosslinking the SAP, an optional chain-shortening step, and functionalization via esterification to produce the PSA. The resulting materials exhibit low-to-medium storage and loss moduli and are structurally nearly identical to commercially available pressure-sensitive adhesives. They are suitable for use as general-purpose adhesives for products including tapes, bandages, and sticky notes. Furthermore, a life cycle analysis demonstrated that the adhesives synthesized via this approach outcompete the same materials derived from petroleum feedstocks on nearly every metric, including carbon dioxide emissions and cumulative energy demand. This potentially scalable route to recycling diapers and feminine hygiene products could keep two million metric tons of polymer waste from landfills each year and simultaneously reduce carbon emissions associated with conventional PSAs.",

Microplastics are now ubiquitous in the environment and are found in all surface water, including locations as remote as the Arctic and the deepest parts of the ocean. Microplastics have been found in various human consumables, including seafood, salt, and drinking water. While the health effects of ingesting microplastics are still being studied, there are concerns about potential risks, including inflammation, cellular damage, and the transfer of harmful chemicals. While efforts to remove large plastic items from the environment have been ongoing, comparatively little has been done to address microplastics pollution. So, a need exists for new technologies that help to mitigate the presence of microplastics in the environment. Researchers at the University of Michigan have identified adhesives that remove microplastics from aqueous solutions. Surfaces coated with the adhesive have been shown to rapidly adhere microplastics suspended in water upon contact. Insertion of an adhesive-coated object into the solution followed by extraction presents a successful approach to concentrating and removing microparticles from the solution. The adhesives have been shown to work with a variety of microplastics, including polystyrene, nylon, and rubber. As an additional environmental benefit, the adhesive used for microplastics removal may be produced using an open-loop recycling process that converts waste super-absorbent polymers into pressure sensitive adhesives.

The test may be completed quickly to guide treatment for patients with acute conditions. Platelets play a pivotal role in normal hemostasis, and abnormally high platelet functioning can cause coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or peripheral vascular occlusive disease (PVOD). While patients may inherit a disposition for abnormal clotting, platelet dysfunction may result from circumstances such as sepsis, malignancies, extra-corporeal circulation, the presence of prosthetic heart valves, or dialysis. Alternatively, abnormally low platelet levels or functioning correlate with uncontrolled bleeding and an inability to safely undergo surgery. The causes of thrombocytopenia may include primary bone marrow insufficiency due to hematologic malignancies or secondary dysfunction caused by delivery of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Perhaps the most common causes for decreased platelet functioning results from the iatrogenic effects of antiplatelet drugs prescribed for the treatment of CAD, CVA and PVOD. Given the complex nature of clotting, a need exists for a simple, quantitative measure of platelet function to guide clinicians who treat these conditions. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a self-signaling polydiacetylene (PDA) liposome microarray to detect activated platelets from whole blood samples in a single step. The inventors employ an antibody called 9F9 which is specific to platelet-bound fibrinogen and that conjugates with the polydiacetylene (PDA) liposome microarray to generate an intense fluorescence signal when contacted with activated platelets in whole blood. The PDA liposome assay allows for evaluation of samples without the need for complex blood cell separation equipment or additional in vitro platelet stimulation with exogenous agonists such as collagen. Testing reveals that the microarray successfully quantifies the degree of reduced platelet activation induced by the presence of varying amounts of Tirofiban, a model antiplatelet drug. This approach is also sensitive enough to assess reduced platelet function of patients on low dose aspirin or on antiplatelet drugs. The bench-top assay requires 20 minutes or less to complete and can therefore efficiently direct therapy for patients with acute presentations of angina pectoris or stroke. Further uses of the technology include identifying patients with bleeding disorders, monitoring responses to antiplatelet treatments, evaluating perioperative hemostasis, and guiding transfusion medicine.",

Accounts for the heterogeneity of individual spent automotive batteries. Repurposing automotive batteries may have environmental and economic benefits. Extending the useful life of batteries can reduce waste and environmental pollution, while also decreasing the demand for new batteries and the environmental pollution that accompanies their production. Furthermore, repurposed automotive batteries may still hold a significant amount of energy after their usefulness in vehicles is done, yielding cost-effectiveness for their utilization in other settings. The challenge with second-use batteries centers on the uncertainty and diversity of the expected packs in terms of their chemistry, capacity and remaining useful life.

Battery utilization is maximized by evaluating data regarding supply heterogeneity, testing accuracy, and aging or degradation to choose power converter ratings and power connectivity within 2-BESS. This results in higher battery utilization in capacity and power, while using lower power converters, at high heterogeneity. For example, the methodology provides greater than 90% battery utilization at 15% power or capacity heterogeneity with better than 1/6th in power converter cost compared to the best competing technology.

It is also critical to be able to achieve good quality ohmic contacts with these materials to form a junction that provides current conduction from metal to semiconductor and vice versa. This goal is commonly achieved using wide bandgap materials such as gallium nitride (GaN) and gallium oxide (Ga2O3). Aluminum-alloyed gallium oxide (AlxGa2-xO3) is an attractive alternative to these wide bandgap materials because it has an even wider bandgap and hence, higher breakdown field. However, similar approaches of ion-implantation doping and ohmic contact formation for AlxGa2-xO3 have not yet been realized. The demand for high-power applications such as electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and grid infrastructure highlights the need for improved methods for forming Ohmic contact on AlxGa2-xO3. Researchers have devised a method for doping Aluminum-alloyed gallium oxide (AlxGa2-xO3) to form ohmic contact with contact resistance. The method for doping Al-alloyed gallium oxide (AlxGa2-xO3) achieves n-type conductivity by introducing donor impurities into the material.

    "ip_description": "A built-in optical system with algorithms to make secure digital still images and videos. Utilizes transparent detector planes to create focal focal-stack images. Offers improved forgery detection that applies to various media types. While digital images are convenient for users because they are easy to take, store, and share, they are also susceptible to malicious manipulation. Advancements in deep learning has led to relatively easy reconfigurations of images and videos into high fidelity fakes. Methodologies for these manipulations include splicing new objects into the content, removing objects which were originally present in the image, and replacing one face with another. Faked images have been utilized to promote inaccurate news with the goals of fostering financial hoaxes or political propaganda. Altered images have even been submitted as pieces of evidence in criminal investigations. Existing methods which are employed in an effort to prevent malicious image manipulation all function by influencing the software processing of an image after it has been obtained. In what is considered to be an active approach to dealing with this issue, semi-fragile watermarks are embedded in an image and are eliminated by malicious editing. The watermarking approach is robust is particularly effective in detecting resizing of an image, though it also alters the original content by its presence. A passive approach that is simple to implement relies on the use of imaging artifacts caused by lens distortion, color filtering, photo response non-uniformity (PRNU), and compression to perceive changes. The passive approach is limited because of its reliance on weak traces that are likely to be destroyed after compression or resizing of an image. So, despite existing machine learning algorithms used to detect image manipulation, a need remains for security systems built into the hardware of the camera that could facilitate forgery detection and prevention. Researchers have created a technology which combines a built-in optical system with algorithms to make secure digital still images and videos. The camera is modified by placing one or multiple transparent detector planes stacked along the optical axis between the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) chip and the lens of a camera. This system is therefore capable of capturing focal-stack images, at varying depths of a scene. The methodology of this approach therefore includes intake of a stack of images for a given scene, each of which is captured at a different focal plane by an imaging device. The stack of images can then be measured for self-consistency, which can then designate the existing image as authentic. Those images that are not self-consistent would be deemed manipulated. The innovation effectively makes it laborious to defocus blur signature across the focal stack, thereby dissuading those who would wish to tamper and forge the images.

    "ip_description": "An optical scratch pad to detect and mitigate ICs. Provides a memory which is self-destructible. Responds to light or temperature changes. Counterfeit integrated circuits (IC) are a concern in the electronics industry because their inferior quality, reliability, and performance can cause equipment failure. System malfunctions due to IC can lead to safety hazards across important computer platforms utilized in the aerospace, defense, and medical equipment industries. Manufacturer attempts to prevent counterfeited technologies are multifactorial and include strengthening intellectual property laws, optimizing supply chain traceability, and utilizing technical approaches that set standards for device testing and certification. Existing technological approaches involve the imbedding of security features within the IC devices themselves. Examples of these features include tamper-evident packaging, holographic labels, and unique identification codes. Additionally, testing and verification methods may include X-ray analysis, infrared imaging, and electrical testing. Still, a need exists for improved ways to validate an IC and determine whether it has been counterfeited, ensuring the safety and reliability of electronic devices. Researchers have invented an approach that utilizes nanoscale strain engineering to create a self-erasable and rewritable platform for anti-tamper hardware. The inventors created a material consisting of a monolayer of WSe2 (a transition metal dichalcogenide) layered on top of layers of azobenzene (A3) molecules. The reversible structural change between trans and cis isomers in azobenzene (A3) molecules is used to strain the overlying tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayer, thereby affecting its optical bandgap. Using such hybrid material combinations, the innovators generated large (>1%) local strain that resulted in a dramatic shift (> 11 nm) in photoluminescence wavelength. The strain in layered A3 films can be rapidly relaxed under exposure to visible light or can be retained up to seven days under dark conditions. By utilizing hyperspectral imaging, the technology demonstrates a self-erasable and rewritable optoexcitonic platform that responds to environmental changes, such as those related to light or temperature, to detect tampering of the hardware system. In addition, the results open avenues for varied applications in information storage, time sensitive self-destructive memories to light detection. In short, this technology is a device that responds to the environmental conditions of light and heat in the form of photoluminescence, with the degree of photoluminescing being able to be controlled by layering of A3 molecules and with the technology being able to self-erase due to relaxation or white light exposure.",

These devices allow for thinner metasurface devices with greater control and precision than existing devices. They can be broadband, multiband, or multifunctional and reflective or transmissive. Metasurfaces are artificial surfaces which manipulate the propagation of electromagnetic waves for applications involving communications, aerospace engineering, and manufacturing. One of the most promising applications of metasurfaces involves the development of polarization control devices, which can efficiently and precisely manipulate the polarization state of light or radio waves. They can therefore be used to improve the quality and reliability of wireless communication systems by enabling better control over signal polarization, reducing interference and signal degradation. In aerospace settings, metasurfaces can be used to design and optimize radar systems for detecting objects in variable weather conditions. In manufacturing, they can be utilized to produce high-quality, precisely calibrated optical components. Still, while state-of-the-art polarization devices utilize stacked birefringent plates or subwavelength grating dimensions to produce high quality photonics devices, these approaches are hindered by sharp spectral resonance peaks, and tend to be lossy. So, a need exists for improvements in metasurface technology that minimize the formation of spectral resonance peaks. Researchers have created a class of polarization control devices that consist of multiple stacked dielectric gratings which allow a thinner metasurface devices with greater control and precision than existing devices. The inventors have created methods and computer software to efficiently and accurately compute the response of layered grating structures at arbitrary incidence angles, taking multiple reflections into account. These advancements allow for rapid synthesis of new devices through numeric optimization techniques which can be applied to multiple manufacturing methods and corresponding frequency ranges. The grating period in each layer is much smaller than the wavelength of light, so that the layer can be regarded as effectively a homogeneous, anisotropic medium. By adjusting the grating materials, filling fraction, thickness, and orientation for each layer, a variety of useful polarization control devices can be realized. The devices can be broadband (operating over a wide frequency range), multiband (operating over several distinct frequency ranges), or multifunctional (providing different polarization responses over different frequency ranges). Furthermore, the devices can operate in reflection or transmission. The improved methodologies can be applied to a variety of situations including three-dimensional printing, ceramic stereolithography, and the creation of dry-etched silicon wafers.",

Useful for mobile devices, transportation, and the internet of things. The overwhelming demand for higher data rate, bandwidth and capacity has been driving the transition from the current 4G mobile communication to the 5th generation (5G). In order to facilitate the transition into 5G, advances in antenna technology are required to improve inadequate signals and poor bandwidth. Millimeter wave antennas have therefore become crucial components in 5G mobile systems since they enable the high-speed data transmission necessary for next-generation wireless communication. Antennas that operate in the millimeter wave frequency range provide a larger bandwidth for data transfer than the lower frequencies used in previous cellular systems. The capabilities of these new antennas enable functionalities such as augmented and virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities.

The air bridge resides between a semiconductor thin film device and a reflector, leading to a > 99% reflectance in the spectra range of interests. Light management is critical to maximize open circuit voltage for many optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaic (PV) cells, thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells, photodetectors (PD), light-emitting diodes (LEDs), etc. Thin film devices with high quality back reflectors often show superior properties over conventional bulk substrate devices in this setting. For example, high reflectance mirror targeting at the bandgap energy of a PV cell enhances the photon-recycling effect, leading to a substantial increase in the open circuit voltage. A high-quality mirror that improves the sub-bandgap reflectance in a thin film TPV cell may lead to significant improvement in its overall power conversion efficiency. However, current approaches for optimizing light management such as the use of metal mirrors, photonic crystals, and metamaterials, are usually limited in their effectiveness since they commonly create less than 95% of reflectance in the spectra range of interests.

    "ip_description": "A method for sparse power processing with dynamic configurability for heterogeneous energy storage systems. Improves power conversion efficiency through the use of differential power converters. Provides 98% power conversion efficiency while requiring fewer converters per battery. Heterogeneous energy storage systems combine multiple types of energy storage devices to achieve optimal performance and efficiency. These systems can include batteries, supercapacitors, and other energy storage technologies, each with their unique characteristics, such as energy density, power density, and cycle life. By combining these different energy storage technologies, heterogeneous energy storage systems can provide a high level of flexibility, allowing them to address different energy storage requirements and applications. Additionally, these devices can reduce the overall cost of energy storage by combining lower-cost, higher-power storage devices with higher-cost, higher-energy density devices. As the demand for renewable energy sources continues to grow, heterogeneous energy storage systems have become increasingly important, as they can help to address the intermittency and variability of renewable energy sources, improve grid stability, and reduce carbon emissions. However, heterogeneous systems pose several implementation challenges compared to ones in which only a single type of battery is used. Oftentimes, existing control techniques which charge and discharge different batteries cannot account for electrochemical or mechanical differences between them, so a need exists for new technologies to overcome these challenges. Researchers from the University of Michigan have developed a method for sparse power processing with dynamic configurability for heterogeneous energy storage systems. This technology improves power conversion efficiency through the use of differential power converters, given that it can intelligently adapt to the characteristics of different types of energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors. The interconnection is dynamically configurable to obtain the optimum arrangement of converters, resulting in a sparse topology that only activates the necessary components for a specific application. Within this context, differential power processing (DPP) is an energy conversion architecture that overcomes current mismatch from different batteries, thereby increasing power conversion efficiency and system reliability. The sparse topology and the differential power processing help reduce the number of converters needed and improve power conversion efficiency, respectively. The inventors demonstrate a power conversion efficiency of approximately 98%, and the number of converters required is fewer than the number of batteries, improving system optimization. The invention can also be applied to the growing market of energy storage systems built with used (second-life) electric vehicle batteries.

Applications include car charging, industrial electrical equipment, low-power light fixtures, and wearable devices. Electronic devices increasingly permeate consumer markets, though the downtime and interference required by recharging these devices continue to limit their efficiency of use. Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to favorably transform the way that machines and devices are powered. This approach involves the transfer of electrical energy from one device to another without the need for physical connections, such as cords or cables. Existing WPT technologies are used for charging of smartphones, tablets, and wearables, as well as the powering medical implants and charging electric vehicles. This technology offers many benefits, such as increased convenience, improved safety, and reduced clutter, making it an essential component of the future of power delivery.

Compared to existing technologies which are incapable of charging a small number of devices at the same time, this innovation permits multi access (MA) charging of hundreds of them. The process achieves MA WPT by implementing code division multiplexing (CDM) which functions by creating orthogonal codes to maintain separation between devices.

Produces Molybdenum disulfide lines for transistors and memristors. The process for producing semiconductor integrated circuits and microchips is complex and requires incredible precision and uniformity to ensure high yields. Sensitivity to potential contaminants dictates that they be produced in clean room settings. Emerging low-dimensional nanomaterials, such as 2D materials, have provided new opportunities in making electronic and optoelectronic devices. To manufacture commercially viable devices/systems based on such nanomaterials, conventional resist-based lithography and plasma-based etching processes need to be performed to pattern the raw material films into orderly arranged device patterns. Such conventional patterning processes can inevitably introduce serious contamination and damage to the patterned materials and therefore result in inconsistent electronic properties. So, a need exists for a process for producing circuits and microchips while minimizing damage to the atomically-thin structures of nanomaterials. Researchers have invented an approach capable of directly generating device patterns of nanomaterials without additional resist-based lithography and etching processes. The methodology consists of two steps, the first of which involves a damage-free rubbing process for generating triboelectric charge patterns on a dielectric surface, while the second consists of site-selective chemical vapor deposition of target nanomaterials within rubbing-induced charge patterns.

Improved signal-to-noise at 1 millionth the light intensity of other two photon systems. Two photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) is a spectroscopy technique that utilizes long wavelength light (usually near infrared, NIR) to generate a fluorescence signal, usually from biological materials. TPEF requires two photons to be absorbed nearly simultaneously for every one photon emitted as the fluorescence signal. Traditional approaches have relied upon the use of high intensity lasers in order to generate a fluorescence signal strong enough to be detected. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed an approach to TPEF that utilizes quantum entangled two photon absorption (ETPA). This technique represents the first ever demonstration of ETPA spectroscopy using type-I degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) pumped by a continuous wave (CW) laser to yield fluorescence from an organic chromophore. The system also uses a spatial light modulator to tune the excited state population, and the design lends itself to the development of a turnkey, all-in-a-box, benchtop spectrometer that can be operated by trained laboratory personnel who are not laser spectroscopy specialists. The use of a CW-pumped laser, rather than ultrafast pulsed lasers, reduces the size, weight, complexity, and cost of the system. This novel quantum spectrometer utilizes a CW photon flux that is a million times smaller than conventional TPEF. The reduced light intensity enables the use of fluorophores prone to photobleaching and also dramatically increases the sensitivity and detection limit of the instrument.

These systems are essential tools for neuroscientists, clinicians, and researchers studying brain function, neural circuits, and neurological disorders. Current state-of-the-art neural recording systems provide just 100-300 parallel channels and many of them use rigid silicone-based probes, which result in tissue damage. There is now a growing body of research on flexible probe geometries both from academia and early-stage startups to enable long-term, neural recordings. But, even with flexible probes, front-end Integrated Circuits (ICs) remains highly dependent on Si-based CMOS technology. This requires hybrid integration techniques for the interconnection between the probes and front-end ICs.

There is therefore a critical need for flexible, biocompatible probes that are both compact and provide a high channel-count to enable large-scale in vivo neural recordings.

Solar receivers utilizing this material generate 700 degrees Celsius at low concentration ratio. Increases efficiency of CST system by 6-10% at nominal extra cost, reduces LCOE by 25-35%. The market for concentrated solar thermal (CST) technologies in 2018 was $5.5 billion and expected to grow at CAGR of 38% through 2023. To be truly competitive with coal and natural gas energy sources, next-generation CST plants are required that will utilize enhanced solar receivers to reach even higher temperatures (> 600 degrees Celsius) for efficient generation of carbon-neutral electricity or to provide high-temperature industrial process heat. Such elevated temperatures are desirable for CST plants because they may enable the use of supercritical CO2 power cycles that have higher thermodynamic efficiency than the current steam cycles. Moreover, up to 53% of industrial process heating requires temperatures over 600 degrees Celsius. Together, these two demands account for over 45% of our current energy use. To reach temperatures above 600 degrees Celsius, solar receivers must absorb solar irradiation while losing minimal amounts of heat energy as infrared radiation. Silica aerogels have been explored previously for use as a thermal insulators in solar receivers. However, at these elevated temperatures silica aerogels are insufficient as they become less insulating and less stable. Technology developed at the University of Michigan uses a special deposition process to create a multicomponent silica aerogel that is transparent to solar radiation (>93%), is thermally stable at 700 degrees Celsius, and exhibits suppressed radiative heat loss compared to conventional silica aerogels. Solar receivers utilizing this material generate 700 degrees Celsius at low solar concentration ratio (< 90x) and with a collection efficiency exceeding 64%. Because the increased efficiency comes at nominal extra cost, this technology has been projected to decrease the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by 25-35%. The high operating temperature of this multicomponent silica aerogel enables the use of alternative heat transport fluids such as supercritical CO2, which may further increase the efficiency of the solar thermal plant. Additionally, the material does not require the vacuum environment that traditional receivers do. Being able to operate under nitrogen or even air increases the life span of the receiver and decreases the maintenance required, which significantly reduces the lifetime cost of the solar installation. The technology is best suited for use in moderate intensity solar thermal systems, meaning those that concentrate to 3-80 suns. Examples are line-focused systems, such as parabolic trough designs. The insulator material could potentially also have application in high performance insulation and window materials.",

Preliminary testing suggests that this method might be effective at killing COVID-19. Efficient 10-minute sanitizing process. Ultraviolet (UV) light is emerging as a common method for disinfecting surfaces and various high touch objects. A number of UV wands, cabinets, and other lighting systems designed to sterilize objects currently exist on the market. These include inexpensive consumer cabinets that sterilize small items used in the home, such as cell phones, keys, and small toys, as well as larger, more expensive industrial grade units that sterilize medical equipment. However, there is a gap in the market for economical, mid-sized sanitizing units that can disinfect high-touch objects in high traffic settings such as workshops, schools, libraries, and labs. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a sanitizing drawer that employs UV-C light to thoroughly and effectively kill viruses and other microbes on small to mid-sized tools and other high-touch objects. The drawer is lined with a satin-finished aluminum to ensure even light distribution, as well as a sanitizing timer to ensure appropriate exposure. Furthermore, the drawer is properly sealed to ensure no harmful light escapes. The sanitizing drawer can be manufactured at a price point well below other similar industrial-grade units that are currently being used in healthcare settings. Initial testing with UV-C cure strips indicates effective germicidal irradiation and suggests possible effectiveness at killing COVID-19. Additional microbiological testing is underway.",

    "ip_description": "Preparation of 4-[18F]-MHPG isotope for PET scanning of the heart or adrenergic tumors. Provides favorable evaluation of myocardial kinetic endpoints such as left ventricle uptake. Preferential uptake in sympathetic neurons with a long retention time. Coronary heart disease (CAD) affects over 80 million adults and is the leading cause of death in the United States. A variety of diagnostic imaging procedures are used to evaluate for heart disease, including those which visualize blood flow patterns to the heart walls to diagnose disease as well as ones which evaluate functioning in the setting of known CAD. Cardiac nuclear medicine studies such as positron emission tomography (PET) scanning use radiolabeled agents to diagnose CAD, assess muscle damage after an MI, and to predict the benefit of a given intervention. PET scanning is considered biomedical imaging since it quantifies biological processes at the subcellular level and can therefore detect abnormalities before manifestation of gross anatomical features or physiological consequences. Though a variety of radiolabeled agents may be used in cardiac PET scanning, a need exists for new approaches that utilize lower concentrations of isotopes and that exhibit strong and temporally durable delineation of the heart compared to non-targeted organs. Researchers have developed two methods for preparation of fluorine-18 labeled phenethylguanidines for use as positron emission tomography (PET) contrast agent to both evaluate cardiac kinetics and to assess tumors of the sympathetic nervous system. Both methods employ a 18F-labeling step followed by one or two simple steps to yield high quantities of the final radiolabeled product, specifically 4-[18F] fluoro-meta-hydroxy phenethylguanidine (4-[18F]-MHPG). The inventors analyzed the myocardial kinetics of 4-[18F]-MHPG using the established Patlak graphical analysis which utilizes metabolite-corrected plasma input functions. The scientists established in a rat heart model that 4-[18F]-MHPG is taken up by sympathetic neurons and shows a long retention time that improves kinetic modeling of myocardial kinetics compared to existing agents. A series of microPET imaging studies performed in rhesus macaque monkeys revealed uptake consistent with uniform innervation of the left ventricle with correspondingly low uptake in the lungs and liver. Imaging analysis of the monkey following administration of a blocking dose of a norepinephrine transporter inhibitor confirmed that presynaptic sympathetic nerve terminals are the main locus of retention for 4-[18F]-MHPG in the heart. The researchers also examined the uptake of 4-[18F]-MHPG by the adrenal gland and were able to measure kinetics that proved to be very similar to those seen in the heart, suggesting that this agent can be used for oncology applications in the clinic. This novel methodology therefore provides improved imaging through the use of 4-[18F]-MHPG in both the cardiac and oncologic clinical settings.",

    "ip_description": "A microwatt resolution calorimeter for the analysis of nanomaterials. Permits the means for stable, sensitive calorimetry at high temperature and pressure. Useful for probing catalysis, phase transformations, and thermochemical energy storage. Calorimetry is a powerful technique used to study reactions involving nanomaterials, providing valuable insights into their thermodynamic properties, reaction kinetics, and stability. Calorimetry measures the heat flow associated with a chemical reaction or physical process. Calorimetry of reactions involving nanomaterials is of great current interest, but requires high-resolution heat flow measurements and long-term thermal stability. Such studies are especially challenging at elevated reaction pressures and temperatures. Calorimetric reactors enable direct measurement of reaction thermodynamics and kinetics but conventional calorimeters are generally inadequate for the analysis of milligram-scale samples at elevated temperature and pressure. As such, a need exists for improved methods for studying the reaction thermodynamics of nanomaterials. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a new type calorimetry instrument capable of measuring thermodynamics of milligram amounts of material on the microwatt scale. This instrument can resolve the net change in the amount of gas-phase reactants due to surface reactions in an operating range from room temperature to 300 \u00b0C and reaction pressures of 10 mbar to 30 bar. This instrument enables high heat flow resolution for measuring the enthalpy of reactions between gas-phase reactants and milligram scale nanomaterial samples. The calorimetric resolution is shown to be <3 \u03bcW/\u221aHz, with a long-term stability <4 \u03bcW/hour. The performance of the instrument is demonstrated via a set of experiments involving H2 absorption on Pd nanoparticles at various pressures and temperatures. For this specific reaction, we obtained a mass balance resolution of 0.1 \u03bcmol/\u221aHz. Results from these experiments are in good agreement with past studies establishing the feasibility of performing high resolution calorimetry on milligram scale nanomaterials, which can be employed in future studies probing catalysis, phase transformations, and thermochemical energy storage.",

    "ip_description": "An immersion precipitation technology that permits improved control over the porosity of printed parts. Faster printing of a wide variety of polymers with greater porosity control. Direct additive manufacturing of piezoelectric PVDF without any post-processing. Additive manufacturing allows for the fabrication of complex structures which are hard to achieve through conventional machining, extrusion, injection molding or blow molding processes. However, current additive manufacturing methods for polymers still have limitations on the types of polymers that can be 3D printed. A recent innovation in the field is immersion precipitation printing (IPP), which utilizes a solvent reservoir to precipitate the polymer out of the ink. In IPP, a polymer solution is extruded or deposited into a coagulation bath containing a non-solvent, which is miscible with the polymer solvent but does not dissolve the polymer itself. As the polymer solution comes into contact with the non-solvent, the solvent diffuses out, and the polymer precipitates out of the solution, leading to the formation of a solid structure. A need exists for a means to better define the qualities of IPP printed polymers. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a new immersion precipitation technology that affords greater control over the porosity of the printed parts. Furthermore, they have expanded the approach to polymers that are otherwise difficult to 3D print: poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)-PVDF nanocomposites. Uniquely, the technique prints high beta-phase PVDF that displays piezoelectric behavior without requiring drawing/elongation. The versatility of the technique has been successfully demonstrated by printing a variety of representative structures, ranging from fully functioning 1-way check valves (e.g. artificial hearts), LED pedestal electrodes, and strain gauges. The technology is capable of printing complex geometric shapes with a comparable size and speed of conventional material extrusion approaches. It is also able to print micro-scale structures with greater than 100 micron resolution.",

Useful beyond microscopy to settings involving a beam of quantum entangled photons. Two photon excitation microscopy (TPEF) is an imaging technique that utilizes long wavelength light (usually near infrared, NIR) to generate a fluorescence signal, usually from biological tissue. TPEF can be superior to confocal microscopies due to the greater tissue penetration (~1 mm), efficient light detection, and reduced photobleaching. Unfortunately, TPEF requires two photons to be absorbed nearly simultaneously for every one photon emitted as the fluorescence signal. Traditional approaches have relied upon the use of high intensity lasers in order to generate a fluorescence signal strong enough to detect. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a new approach to TPEF that utilizes quantum entangled two photon absorption (ETPA). This quantum microscope generates entangled photon pairs with high efficiency and also tunes certain parameters of the photon pair to match the specific fluorophore in order to maximize absorption. The quantum microscope requires an IR photon flux that is a million times smaller than conventional TPEF, enabling the use of fluorophores prone to photobleaching while also increasing the sensitivity and detection limit of the instrument. Signal-to-noise (SNR) and spatial resolution are also improved with this method. This quantum microscope therefore permits measurement and visualization of molecular, biological, and nanoparticulate compounds. Many of the technical advancements of this microscope relate to the generation of the beam of entangled photons. As such, this technology may be useful beyond microscopy to include applications requiring a beam of quantum entangled photons.",

Can also be used to evaluate patients for stroke, heart failure, or diabetes. Blood pressure (BP) is a key physiological indicator of health, with hypertension serving as a major risk factor for various medical conditions. To date, there is only one clinically validated cuff-less technique to measure BP. Existing techniques that continuously measure blood pressure employ the principle of pulse wave velocity which tracks the speed by which blood travels through the arteries. These cuffless BP techniques suffer from multiple shortcomings including the requirement for two sensors on different locations of the body to measure the pulse travel time, the need to be frequently re-calibrated at least every few hours, and the reliance on inaccurate assumptions about certain physiological factors. As such, the need exists for a device that addresses these shortcomings and provides a practical tool to measure BP accurately, continuously and conveniently. Researchers at the University of Michigan have invented a non-invasive sensor that uses analytical algorithms to continuously monitor BP in both healthy and disease patient populations. The sensor is small, inexpensive and low-power. The device wraps around the finger like a ring and generates a waveform that is rich in information about the cardiovascular system, including BP, vascular resistance, and cardiac output. The ring sensor therefore enables on-demand or continuous monitoring that could also impact conditions including stroke, heart failure, and diabetes.

Devices that interact with the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are designed to either monitor or modulate neural activity in the peripheral nerves. These devices have various applications in medicine, neuroscience research, and bioengineering. Application of these devices range from control of robotic prostheses in cases of amputation to stimulation of autonomic nerves to regulate bladder control in cases of spinal cord injury. Current conventional nerve interfaces consist of silicone shanks that penetrate the nerve and cause considerable damage or cuff electrodes that wrap around the outside, causing less damage but also recording less discrete nerve signals. Recent work in the field has shown that recording inside the nerve produces the best signal, and that smaller electrodes produce less damage. There is a pressing need to create long lasting, minimally damaging devices that interface with the peripheral nervous system. Researchers have invented a carbon fiber technology that improves peripheral nerve recording and stimulation. The device consists of carbon fibers embedded within and extending beyond a piece of silicone guard. The silicone backing increases the already known flexibility of carbon fibers to the point where the fibers can withstand a 90 degree bend at the interface junction with the silicone. Each carbon fiber protrudes from the silicone by roughly 100um-500um in equally spaced increments. This innovation allows the ability of the approach to be expanded to large scale arrays with many fibers. In addition, carbon fiber length can be varied to evaluate nerves of different diameters, with an insertion technique that creates minimal handling damage to the nerve during surgery. This new carbon fiber technology, in combination with surgical implantation technique, allows for minimally invasive monitoring and stimulation of peripheral nerves.",

Functions at a large range up to mm-wave frequencies designated for 5G data transfer. In today's wireless devices, the number of band-select radio frequency filters has exceeded fifty, which is a testament to the complexity and sophistication of modern wireless technology. These filters play a crucial role in allowing mobile devices to achieve high data throughput without being affected by interference from the crowded electromagnetic spectrum. With an increasing array of wireless devices and technologies competing for bandwidth, these filters have become essential to ensure that wireless signals can be transmitted and received without interference. The filters work by selectively filtering out unwanted signals from the surrounding environment, leaving only the desired signals to pass through. As a result, mobile devices can maintain reliable and high-speed wireless connections even in densely populated areas. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) and bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters based on piezoelectric materials are the primary technologies used for selecting the frequency of operation in communication systems, including mobile phones. With the introduction of 5G technologies, multiple millimeter (mm) wave frequency bands up to 30 GHz have been designated for very high data rate communications. However, the operation frequency of the current BAW and SAW filters is limited to sub 6 GHz frequency bands, and they can barely meet the performance requirements for wireless bands even at 5.8 GHz. As such, a need exists for a method to improve existing acoustic filtering capabilities. Researchers have invented a technology which exceeds existing acoustic filtering capabilities by alternating piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials between metal electrodes. The induction of negative piezoelectricity in specific layers activates a device resonance frequency and is intrinsically switchable, eliminating the need for external switchplexers commonly used in cell phones. The resonance frequency is dictated by layer thickness, not number of layers. So, filters using this technology will likely be easier to manufacture and may have more granular filter ranges than previously available. This technology overcomes the fundamental limit of the acoustic resonator's ever-decreasing electromechanical coupling factors (kt2) as their frequency of operation increases. The resulting Kt2 is independent of frequency, extending the operation frequency from ~6GHz to 26GHz, which is essential for 5G networks. The innovators have therefore created filtering capabilities that can function at a large frequency range up to mm-wave frequencies designated for 5G, providing solutions for efficient spectrum access at frequency bands for the current and future communication systems.",

Sensory experiences designed to confront critical challenges of learning and social engagement. Sensory surface textiles are tailored for gradations of touch to prompt a variety of responses. The CDC estimates that the Autism incidence rate in children has increased from 1:68 to 1:59 in just the past two years. Several factors contribute to the reported incidence of autism, including changes in diagnostic criteria, increased awareness and recognition of ASD, improved screening and diagnostic practices, and potential environmental and genetic factors. Functionally, up to 95% of kids with autism experience sensory modulation comorbidities. A critical part of social behavior is the ability to process, to perform and interpret a vast repertoire of motor actions, and the restriction in selection of movement skills means fewer opportunities for social interaction and ultimately degraded social outcomes in affected youth. As such, a need exists for improved methods to manage the manifestations of autism in children.

Applies to dietary supplements, pharmaceuticals, and antibiotics to prevent biofilm formation. Cysteine, an amino acid, is often lacking in individuals during infancy, advanced age, or with metabolic diseases, making supplementation necessary. Traditional cysteine purification methods like the hydrolysis of human hair and bird feathers involve extensive use of hydrochloric acid, creating significant hazardous waste and yielding low outputs, especially from bird feathers. Moreover, these methods are unsuitable for those seeking non-animal derived cysteine sources. Existing fermentation technologies utilizing genetically engineered Escherichia coli for cysteine production are more sustainable but still limited in efficiency. Therefore, a need exists for an improved method to efficiently isolate cysteine in a manner that is easily sustained and acceptable to all dietary preferences. Researchers at the University of Michigan have identified a previously unknown gene in Escherichia coli that regulates cysteine synthesis. By deleting this gene, they can significantly enhance cysteine production, making it ideal for industrial use. This method not only boosts yields but also mitigates environmental concerns related to hazardous waste from traditional hydrolysis methods.

Fungicides are used primarily to protect plants from fungal pathogens that cause diseases such as rusts, mildews, blights, and rots. By controlling these diseases, fungicides help to secure crop yields, protect food quality, and improve the economic stability of farming operations. The importance of this protection is critical to the agricultural economy, with fungicides accounting for more than twenty-two percent of the entire global pesticide market.

While WPT also offers benefits such as increased convenience, improved safety, and reduced clutter, its use is still limited because transmission is inefficient at very high frequencies.

The use of solar panels to capture sunlight and produce solar energy has become increasingly common worldwide, and methodologies to manufacture more efficient solar products are ongoing. Solar panels are constructed using semiconductor materials which convert sunlight into electricity, though inconsistent sunlight creates challenges to photovoltaic (PV) systems. Existing systems attempt to extract the greatest available power from PV modules by causing them to operate at the most efficient voltage, essentially seeking what is known as maximum power point tracking (MPPT). While MPPT can optimize power transfer from captured sunlight to electrical load, partial shading creates difficulties in achieving this goal. Even as little as 10% shading of PV receptors can result in 30% total power loss. Therefore, a need exists to create innovative approaches that optimize solar efficiency during the commonly experienced conditions of partial shading. Researchers have invented a technology that provides the architecture of a two-port converter which is capable of equalizing voltages over solar panels under partial shading. This innovation involves the use of diffusion charge redistribution (DCR) technique to utilize the intrinsic diffusion capacitance of solar cells together with semiconductor switches to balance voltage among the cells. The approach helps to overcome challenges to maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in solar photovoltaic systems when solar modules do not receive uniform solar irradiance. A differential DCR (dDCR) structure modifies the DCR architecture to enable complete differential power processing, leading to lower insertion loss because only the mismatch power is processed by every switch. The device utilizes a two-port up/down converter required by the dDCR architecture, thereby creating the capability of doing two-dimensional MPPT of dDCR solar panels.

DVS is important for supporting efficient operation of systems with rapidly fluctuating power demand, such as LiDAR systems used for autonomous ground and airborne vehicles. LiDAR systems require precise measurements of distance and speed to direct autonomous navigation, and they consume a significant amount of power. The ability of DVS to enable LiDAR systems to operate efficiently may be challenging in boost converters, which are commonly utilized to power LiDAR systems due to their more complicated dynamics.

Full duplex wireless communication involves sending and receiving wireless signals at the same time and over the same frequency band. Using this approach, the current time-division duplex and frequency-division duplex transceivers can be replaced with full-duplex transceivers which can transmit and receive data over the same frequency band simultaneously, effectively doubling the channel capacity. This increase would prove important since the number of connected devices has multiplied exponentially because technologies such as the internet of things (IoT) have saturated the available channels within a frequency band. So, a need exists for newer methods to enhance channel capacity and permit continued growth of wireless communications. Researchers have invented a technology that improves antenna design and provides a high cancellation of self-interference which facilitates full duplex wireless communication. The advance is achieved through the formation of a novel geometry of a cavity-backed slot antenna which allows for better isolation between the transmitting and receiving antennas. The antenna consists of a thin rectangular cavity appropriately loaded with metallic septa to excite multiple resonances of similar desired field distribution to achieve consistent radiation characteristics over a wide bandwidth. Four pairs of concentric orthogonal radiating slots are cut out on one of the broad-walls of the cavity all of which are fed by two concentric orthogonal slots on the opposite broad-wall of the cavity. The cavity is fed by an end-launch coaxial-to-waveguide transition to excite one of the channels. The other channel is excited by a two-pronged microstrip line symmetrically crossing over the other cavity feeding slot. Due to the out-of-phase coupling from the two prongs of the microstrip line to the other port, this type of excitation is shown to provide an unpredicted level of isolation between the two channels over a wide bandwidth. To achieve a high-efficiency and fabrication accuracy of this complex architecture, the antenna is three dimensionally printed out of HP PA12 Nylon and is then metalized by silver spraying technology. The improvements afforded by this technology are relevant for a variety of applications such as hardware for the internet of things (IoT), electronic warfare, and 5G-enabled devices.",

    "ip_description": "Decorative, visibly-opaque but near-infrared-transmitting filters that reflect a desired color without reducing NIR transmission efficiency. Requires only a thin film, therefore amenable to scale up manufacturing. Infrared light has a wavelength that is just longer than that of visible light, and therefore cannot be seen by the naked eye. Still, infrared radiation has proven valuable for innumerable applications, including night vision apparatus, spectroscopy, photographic imaging, communications, and even decorative displays. Filters which block visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation but that allow the passage of near-infrared (NIR) light have great utility. Many NIR filters rely on organic dyes or pigments to absorb visible or ultraviolet light, though they suffer limitations due to photo and environmental instability. Additionally, other stable NIR filter options are costly and inefficient to manufacture. As such, a need exists for filters that are free from these limitations. Researchers have invented decorative, visibly-opaque but near-infrared-transmitting filters that possess high-efficiency and angular-insensitivity. These filters employ one-dimensional ternary photonic crystals to absorb visible light while allowing infrared light to pass through. The device permits generation of different reflective colors without affecting the near-infrared transmission performance. This structure utilizes stacking of seven layers of photonic crystals and semiconductor materials that also allow for the reflection of a desired color. This reflection of colored light enables the hiding of objects behind said filters without disrupting transmission efficiency. The other notable advantages of this filter are high angle invariant properties that produce mirror-like images over a wide-angle range, along with the requirement of only a thin film deposition layer for fabrication, which is highly amenable to scale-up manufacturing. This advancement opens up new possibilities for a variety of applications such as image sensors, optical detections, and NIR decorations.",

    "ip_description": "Accurate power measurement system for wireless EV charging. Minimizes errors in energy metering, reducing costs for consumers/providers. Applicable to reliable EV charging, fair energy billing, regulatory compliance. Electric Vehicles (EVs) are projected to consume 1,900 TW-Hrs of electricity worldwide per year by 2040. Accurate energy metering is crucial, as a mere 1% error in calculations can lead to a staggeringly large cost discrepancy for consumers and providers. Current energy measurement methods involve utility-type meters placed directly on plug-in EV chargers. However, with the advent of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems for EV charging, these traditional methods fall short. Power measurements are typically taken from the voltage and current of either the transmitter (Tx) or receiver (Rx). Measuring at the Tx can overlook transmitter losses, overcharging customers, while measuring at the Rx can miss receiver losses, undercharging customers. This omission creates a need for an improved method to measure transfer power more accurately and fairly between the transmitter and receiver. Researchers have created a Transfer Power Measurement (TPM) system that utilizes sensing elements to measure the magnetic field between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) in a wireless EV charging system. By capturing power transfer in the gap between Tx and Rx, this method can accurately attribute and minimize energy losses, ensuring precise metering. TPM acts like a gasoline fuel pump monitor, where an unbiased third party, such as the US Department of Agriculture's Weights and Measures Program, could arbitrate calibration and inspection. Proof-of-concept experiments have demonstrated power estimation errors as low as 0.059% to 0.839%, significantly better than prevailing standards. Applications include reliable EV wireless charging, fair energy billing, and facilitating regulatory compliance, ultimately enhancing consumer confidence and operational efficiency in the expanding EV market.",

Traditional methods to tackle disturbance rejection include feedback and feedforward techniques, often relying heavily on precise modeling of both the disturbance and the system. These models generally need to predict the behavior of narrowband, wideband, and non-periodic disturbances accurately. However, challenges arise when minimal information about the disturbances and the system model is available beforehand, limiting the effectiveness and adaptability of conventional approaches. Therefore a need exists for a more versatile method that can adapt to various types of disturbances without extensive pre-modeling work.

Thin films which facilitate use in mobile power generation, defense applications, and off-grid power generation. Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) energy conversion refers to a process during which thermal energy is converted to electrical energy. Compared to conventional photovoltaic solar panels, TPV panels have the potential for significantly higher energy densities and should be capable of providing comparable output power while using significantly smaller footprints. TPV devices consist of a thermal emitter and a photovoltaic structure tuned to infrared light. Upon absorption of heat, the thermal emitter radiates photons in the IR that are then absorbed by the photovoltaic that converts the emitted photons to electrical energy. For practical TPV devices to realize their theoretical efficiency and thus be economically viable, losses from the escape of photons from the thermal emitter to the environment need to be minimized.

Researchers have invented a thermophotovoltaic cell design capable of theoretical efficiency as high as 52% with power outputs of 2.1 W/cm2, assuming a 1500K thermal source. The improved efficiency and power output from this technology is achieved by utilizing a combination of anti-reflective coatings to promote above-bandgap photon absorption, a back-surface reflector to promote sub-bandgap photon reflection back to the thermal source, and appropriate spacer layers.

They offer the promise of widespread power generation from waste heat sources in a variety of industries, such as the manufacturing of steel. The widespread deployment of TEGs has been hampered because the most effective thermoelectric materials contain lead, which can present health hazards. Many of the candidate materials to replace current lead-containing TEG devices suffer from intrinsic chemical instability at elevated temperatures.

The trifluoromethyl functional group (-CF3) is important for the development of small-molecule drugs to improve desirable drug-like properties. From 2010-2013, 60 new fluorine-containing structures entered into the drug market, and ~40% of new small molecules that entered phase III trials in 2012 & 2013 contained fluorine. Although fluoroform is itself inexpensive (as it is a byproduct of Teflon manufacture), the cost of current trifluoromethylation methods is high due to the requirement of using expensive bases. Additional drawbacks to current methods stem from the fact they they require expensive bases, stoichiometric metals/salts, low temperatures, produce unwanted waste from strong Lewis acids, and have low generality. These issues decrease the feasibility of using organic and inorganic trifluoromethylation reactions in an industrial setting by significantly increase the cost of having fluorine in a drug. University of Michigan researchers have developed a library of recyclable borazine-CF3 adducts for trifluoromethylation reactions. These adducts provide optimal stabilization of the nucleophilic trifluoromethyl anion (CF3-) without undergoing undesirable and irreversible side reactions with common inexpensive, sterically unhindered bases. By allowing for the use of inexpensive bases, the cost of the trifluoromethylation reaction is significantly lowered. It is further lowered by the regeneration of the free Lewis acid after high-yielding CF3-transfer.

    "ip_description": "A radiation-assisted photovoltaic (PV) thermal management system that scatters solar radiation with wavelengths >8 \u00b5m while allowing infrared heat to pass through. It is mostly passive for continuous cooling and improved panel efficiency and lifetime. For all commercial photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, the performance of these devices decreases as the operating temperature is increased above 25 degrees C. In the sunny, dry climates that are ideal for PV installations, the average operating temperature of the panels is ~49 degrees C, and their performance suffers accordingly. Presently, the common practice for megawatt-scale PV arrays in the United States is to rely on passive convective airflow to cool the panels, which has limited effectiveness. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a radiation-assisted PV thermal management system ('RAPT') that continuously maintains the operating temperature of the PV panel at a constant temperature only slightly above (+7 degrees C) the ambient temperature of the panel's surroundings at peak solar times to prevent the deterioration of solar panel performance. The system accomplishes this by (a) deploying a novel cooling radiator between the rows of tracking solar arrays and (b) storing excess heat generated during the day so that radiative cooling occurs continuously throughout the night and day. The radiator system uses an emitter and a thermally insulating, selectively transparent cover to scatter oncoming solar radiation with wavelengths >8 \u00b5m while simultaneously allowing infrared heat to pass through from the emitter. Using liquid coolant and a storage tank, excess heat from the PV panels is transported away from the panels and either radiated into the atmosphere or stored for nighttime radiative cooling. As an additional benefit, the system will moderate the rate of temperature decrease of the panels during the cooler nighttime, mitigating the damage to the system from thermal cycling. The RAPT system has the potential to decrease the average panel operating temperature by 15-20 degrees C while buffering the temperature swings. This approach translates into a 6-8% increase in panel power output and efficiency (calculated for a crystalline silicone solar panel). RAPT also improves panel reliability and extend the panel lifetime to >30 years, which would surpass Department of Energy targets. Using a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) calculator developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the anticipated efficiency gain and prolonged lifetime is worth over $50/m2 (or ~$0.25/W), even when accounting for the slightly elevated operation and maintenance costs it would require.",

Increases oxygen balance without decreasing density, thereby improving detonation velocity and pressure. Enhanced explosives, propellants, pyrotechnics with superior performance. Explosives and related energetic materials like propellants and pyrotechnics store immense chemical energy, released via initiation events. This rapid release is enabled by the close proximity of fuel and oxidizer molecules. However, most compounds used as explosives are under-oxidized, which reduces their performance. Traditional energetic materials, such as CL-20 and HMX, are examples that suffer from this issue. Although optimizing oxygen balance can enhance the performance of these materials, introducing additional oxidizers typically decreases material density, thereby degrading detonation velocity and pressure. This trade-off between oxygen balance and material density has necessitated innovative solutions to achieve higher performance without compromising on essential properties. Consequently, there is a need for improved methods to balance oxygen content and material density in explosives. University of Michigan researchers have developed a groundbreaking approach to improve the oxygen balance of CL-20 explosives by replacing water molecules in its partially hydrated solvate with hydrogen peroxide. This innovative solution creates two polymorphic energetic solvates. These new solvates surpass traditional \u03b5-CL-20 and the hydrated solvate, \u03b1-CL-20, in terms of optimized oxygen balance. Using the thermochemical code Cheetah 7.0, both solvates demonstrated enhanced detonation parameters, including velocity and pressure, without compromising sensitivity. In particular, the orthorhombic hydrogen peroxide solvate is predicted to exceed even the exemplary detonation parameters of \u03b5-CL-20.

Explosives, and related energetic materials such as propellants and pyrotechnics, have a large amount of stored chemical energy that can be released with a suitable initiation event. This rapid release is facilitated by the proximity of fuel and oxidizer within the molecule. However, the majority of compounds used as explosives are under-oxidized, which decreases their performance. Explosives that are under-oxidized include nitroglycerin, which contains carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, with the carbon and hydrogen being relatively under-oxidized compared to its oxidized counterparts. These under-oxidized explosives can indeed have some drawbacks in terms of stability and performance compared to fully oxidized explosives. While lead azide has been the most widely used primary explosive, replacements are needed because of its environmental toxicity and impending regulatory changes to ban the material. Researchers at the University of Michigan have completed investigations of microporous coordination polymers that show great promise for creating intimately mixed materials with optimized oxygen balances through rationale design. These materials are suitable for use as high performance primary explosives, which are utilized in small amounts to trigger larger explosives. By starting with fuel-rich microporous coordination polymers and controllably introducing an appropriate amount of oxygen-rich guest molecules that adsorb to the nanostructured porous scaffold, the researchers have developed highly energetic materials with an optimized oxygen balance. The intimate and balanced mixing with the oxidant results in a hybrid material from two much less energetic materials that releases significantly more energy as measured by differential scanning calorimetry. This technology is well-suited for use as a primary explosive in blasting caps for mining and military applications.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "A safe and effective method to solubilize poorly soluble drug candidates. Enables oral delivery of poorly water soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Versatile approach suitable to a variety of APIs. Oral delivery is the preferred drug delivery route because of its convenience, high patient compliance, and cost-effectiveness. The drug must first dissolve in the gastric fluids before it can pass through the stomach lining and enter the bloodstream. However, the oral route presents several challenges. The acidic environment of the stomach and the presence of digestive enzymes can degrade some drugs before they can be absorbed. Additionally, the drug must be able to permeate through the gastrointestinal mucosa, which can act as a barrier to absorption. Therefore, to be effectively delivered orally, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) must demonstrate high solubility in gastric and other physiological media to achieve effective absorption. As a consequence, otherwise promising drug candidates that suffer from poor aqueous solubility are often abandoned in pharmaceutical R&D. Commercially viable, generalizable methods of solubilizing these promising compounds are urgently needed. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a metal-organic framework (MOF) system that has been shown to effectively increase the solubility of three distinct candidate compounds that otherwise demonstrate poor aqueous solubility, particularly in gastric media. The MOF acts as a drug carrier in the solid state but undergoes rapid decomposition upon introduction to aqueous media in physiological conditions. The result is a rapid release of the drug, leading to higher concentrations of the API in solution than are otherwise achievable. This supersaturation is sustained over several hours, providing for a large window in which the absorption of the compound into the bloodstream occurs at elevated rates. Upon exposure to physiological media, the MOF scaffold rapidly decomposes to its individual components, which are known to be non-toxic and easily processed by the human body. The MOF system has been shown to be effective with three different drug compounds already and should prove generalizable to a number of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, this novel approach can be applied to other water-reactive MOFs to expand the scope of candidate compounds that may be delivered with this general approach.",

    "ip_description": "A complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit capable of simultaneously generating power and capturing images. Useful for internet of things (IoT) devices in power-limited circumstances. Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors (CMOS) image sensors are useful in devices such as digital cameras, smartphones, and medical imaging systems. The desire for continuous monitoring via distributed sensors has increased with the expanded penetration of the Internet of Things (IoT). Still, the requirement for a separate power source to run CMOS image sensors limits their portability and convenience, stimulating research into self-sustained devices. One route for achieving this goal would include development of ultra-low power sensors, though interest persists for a self-sustaining operation via energy harvesting. A natural route for energy harvesting would be to convert light energy into electricity through a photovoltaic process, though poor efficiency due to a low fill factor makes this difficult in practice. So, a need exists for an improved method to manufacture self-sustained CMOS image sensors. Researchers have devised a technology that provides a new complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit that can generate power and capture images at the same time. The device uses an array of 100 X 90 pixels, each of which have an area of 5 X 5 square microns. The pixel structure stacks two diodes vertically in the same pixel, one of which acquires a positive charge and acts as the image sensor while the other collects electrons while operating as the energy harvester. The first pixel structure can generate more power than it consumes when operating at 15 frames per second (fps) if the illuminance is greater than 50 klux, while the second pixel structure requires 70 klux for generation to match consumption at 7.5 fps. The device provides photovoltaic energy harvesting via this pixel structure with a high fill factor of up to 47% for the imaging photodiode and 94% for the photovoltaic diode, a significant improvement over existing technologies. Further refinements may include a lower medal option in the CMOS fabrication process which could lead to higher energy-harvesting efficiency.",

These platforms offer numerous advantages over traditional biosensors, including higher sensitivity, improved stability, and compatibility with miniaturization for point-of-care applications. Even though various surface modification methods have been developed for subsequent immobilization chemistries, they often require a specific substrate material and are sensitive to fabrication conditions. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a mussel-inspired grafting method which can be used to attach various chemical functional groups to a wide variety of surface types. Possible surfaces include glass, polymer, and metal. The technology is based on a chemical formulation that includes dopamine, a known 'sticky polymer' that resembles the essential components of mussel adhesive biopolymers. Used in combination with other polymers and chemical additives, the technique has thus far been demonstrated to produce surfaces with exceptionally high densities of amine- and carboxylic acid-terminated functional groups.

Higher sensitivity and resolution imaging for currently established indications using NP-59. Lower radiation exposure than existing methodologies as well as a same-day imaging protocol. Positron Emission Tomography, or PET, in combination with radioactive tracing agents, is a standard medical imaging technique with a wide range of applications in oncology. Adrenal PET imaging utilizes the scintiscanning agent NP-59, which was developed at the University of Michigan. NP-59 is used to evaluate the adrenal gland to detect Cushing's syndrome, primary aldosteronism, hyperandrogenism, and euadrenal tumors. However, NP-59 has major limitations including suboptimal imaging resolution and a long biological half-life that leads to multi-day protocols and multiple patient visits, contributing to cost and burden of the procedure. Due to the clinical importance of the data that can be obtained, NP-59 has continued use despite these limitations. Still, the need exists for improved methods for adrenal gland evaluation with NP-59. To improve diagnostic accuracy, image quality, and shorten the procedure to one patient visit Michigan Medicine researchers developed the fluorine-18 PET imaging analogue of NP-59, [18F]FNP-59. This agent has excellent biophysical properties for PET imaging which significantly improve spatial resolution of the obtained images and lead to lower radiation exposure to the patient. In addition, this fluorine for iodine substitution reduces biological half-lives of PET imaging agents. A faster clearance leads to a clean background of the image for improved analysis by a radiologist, and it also allows for significant improvements of the imaging protocol. Overall, the [18F]FNP-59 agent provides higher resolution, better quality PET images while minimizing patient vital organs exposure to radiation as well as time and resources saving same-day imaging protocol.",

Enhanced physical properties such as mechanical stability, deformability, swelling rate, and gelling kinetics. Fully biocompatible and free from a need to use harsh or toxic reagents for stability or gelation. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is a tissue engineering technique that can produce biocompatible, complex structures from digital models in a manner which is analogous to conventional 3D printing for plastic based materials. This outcome is accomplished using materials collectively known as bioinks, which include broad classes of compounds such as hydrogels or decellularized extracellular matrix proteins to create synthetic organ-like structures. A significant advantage of bioprinting over conventional tissue engineering resides in its ability to produce well organized multicellular structures as well as bioligands and signaling molecules that can direct cellular assembly and architecture, mimicking the dynamics of organioid formation. The greatest limitation in the bioprinting industry has been the development of printer compatible bioinks that are affordable, that can be loaded with drugs or signaling molecules, and that maintain their designed shape during handling and for a defined time post grafting to the host organism. As such, a need exists for new methods to optimize this technology. Researchers have invented a nanocomposite material in which nanoparticles have been embedded in a printer-compatible master hydrogel matrix. This nanocomposite material confers enhanced physical properties such as mechanical stability, deformability, swelling rate, and gelling kinetics relative to currently available solutions on the market. The nanoparticles themselves, as well as the materials comprising the master matrix, have been shown to be fully biocompatible and do not require harsh or toxic reagents for stability or gelation.

Calculates and displays instantaneous blood flow and cerebral autoregulation. Traumatic and other brain injuries are often followed by secondary ischemic damage to the brain that results from decreased blood flow. As high intracranial pressure (ICP) is often the cause of the decreased blood flow, ventriculostomy catheters and intraparenchymal monitors have been employed to measure ICP. However, there are no reliable methods for directly monitoring cerebral blood flow, cerebral vascular resistance, or cerebral autoregulation available for use in traumatic brain injury (TBI) management. Methods to measure cerebral blood flow proposed in research rely on imaging and are inadequate as they can only provide information intermittently and infrequently. Furthermore, these approaches lack the sensitivity and dynamic readouts that allow physicians to make appropriate and rapid treatment decisions when time is the most critical factor for improving prognosis. There is a substantial unmet medical need for continuous monitoring of ICP and blood flow, cerebral vascular resistance, and cerebral autoregulation using technologies that can be easily adapted and used in the critical care clinical setting. Researchers have created a device that performs cerebral hemodynamic monitoring in real time. This outcome is achieved by an assembly comprised of a piezoelectric thick-film and fiber optic attachment that can be added to existing ventriculostomy catheters or intraparenchymal monitors so as to enable continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow, cerebral vascular resistance, and cerebral autoregulation. The sensor is encapsulated in biocompatible materials and only adds approximately 50-200 micrometers to the diameter of catheters which are presently being used for ICP monitoring. Electrical and optical readouts are integrated to calculate and display instantaneous blood flow and cerebral autoregulation from the measured parameters. Sensing and flow estimates can permit clinicians to determine whether cerebral blood flow is increasing, stable, or decreasing, and also if cerebral autoregulation is intact in response to interventions or as the body's response to brain injury progresses. Additional features may include fiberoptic delivery of spectroscopic technologies, allowing for the monitoring of oxygenation and metabolites.",

Aerosol acidity levels are vitally important for understanding atmospheric aerosol dynamics and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, but the ability to monitor changes in acidity has remained largely elusive. Current technologies rely on modeling, estimation, or expensive instrumentation. As such, there is a significant unmet need for an affordable, accurate method for direct detection of atmospheric aerosol pH levels.

Applies to optical coatings, LED diffusers, visibility control in IR and visible spectrum. Light scattering occurs when light rays deviate from their original path due to irregularities in the medium they encounter. This phenomenon is crucial in various applications, such as optical coatings for reducing glare, diffusing light from LEDs for better luminance, and creating obscurant clouds to block detection in visible or infrared regions. Historically, controlling light scattering has been achieved through various nanoparticle designs and coatings, but these often lack precision and are expensive to produce. Current methods can struggle with stability and dispersion, limiting their practical application. An improved, cost-effective, and stable method for manipulating light scattering is needed to enhance performance in these areas, offering increased control over forward propagation and backscattering. Researchers have developed 'hedgehog' particles for controlling light scattering. These particles feature zinc oxide spikes radiating from a central polystyrene sphere. This structure allows for the forward propagation of light while suppressing backscattering, as verified by spectroscopy measurements. By varying the size of the spikes, the scattering peak location can be precisely controlled. The particles are easily fabricated from inexpensive materials and exhibit higher feature size control compared to conventional light scattering nanoparticles.

Fingerprint sensors which are built into the screen, rather than set up as separate sensors, provide an opportunity for more screen space. The technology uses optical or ultrasonic sensors to capture an image of the user's fingerprint through the screen, allowing for a quick and secure method of unlocking the device. In-display fingerprint sensors are particularly popular with smartphones that feature full-screen displays, as they allow for a more immersive viewing experience and a sleeker design.

Useful in radar, far-field radar communications, and holographic. Control of the amplitude and phase of a light beam is important across several optics applications such as optical trapping, optical microscopy, and spectral imaging. This manipulation is usually accomplished through the use of spatial light modulators or deformable mirrors, though these methods suffer from poor spatial resolution and a narrow field of view. While advances in the optical field have led to the development of electromagnetic metasurfaces, they can only either modulate phase, amplitude, or polarization state, but not two or more of these at the same time. Thus, if a complex optical pattern is desired, it cannot typically be achieved with a single metasurface. Furthermore, metasurfaces have typically suffered from impedance mismatch problems and speckle noise. A need exists for a method to control the phase, amplitude, and polarization state of an arbitrary wavefront. Researchers have combined two gradient metasurfaces to control the phase, amplitude, and polarization state of an arbitrary wavefront. The technology allows for two degrees of freedom in design, enabling control of complex field distributions without reflection, absorption, or active components. The paired metasurfaces are separated by a distance on the order of a wavelength.

It's a subjective perception influenced by various factors including air temperature, humidity, air velocity, clothing insulation, metabolic rate, and personal preferences. Achieving thermal comfort is crucial for maintaining well-being, productivity, and overall satisfaction in indoor environments, whether it's in homes, offices, or other spaces. Thermal discomfort can have several adverse effects such as decrease productivity, decrease concentration, and even contribute to a condition known as 'sick building syndrome'. Understanding a person's thermal sensation and comfort is essential to defining the optimal settings for temperature regulating systems such as HVAC and potentially lead to energy cost savings. Thermal comfort levels can vary over time; this variation presents a significant challenge to dynamic control of an environment for maximal thermal comfort without constant input. Instead, there is a real-time monitoring solution and a means to adjust ambient temperature without human input.

Short-circuits in batteries cause rapidly release all of stored energy and can cause heat release that is capable of igniting the flammable components within lithium ion batteries. One of the leading causes of short-circuits in lithium ion batteries is the uneven deposition of lithium ions on the anode, which can eventually bridge the anode to cathode. In an effort to address this issue, battery researchers have sought solid-state electrolytes that provide a physical barrier to dendrite formation. An attractive material for these applications is lithium phosphorous oxynitride (LiPON), a rigid ceramic material that resists dendrite penetration while providing lithium conductivity. Limitations to LiPON materials as solid-state electrolytes include the requirement for expensive manufacturing equipment which limits production scalability. Furthermore, LiPON has poor ionic conductivity compared to anode and cathode materials, minimizing the number of useful battery applications. So, a need exists for improved methods to build LiPON solid-state electrolytes to overcome current limitations. Researchers have devised a method for producing solubilized phosphorous oxynitride (PON), lithium phosphorous oxynitride (LiPON), and silicon containing LiPON (LiSiPON) in a polymeric or oligometic state that is amenable to dip coating application to substrates of interest. Using this approach, phosphorous oxychloride is first treated with NaNH2 to generate the PON precursor which is subsequently lithiated using LiNH2 at a 90% molar equivalence to the sodium amide from the previous step. The resulting material can be found to have a uniform deposition of LiPON with significantly improved ionic conductivities compared to conductivities observed for vapor deposited films.

This method would ideally be cost-effective and ethically sound, addressing the gaps in existing technologies for better clinical and research outcomes in reproductive health. Researchers have created a method to leverage single-cell RNA sequencing data to reconstitute human Sertoli cells from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). By testing various differentiation cocktails, researchers discovered that an Insulin and IGF combination alone efficiently induces Sox9+ cells, crucial markers of Sertoli cells. By day 18, these cells demonstrate multiple Sertoli cell markers, including EMX2, WT, SOX9, and LHX9, with some cells self-assembling into organoids validated through immunostaining. This breakthrough offers a cost-effective and ethically viable alternative to conventional methods, allowing the generation of functional testis cells in a laboratory setting. Potential applications include treating male infertility, rejuvenating aging gonads, and replacing damaged testis cells caused by cancer therapies, thereby addressing pressing issues in reproductive and overall health.",

Using this model, apoptosis can be controlled at different levels by regulating the administration regimen of a dimerizer compound (AP20187) that triggers iCasp9 dimerization and apoptosis.

Easy to implement and customize for each facility's needs. Indwelling devices such as urinary catheters and feeding tubes are often used in nursing homes (NHs). Inadequate care of residents with these devices contributes to high rates of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) and device-related infections in NHs. The Targeted Infection Prevention (TIP) study was a cluster randomized multi-modal interventional trial to reduce the prevalence of MDROs and incident indwelling device-related infections in NH residents with urinary catheters and feeding tubes (Mody et al. JAMA Internal Medicine 2015;175(5):714-723). The TIP intervention was implemented in 6 nursing homes, while 6 control nursing homes continued to practice according to their own infection prevention policies. The TIP intervention included the following: (1) preemptive barrier precautions; (2) active surveillance for MDROs and infections with data feedback; and (3) NH staff education on key infection prevention practices and hand hygiene promotion. The multi-modal TIP intervention reduced the overall MDRO prevalence density, new methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus acquisitions, and clinically-defined catheter-associated urinary tract infection rates in NH residents with indwelling devices in the intervention group compared to the control group. However, there were no differences in the rates of new vancomycin-resistant enterococci or resistant gram-negative bacilli acquisitions, or in new feeding tube-associated pneumonias or skin and soft-tissue infections between the two groups. Mean infection prevention knowledge scores were higher for the intervention group compared to the control group after an interactive educational program. Hand hygiene and gown use was also higher in the intervention group, although glove use did not differ. This toolkit and implementation guide provides details about each intervention component used in the TIP study. Educational materials on infection prevention topics such as hand hygiene or indwelling urinary catheter care were designed for nurses and nurse aides and include: presentation slides, pre/post-tests, and interactive activity instructions. In addition, tools such as hand hygiene monitoring forms and infection definition pocket guides are provided.",

    "ip_description": "Novel method to extract and utilize silica from biochar for nanocomposites. Produces high-purity silicon-containing compounds without high-temperature reduction. Useful for cement production, reinforcing materials, nanocomposites, high-purity silicon products. BACKGROUND: Elemental carbon exists in various forms, including amorphous carbon, graphite, nanotubes, and diamond. Among these, biochar, produced alongside electricity generation from agricultural residues like rice hulls and bagasse, contains significant silica. Historically, this ash has seen limited use and purification, primarily in cement and reinforcing materials, leaving its potential largely untapped. Traditional methods start by converting the silica into metallurgical grade silicon (Simet) at extremely high temperatures, which is energy-intensive and costly. There is a critical need for a more efficient approach to harness the silica in biochar for producing high-value silicon compounds, reducing environmental impact, and unlocking the material's full potential. INNOVATION: Researchers have created a technique to extract silica from rice hull ash (RHA) and bagasse using stoichiometric and catalytic bases, bypassing the need for high-temperature carbothermal reduction. The enriched carbon content in the silica-depleted ash results in a useful nanocomposite containing dispersed carbon/silica. This mixture enables carbothermal reduction at significantly lower temperatures, producing high-purity silicon, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, and silicon oxynitride. The innovation not only optimizes the extraction process but also enhances the efficiency of producing high-value silicon compounds. Real-world applications include cement production, reinforcing materials for tires, advanced nanocomposites, and other high-purity silicon products critical to various high-tech industries.",

Amplifies detection signal via internal avalanche process, boosting sensitivity. Applications include environmental monitoring, industrial safety, chemical analysis, and medical diagnostics. Photoionization detectors (PIDs) have long been employed to detect volatile organic compounds and other gaseous analytes by employing vacuum ultra-violet (VUV) light to ionize them. The resulting ions and electrons generate a current that serves as the detection signal. These detectors, while useful, often suffer from limited sensitivity due to the inherent limitations in ion generation and collection. Technological improvements have sought to enhance sensitivity and reduce detection limits, but many existing solutions still fall short in demanding applications such as trace gas analysis and rapid detection scenarios. An improved method is needed to amplify detection signals, thereby providing more accurate and lower detection limits in various analytical applications. Researchers have created an Avalanche Photoionization Detector (APID) that significantly advances the traditional PID technology by utilizing a VUV ionization source and a semiconductor electrode system. The electrons produced by the ionization process are collected and accelerated within a reversely biased semiconductor P/N junction, creating an avalanche electron multiplication effect. This internal avalanche process amplifies the detection signal, markedly increasing the sensitivity compared to conventional PIDs. The APID's enhanced sensitivity makes it ideal for applications requiring precise and rapid detection of vapor phase analytes, including environmental monitoring, industrial safety assessments, chemical analysis, and medical diagnostics.",

    "ip_description": "High-current density Hall thruster for advanced propulsion applications. Increases thrust density and efficiency by operating at ten times higher current density. Useful for space exploration, satellite propulsion, deep-space missions, and advanced aerospace technologies. Hall thrusters have been a cornerstone of electric propulsion systems used in satellite positioning and deep-space missions. These devices generate thrust by ionizing a propellant and accelerating the ions using a magnetic field. Historically, enhancing the current density of Hall thrusters has been limited by thermal and electrical constraints, restricting their thrust density and efficiency. As space missions become more ambitious, there is a demand for propulsion systems that deliver higher thrust while maintaining efficiency. Current Hall thrusters struggle to meet these requirements, highlighting the need for innovations to achieve higher performance without compromising system stability or longevity. Researchers have created a novel approach to Hall thruster technology that operates at ten times the current density of state-of-the-art devices, dramatically increasing thrust density and enabling efficient operation on non-traditional propellants. The key features of this breakthrough remain proprietary but have been substantiated through performance metrics shared in a recent conference proceeding. By amplifying current density, the new Hall thruster offers a thrust increase, making it suitable for demanding applications such as space exploration, satellite propulsion, and deep-space missions.

    "ip_description": "Multi-color irradiation for ultra-rapid, continuous 3D printing. Enables larger dead zones for faster printing without support structures. Useful for prototyping, industrial manufacturing, medical devices, and customized products. The global 3D printing market is currently valued at around $4 billion with forecasted significant growth. Despite its promising potential, 3D printing has lagged behind traditional manufacturing due to high costs, scalability issues, and slower production speeds. A breakthrough called Continuous Liquid Interface Production (CLIP) has improved stereolithographic printing by enabling a continuous printing process, thus increasing speed. However, CLIP technology still faces challenges, particularly in maintaining the \u201cdead zone\u201d that prevents cured resin from sticking to the projection window, which varies with light intensity. High-intensity light speeds up polymerization but reduces the thickness of the \u201cdead zone,\u201d thus limiting the advantages of this technology. To truly capitalize on the benefits of 3D printing, new methods are required to overcome these limitations. Researchers have introduced multi-color irradiation to enhance ultra-rapid 3D printing in multiple ways. Instead of using a Teflon film, one wavelength of light creates the dead zone while a different wavelength induces polymerization deeper in the resin bath, making dead zone thickness independent of light intensity. This results in larger dead zones, better resin reflow, and faster continuous printing for larger cross-sectional areas. Additionally, patterned multi-color irradiation allows for 3D patterning to inhibit or initiate polymerization selectively within the resin, eliminating the need for support structures. This is achieved using a novel resin that combines photoinitiators with different absorbance characteristics. The resultant solidified objects possess near-neutral buoyancy, further enhancing printing speed and throughput. Real-world applications include rapid prototyping, industrial manufacturing, medical devices, and customized products, offering transformative advancements in 3D printing capabilities.",

Applies to high-resolution IR imaging, polarimetric sensing, compact IR devices. Infrared (IR) detectors are vital for a multitude of applications including night vision, thermal imaging, and spectroscopy. Traditionally, their performance is hampered by thermal noise, requiring cooling to cryogenic temperatures to improve sensitivity. However, cooled IR detectors are often impractical due to their bulky size and high power consumption. The demand for uncooled, sensitive IR detectors has spurred research into various designs, but these often fall short in terms of sensitivity and resolution compared to their cooled counterparts. The pressing need for a detector that offers high sensitivity without the drawbacks of cooling is paramount, especially for applications requiring compact and efficient IR sensing solutions. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed an advanced uncooled IR detector featuring an embedded bowtie nano-antenna designed to overcome the limitations of conventional and cooled IR detectors. This novel detector operates using a high-impedance nano-antenna integrated with a small low-bandgap InGaAsSb PN-junction, optimized for maximum power transfer and field enhancement. By operating at its anti-parallel resonance, the detector significantly boosts detectivity, outperforming conventional detectors by over 20 times due to the antenna's field enhancement factor. Its small pixel size, under 1 square micron, is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than current designs, making it suitable for high-resolution focal plane arrays and polarimetric imagers.

Can treat genetic disorders, cancer, and radiation-induced hyposalivation. Gene therapy has shown promise in treating various genetic disorders and certain cancers but often faces challenges related to delivery mechanisms, particularly those involving viral vectors, which can trigger immune responses and limit repeat dosing. Adenoassociated and adenoviral vectors, commonly used in gene therapy, have these limitations, making them less ideal for tailored treatments. Historically, non-viral plasmids have been explored but struggled with efficient delivery and cellular uptake. There is a critical need for a more effective, repeatable, and non-immunogenic delivery method. Ultrasound-assisted gene therapy offers a potential solution by using microbubbles to enhance plasmid delivery, thereby enabling more personalized therapeutic approaches. Investigators have created a product that combines a non-viral plasmid, an FDA-approved ultrasound machine, and microbubbles to achieve efficient gene delivery without eliciting an immune response. The plasmid is delivered using a GE ultrasound machine working in conjunction with FDA-approved Lantheus microbubbles. This method allows for multiple dosing, enabling tailored treatment protocols based on patient needs. Originally designed to treat radiation-induced hyposalivation, this approach has broader applications, including treating various genetic disorders and cancers.

Treats retinal detachment, age-related macular degeneration, retinal degenerations. Photoreceptor cell death is the main cause of vision loss in numerous retinal disorders, yet the treatment options remain extremely limited. Photoreceptors require a high level of metabolic activity, relying heavily on aerobic glycolysis, a metabolic process commonly associated with cancerous tissues. This reliance on aerobic glycolysis is critical for the survival and function of photoreceptors, with manipulations in glucose availability and metabolism significantly impacting photoreceptor survival. PKM2, a key enzyme in aerobic glycolysis, is found within photoreceptors, and genetic modifications of PKM2 in rod photoreceptors have shown effects on their morphology. Current treatments inadequately address the metabolic needs of photoreceptors, so there is a need for therapies that can support photoreceptor metabolism. The proposed innovation suggests metabolic reprogramming of photoreceptors as a novel therapeutic approach for various retinal disorders. By focusing on PKM2, an enzyme crucial for aerobic glycolysis in photoreceptors, this method aims to enhance photoreceptor survival through precise metabolic interventions. The creation of a photoreceptor-specific in-vivo PKM2 conditional knockout mouse model demonstrated that removing PKM2 leads to significant changes in glucose metabolism gene expression, affecting retinal health. Under normal conditions, loss of PKM2 resulted in retinal degeneration; however, in situations of acute stress, such as retinal detachment, PKM2 knockout mice showed increased photoreceptor survival. This underlines the potential of enzymes involved in photoreceptor metabolism as promising therapeutic targets. Real-world applications include the treatment of retinal detachment, non-exudative age-related macular degeneration, and other retinal degenerations, leveraging the high specificity of aerobic glycolysis to minimize off-target effects and improve patient outcomes.",

Useful for acne treatment, skin repair therapies, reducing skin irritation. Retinoids, derivatives of vitamin A, are widely utilized in dermatological treatments for conditions such as acne, photoaging, and psoriasis due to their ability to influence cell differentiation and proliferation. Historically, retinoids like all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) have been groundbreaking but are often associated with significant side effects, such as skin irritation and systemic inflammatory responses. Traditional formulations tend to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxicity, limiting their therapeutic potential and patient adherence. These shortcomings necessitate the development of improved retinoid compounds that retain beneficial effects while minimizing adverse reactions, addressing both the efficacy and safety concerns in dermatological applications. Researchers have created retinoid compounds, named VMC14, VMC29a, VMC44c, and VMC48, which demonstrate comparable efficacy to ATRA in promoting fibroblast survival, reducing keratinocyte cohesion, and inducing epidermal thickening - key indicators for effective acne treatment and skin repair. Importantly, these compounds show significantly reduced induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which suggests a lower propensity for causing skin irritation. Potential real-world applications of these innovations include acne treatment products that are more tolerable for patients, advanced skin repair therapies for conditions like wounds or ulcers, and treatments for inflammatory skin diseases, offering a more balanced approach to skincare and dermatological health.

Treatment of cardiac complications in DMD. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a severe genetic disorder characterized by rapid muscle degeneration and weakness. It primarily affects young males due to its X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. Symptoms typically manifest before the age of six, progressively worsening to affect voluntary muscles, the heart, and respiratory muscles. Historically, treatments have focused on symptomatic relief and supportive care, such as physiotherapy and corticosteroids, but these do not halt the progression of the disease. Cardiac and respiratory failure are the leading causes of mortality among DMD patients, with survival rarely extending beyond the early 30s. Existing treatments for the cardiac aspects of DMD are limited and often ineffective, underscoring the urgent need for innovative therapies that can address cardiac muscle degeneration directly and improve survival rates. University of Michigan researchers have pioneered a novel approach using P188 (Poloxamer 188) as a regenerative therapeutic for cardiac muscle damage caused by DMD.

    "ip_description": "The Nurse Leader EBP Competency Scale is a 16-question, self-administered instrument to measure competencies of nurse leaders/managers regarding evidence-based practice. The instrument assesses evidence-based competencies in two domains: (1) Their knowledge and understanding of evidence-based practice, and (2) Their activity/actions supportive of evidence-based practices on their units. The scale uses a 4-point Likert scale consisting of 16 items for nurse leaders/managers to indicate their perceived level of competency in understanding and applying key evidence-based concepts. Scoring of the scale results in a total competency score, and two subscale scores\u2014one for evidence-based knowledge and one for evidence-based activity/action. A guide is provided to score the instrument and interpret the findings. Nurse leaders are ideally situated to influence the use of EBPs in healthcare, as well as fostering unit climates supportive of EBP. There is a critical gap, however, in instruments designed to assess evidence-based practices of nurse leaders/managers. It is essential to assess competencies of nurse leaders in promoting use of evidence-based healthcare practices to improve quality of care and patient outcomes. The Nurse Leader EBP Competency Scale is short (only 16 items), has established reliability and validity, is easy to score, and was developed by experts in healthcare leadership and EBP. The Nurse Leader EBP Competency Scale can be used in research. For example, research about factors influencing adoption of a specific evidence-based clinical intervention (e.g., fall prevention) might assess the EBP competencies of nurse leaders to explore the association between the NM EBP competencies and level of adoption of the fall prevention practices. The Nurse Leader EBP Competency Scale can also be used for organizational improvement to assess organizational leadership regarding evidence-based practice. For example, an organization or health system might use the Nurse Leader EBP Competency Scale to assess nurse managers competencies regarding EBP knowledge or activities and then design educational programs to address areas in need of improvement. Similarly, if the assessment findings reveal a group of nurse leaders/managers with high competency, they could mentor those with lower competency scores and thereby improve unit climate for EBP implementation.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions Screener (COPCS) is a validated patient-reported classification screening tool for the 10 chronic overlapping pain conditions. It is based upon the published diagnostic criteria for each condition and uses a logic driven approach to increase the efficiency by which all 10 conditions can be assessed. The COPCS facilitates the identification of COPCs supporting the ability to conduct research on potential common mechanisms underlying these conditions and subsequent approaches to targeted interventions. The COPCS begins with a body map to identify locations of persistent pain along with several key triggering questions. Based upon location and these triggering items, the user is administered the relevant diagnostic criteria for each condition. Questions within diagnostic modules continue until the criteria are fulfilled. The module terminates as soon as it becomes impossible to meet the criteria for a given condition. The conditions that are assessed are the following: Chronic Low Back Pain, Painful Endometriosis, Fibromyalgia, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Migraine-type Headache, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Temporomandibular Disorder, Tension-type Headache, Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome or Chronic Prostatitis, Vulvodynia. Each condition is scored electronically and a report is generated at the conclusion of the assessment that identifies (a) each positively screened condition and (b) the number of COPCs screened positively within a given individual. A full description of the screener, its history, items, scoring, and validation is available in the User\u2019s Guide: Schrepf A, Williams DA, Maixner W.

    "ip_description": "Developed by researchers at Wayne State University, Michigan State University, and the University of Michigan, YES-HR is an adaptation of the original evidence-based YES program. As originally rolled out, YES-HR was implemented during middle-school social studies classes and aligned with the social studies curriculum requirements for the State of Michigan Department of Education. The program is designed to help students develop healthy relationship behaviors as they begin to explore dating, with the intent of preventing dating violence. The program is also designed to empower youth to develop leadership skills and engage them in developing and implementing school change projects that focus on collaboration while promoting healthy relationship dynamics and the prevention of aggressive dating behavior. Like the original YES program, YES-HR involves adults in the process of helping youth create solutions to dating violence and increasing healthy relationships. The YES-HR Curriculum focuses on developing leadership skills, community pride, program planning, and resource mobilization. Youth-led community change projects have included painting ceiling tiles and school murals with healthy relationship themes, a reading corner for a safe space for reading and discussing, a resource room for students with physical challenges, and creating an outdoor space for bringing youth together outside for lunch. Published evaluation results of the original YES Program based on a pre-post control group design demonstrated positive results 3 months post and 1 year post in promoting healthy development and reducing risks for violence and other problem behaviors. (Thulin et al., 2022; ZImmerman, et al., 2017) The developers have created a guide to assist organizations and communities in making decisions about selecting, implementing, and adapting the Youth Empowerment Solutions (YES) program. It is designed for individuals who are responsible for choosing, supervising, and carrying out youth programs. This guide is intended to be used in conjunction with the Youth Empowerment Solutions Curriculum. It includes sections on YES core components, assessing readiness to implement YES, determining the need for adaptations, designing adaptations, and reflecting on their results. A corresponding Evaluation Guide provides all of the tools necessary to conduct process and outcome evaluations of the YES program. YES-HR includes all the core components of the original YES curriculum. The original YES curriculum is based on sound theory and has proven results. The YES-HR curriculum includes detailed instructions including needed resources for the lesson for all components of the program. Training by the developers is available. YES-HR was tested in middle schools and incorporated into the social studies curriculum. By embedding the program in a required core class, entire cohorts of students receive the curriculum in its entirety.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The Michigan Vision-related Anxiety Questionnaire (MVAQ) is a validated Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) measure focused on psychosocial screening and monitoring for patients with inherited retinal degenerations. It can be utilized in therapeutic clinical trials for measuring the benefit of an investigational therapy on a patient\u2019s vision-related anxiety. An important new feature of the MVAQ is its ability to relate psychosocial reports to a retinal physiologic pathway. Furthermore, the MVAQ disability scores exhibit correlations with VA, phenotype, and self-reported feelings. Other PRO measures ask about a patient\u2019s feelings or concerns, but their responses cannot be linked to the pathologic defect underlying their visual impairment. In contrast, the MVAQ allows a clinician to map the concerns of the patient into an actionable area for improvement. As opposed to knowing that a patient experiences 'fear' or 'worry', with the MVAQ a clinician can identify whether a patient\u2019s rod dysfunction is the predominant cause of their anxiety, and recommend accommodations to their living setting and vision-related activities to address these specific anxiety-provoking situations. The current study demonstrates psychometric validation of items pertaining to vision-related anxiety in patients with IRDs and collectively form the MVAQ. The MVAQ measures vision-related anxiety due to dysfunction in either a predominantly cone pathway or a rod pathway. It can be used as a screening tool to direct the attention of a clinician to counseling and psychosocial interventions, as well as to measure baseline and follow-up vision-related anxiety for targeted low vision rehabilitation and psychotherapy. Finally, the MVAQ may also be incorporated in therapeutic clinical trials to understand the benefit of a novel therapeutic intervention for reducing a patient\u2019s vision-related anxiety.",

    "ip_description": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health problem among college students and many students have difficulty identifying unhealthy and abusive behaviors. The Dynamics of Interpersonal Coercion Among College Students tool is significant because it was developed and piloted in collaboration with a diverse group of college students, advocates, and administrators to reflect the unique experiences among college. The tool is rooted in theoretical knowledge related to the Socioecological Model and Theory of Planned Behavior to capture and portray the ecological influences experienced by college students as well as to explain and predict situational human behavior. As many as 50% of college students report experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) on college campuses (Murray & Kardatzke, 2007) and 57% of college students say it is difficult to identify dating abuse (Knowledge Networks, 2011). However, there has been little attention paid to the unique forms of power and control experienced by college students in their diverse relationships (e.g., romantic and sexual relationships, roommates, faculty/student relationships). The Dynamics of Interpersonal Coercion Among College Students tool was created using a rigorous scientific process including: 1) semi-structured interviews with college students (n=33) and staff (n=10) from the three University of Michigan campuses; 2) a draft tool was created and then assessed for accuracy using cognitive interviews with college students (n=20) from the three University of Michigan campuses, and 3) the tool was piloted with a sample of 250 students from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. All methods and analyses were informed by the Socioecological Model, to capture the ecological forces influencing college students' lives and behaviors as well as the Theory of Planned Behavior, to understand human behavior in certain situations. This resulted in a unique tool to represent college students' experiences with power and control by taking into consideration diverse identities and emerging tactics represented in a unique puzzle design. Tactics highlighted by college students included academic abuse, technology-based abuse, and stalking.",

The psychometrically validated patient-reported outcomes measure was reduced to a 59-item questionnaire measuring 7 unidimensional domains. A total of 39 items were removed due to poor factor loading, low item-information, poor person-ability differentiation, or high item-level interdependence.

    "ip_description": "The Buddy-to-Buddy program provides support and connection to resources to all Michigan service members and veterans by utilizing trained, veteran volunteers. The program is free, confidential and open to any individual who served, regardless of time served or discharge. Veteran volunteers are paired with veterans and service members in need, ideally from their own counties, or nearby, since volunteer veterans are expected to be knowledgeable of not only federal and state benefits but local offerings as well. The relationship should never be transactional: providing support as a peer is the foundation of the program, even if a wide array of more material and tangible needs are presented. Volunteers are trained in and expected to demonstrate excellent communication skills. There is never a 'one and done' with the program, as volunteers are expected to follow-up with their veterans/service members at least once, to see how resources provided worked out, or to do a general check-in. Volunteer interactions with veterans must be documented and reviewed by a staff member, both for accountability and quality assurance. Veteran volunteers do not take the place of existing resources, rather, they draw on their existing knowledge, and the resource guide provided by the program and connect veterans to these benefits and services. Volunteers provide 'warm hand-offs' by calling the resources first, ensuring ability to assist, and ideally obtaining a point-of-contact. Volunteer veterans are provided with an intensive, one-day training. This training provides an overview of the program, communication strategies, veteran benefits, and how to handle mental health emergencies. While rare, both veterans and the program must have a clear understanding of what to do when a veteran is having a mental health emergency and what 'red flags' to look for. The process must be codified by the program. Weekly support calls with staff, including guest speakers and case studies, are needed to keep volunteers proficient. Volunteer veterans can be assigned referrals through a call center, or through their work in the community. Buddy-to-Buddy volunteers have traditionally been allowed access to Michigan National Guard armories to take concerns directly from the soldiers there. Returning volunteers should be asked about their past involvement and possible continued interest in operation in the armories. Referrals are considered concluded when veteran concerns are addressed and the communication naturally tapers off. Some veterans and volunteers maintain communication and develop a friendship long after initial concerns are resolved. Team leaders are leadership volunteers assigned regionally according to MVAA prosperity regions. They provide mentorship and support to volunteers in their respective regions. Volunteers look to them first for leadership and advice on handling complex referrals. Staff are the next line of support for volunteers and team leaders. Team leaders should be carefully cultivated, and meet at least quarterly with staff.",

While researchers have developed instruments such as the Short Form-36 (SF-36) to measure and quantify overall health status, these general questionnaires may not capture the outcomes of interest for patients with upper extremity injuries and conditions. The MHQ was developed by applying psychometric principles to construct a tool capable of measuring health status domains that are important to patients with hand disorders. The MHQ's validity and responsiveness have been proven for a variety of common hand conditions and is currently being used as the primary outcomes instrument in several multi-center NIH-funded trials.

    "ip_description": "Interactive training to prepare community partners to interact with IRB and perform ethical research practices. The Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health Research (MICHR) at the University of Michigan has developed an interactive training to engage and prepare community partners to both interact with Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and to perform ethical research practices in their community settings. The goal of the training is to build community partners' capacities both to engage with the difficult academic review system and to make these regulations relevant to their own practices. MICHR hopes to increase the ethical quality of community-based research (vis-a-vis existing regulations) AND to promote a culture shift where IRBs come to recognize the unique ethical qualities and challenges faced by community-engaged research. This training is divided into three sections: Section 1 focuses on the history of current regulations and why they should be considered relevant and significant, at least in their core motivations, to community partners. Section 2 attempts to bring the informed consent requirements out of the legalistic language of IRBs and make them more intuitive and applicable in community settings. Exercises and activities challenge trainees to apply aspects of informed consent to situations they may face, and brainstorm potential solutions to them. Section 3 focuses on interactions with IRBs. We discuss the particular aspects of research with ethical importance to IRBs, how to communicate them to the boards, and provides sample documents that may be useful to both IRBs and community/academic partnerships in expediting review of their projects. All aspects of this training are available online for download. It can be used to facilitate a group session or individually.",

    "ip_name": "Lives in Our Hands: Overcoming Barriers to Patient Safety",
    "ip_number": "5382",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Lives in Our Hands is an educational video that can be used as part of a formal introduction to patient safety training for medical interns, residents, fellows and any other healthcare providers. The video tracks the course of the patients hospital journey through the perspectives of the mother and the intern involved in the case, and creates the opportunity for audiences to recognize and explore communication barriers and discuss strategies for improving patient safety and communication. This video depicts an actual, unanticipated outcome that results from a collection of preventable circumstances, and it allows the audience to observe communication and supervision issues that lead to a patient death. In 1999, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a report To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System that estimated that as many as a million people were injured and 98,000 died annually as a result of medical errors. This report concluded that the major cause of adverse events is not negligent individual performance, but poorly designed systems and patient care processes. This highlighted the need for open communication, mutual respect, and teamwork between all parties involved in patient care, including patients and their families. During the past decade efforts to develop and implement new safe practices and to train healthcare workers in patient safety have been initiated, but progress has been slow and uneven. National Patient Safety Foundation (NPSF) identified that while medical schools and academic medical centers do an excellent job of providing students with basic knowledge and skills, they do not impart skills, behaviors, and attitudes that are needed for practicing physicians. These include the ability to manage information, understand basic concepts of human interaction, patient safety, healthcare quality and systems theory. They do not receive instruction in skills needed to communicate effectively with coworkers and patients, lack management and teamwork ability, and do not know how to deal with their own feelings of doubt, fear, and uncertainty. The entrenched hierarchy of the medical training environment causes trainees to value their appearance to superiors more than safe patient care, illustrated by their reluctance to ask for adequate supervision, guidance, advice, or feedback. This culture of intimidation and fear deprioritizes safe patient care, and should be replaced with one of trust and respect. Case Scenario Highlights What Can be Learned from Medical Errors Lives in Our Hands is a 21-minute video that recounts the story of a severely injured patient who was admitted after a rollover motor vehicle accident, and how poor communication between providers, failure to escalate patient care concerns, and inadequate supervision ultimately contributed to the patients death. This video was shown at the University of Michigan during orientation to a group of new residents and fellows as part of a workshop to instill a culture of accountability, open communication, disclosure, and transparency in a healthcare setting. After viewing the video, trainees were able to identify key issues that occurred that led to a breakdown in patient care, placing emphasis on the importance of being able to ask for help from senior staff, and communicating with the patients family. In a survey that was collected after completion of the workshop to assess effectiveness of this video, trainees stated that they felt empowered to ask for help, and focus on patient care. They felt that the video added unique value to the workshop due to the candid nature of the interns testimonial and the mothers personal story of loss. To encourage patient safety training, the WHO has developed a Patient Safety Curriculum Guide for Medical Schools that includes training materials, and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) created an electronic Open School program. In addition, case studies, role playing, simulation applications, and patient stories have been utilized by various institutions to promote patient safety education and provide real-time problem-solving scenarios, but there is still a lack of high quality training materials. Lives in Our Hands is a short video that has a real human element that has engaged the audiences and demonstrated that patient-centered care must come before all other concerns.",

    "ip_number": "6581",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The FLACC pain scale is a behavioral pain scale used to score pain, assisting in recognizing, assessing, and treating pain in vulnerable populations. It is easy to use, score, and document, and is readily adopted into clinical practice. Infants, children, and persons with cognitive impairment frequently lack the verbal and cognitive skills necessary to report physical discomfort and pain intensity. The assessment and effective management of pain in these populations depend upon the observation and expertise of the care providers. Researchers at the University of Michigan developed a behavioral observation tool that can be used to quantify pain behaviors in infants, young children, cognitively impaired young persons, and children and adults who are intubated. The tool has been tested in these populations and found to be a reliable and valid measure of pain. Behavioral cues remain the primary indicator of pain in persons who are unable to use a self-reporting pain scale. The FLACC Pain tool incorporates five categories of behaviors. The acronym FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability) was developed to facilitate recall of the categories included in the tool. Each category is scored on a 0-2 scale, and the numbers are added together, resulting in a total score between 0 and 10. This range is often found in other clinical pain assessment tools. A score is obtained by reviewing the descriptions of behavior in each of the 5 categories and selecting the number that most closely matches the observed behavior. To use the scale, the clinician or caregiver should observe or interact with the individual for one to five minutes. Behaviors should also be observed during routine care. It may be necessary to touch and reposition the individual to determine if pain is present with movement and to assess tension and rigidity. The difficulty in using observations to assess pain is that there may be differences in what clinicians expect and observe. It is important to consider the patient's circumstances, environment, and time of the assessment. Parents and family members usually know their child's/loved one's typical behavioral response to pain and can identify behaviors unique to the individual that can be included in the assessment of pain. Keys to the use of behavioral pain tools are to focus on the individual's behavioral presentation (at both rest and on movement or during procedures known to be painful) and to observe for changes in those behaviors with effective treatment. Increases or decreases in the number or intensity of behaviors suggest increasing or decreasing pain. However, a behavioral pain score is not the same as a self-reported pain intensity rating.",

The government requires that anyone receiving federal research training awards and people working on federally funded research complete a minimum of eight hours of responsible conduct of research (RCR) training. However, studies have shown that traditional approaches to RCR training that use a lecture format do not change investigator behavior. The technology presented here was designed specifically to address the needs of K awardees in a way that is relevant to them and more impactful on their future behaviors. A Complete Seminar Implementation Package This package provides guidance and materials for an organizer to implement the RCR4K seminar, including a train-the-trainer session for the instructors and facilitators. The highly interactive seminar aims to develop early career faculty members into RCR mentors. It teaches a six-step process that helps the learners build their own foundations of ethics and regulatory knowledge. Over 6-8 weeks, they each identify a question about ethics or integrity arising from their own research experience and research relevant ethics and regulatory principles and local resources to formulate a way to manage the question. Attendees learn through large group didactic instruction, small group discussion and mentoring, presentation, and peer review with feedback. There are no quizzes; instead, participants demonstrate learning by producing a one-page issue summary and presenting a poster. This training model also works well with graduate students mentored by early career faculty.",

Applications include cancer diagnosis, monitoring, and personalized treatment adjustments. Microneedles have increasingly been integrated into medical devices due to their minimal invasiveness and ease of use. Historically, tissue biopsies were the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and monitoring, yet they are invasive, painful, and carry a risk of complications. While various non-invasive techniques exist such as liquid biopsies, these often require expert handling and can still be challenging to perform. Traditional microneedles have been successfully used for drug delivery and wound healing by exploiting the skin's porosity, but their application in cancer diagnostics remains limited. There is a need for a more straightforward, less invasive method to monitor cancer progression, allowing for real-time data collection without the discomfort and risk associated with conventional procedures. Researchers have created a microneedle array system that isolates cancer-associated extracellular vesicles (EVs) directly from the skin's interstitial fluid in a minimally invasive manner. These microneedles are sharpened to precise dimensions for optimal performance. A hybrid hydrogel of Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and alginate is conjugated with Annexin V (Av) protein, providing targeted affinity for cancer-related exosomes. This hydrogel-patched microneedle array can be applied and performs effectively due to its enhanced material composition and design.

Useful for traumatic brain injury care, high intracranial pressure monitoring, cerebral edema management. The retina, though part of the eye, is a crucial component of the central nervous system and receives blood from the intracranial internal carotid artery. Historically, monitoring oxygenation levels in the brain and central nervous system, particularly following traumatic brain injuries (TBI), high intracranial pressure, or cerebral edema, has posed significant challenges. Conventional methods are often invasive, risky, and not suitable for real-time, continuous monitoring. Due to these shortcomings, there is an essential need for a non-invasive, accurate, and reliable method for assessing cerebral oxygenation levels. Advances in retinal oximetry (RO) offer a promising avenue, leveraging the retina\u2019s blood supply to reflect broader intracranial oxygenation status. Researchers have created a retinal oximetry (RO) tool for non-invasive central nervous system oxygenation monitoring. Utilizing a specialized camera and dual-wavelength light, this tool captures real-time images of retinal vasculature to calculate tissue oxygenation based on color differences between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. Our proprietary algorithm then constructs a map of optical densities and calculates the optical density ratio (ODR), linearly related to hemoglobin oxygen saturation. This non-invasive method aims to provide accurate, real-time monitoring critical for the timely management of mild to severe TBIs, high intracranial pressure, and cerebral edema. The potential applications extend from emergency care settings to continuous monitoring within medical facilities, significantly enhancing patient outcomes in neurological care.",

    "ip_description": "Automated quantitative assessment of liver trauma using deep learning. Reduces observer variability and enhances trauma severity assessment. Useful for trauma diagnostics, triage tools, volumetric injury monitoring. Liver trauma accounts for approximately 5% of all trauma admissions due to the liver's large size, anterior location, and fragile parenchyma. Early detection and appropriate treatment of liver injuries can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. The gold standard for evaluating liver trauma is contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), with the American Association for Surgery Trauma (AAST) grading scale being the primary tool for assessment. However, this scale relies heavily on the subjective visual assessment of liver parenchyma disruption, leading to high intra- and inter-observer variability and potentially inaccurate quantifications. Thus, a need exists for an objective, automated approach to enhance liver trauma assessments. Researchers have created a fully automated image processing and deep learning framework to quantitatively assess liver trauma, addressing the limitations of subjective visual assessments. The framework utilizes deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze three-dimensional contrast-enhanced CT scans, generating initial masks for both liver parenchyma and trauma-affected regions. Post-processing integrates domain knowledge to minimize false positives. The system accurately computes liver disruption involvement (LDI) by calculating the percentage of liver parenchyma disrupted by trauma. The model demonstrates high precision, recall, and Dice coefficients. Real-world applications include enhancing trauma diagnostics, serving as a triage tool, and monitoring the volumetric progression of liver injuries, thus guiding better management and treatment decisions in clinical practice.",

    "ip_description": "Rapid tile buffering technology for efficient whole slide imaging. Reduces latency, enhances image quality, and increases program efficiency. May be used for digital pathology, medical diagnostics, biomedical research. Whole slide imaging (WSI) is revolutionizing pathology by allowing entire histology slides to be scanned and viewed digitally. This advancement permits remote consultations, easier storage, and more efficient analysis. Traditional systems, however, often grapple with high latency and inefficient data handling, leading to delays in image rendering and reduced image quality. Current methods typically rely on guesswork algorithms for disk read operations, which can be inaccurate and slow. As the demand for WSI grows, particularly in medical diagnostics and biomedical research, there is a pressing need for technologies that can provide higher quality images more efficiently and with minimal latency, thus improving the overall user experience and diagnostic precision. Researchers have created a rapid tile buffering technology that is a core component of the Iris whole slide imaging platform, capable of implementing a multithreaded image data transfer process. This method coordinates dynamically between a buffer-render thread and a user-feedback thread, redefining the amount of image data needed for rendering through numerous small buffering processes. This approach makes each upload process short, allowing the entire process to appear seamlessly interruptible. The technology significantly reduces latency and offers benefits such as higher quality image buffering, more accurate image scaling (mip-map generation), real-time data retrieval from disk, and overall greater program efficiency. Potential real-world applications include digital pathology, medical diagnostics, and biomedical research, providing a more rapid and effective way to analyze and interpret histological images.",

Consequently, there's a significant gap in understanding how individual patients respond to immunotherapy, which can lead to ineffective treatment strategies. Moreover, predicting patient sensitivity to therapy remains a challenge. The need for improved methods to capture and analyze immune cells in real-time has become increasingly urgent, as personalized approaches to immunotherapy hold the potential for better management of cancer and enhanced patient survival rates. The innovation involves advanced scaffolds designed to capture and analyze immune cells from circulation, enabling comprehensive monitoring of immune responses to immunotherapy. By integrating these scaffolds into therapeutic workflows, clinicians can assess immune activity in real-time, providing critical insights into therapy efficacy. This approach allows for the analysis of gene expression changes following treatment initiation, identifying which patients are likely to respond favorably or resist therapy based on pre-treatment signatures. The technical advances include enhanced sensitivity for detecting immune cell activity and a streamlined method for evaluating treatment outcomes. Potential applications range from personalized cancer therapies to improved clinical decision-making and research into immune dynamics, ultimately fostering a more tailored approach to cancer treatment and enhancing patient care.",

    "ip_description": "Spatial analysis of tumor microenvironments via multiplex immunohistochemistry. Captures intercellular spatial relationships for comprehensive immune profiling. Useful for cancer prognosis, therapy response prediction, tumor microenvironment research. The cancer microenvironment, a complex network of tumor cells, stromal cells, and immune cells, critically influences tumor progression and response to therapies. Traditional methods like standard immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry have been employed to characterize the immune infiltrate of tumors. However, these techniques have significant limitations. Immunohistochemistry is restricted by the number of antigens it can evaluate on a single tissue section, while flow cytometry analyzes cells in suspension, thereby losing valuable spatial information about cell-to-cell interactions. As such, there is a need for methodologies that retain spatial context while providing comprehensive immune profiling. Researchers have created a novel tyramide signal amplification (TSA) based multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) technique capable of identifying up to nine unique antigens in situ. This innovation allows for the detailed characterization of multiple cell types within the tumor microenvironment while preserving their spatial relationships. The method has demonstrated the ability to prognosticate survival in patients with metastatic colon cancer through the analysis of intercellular distances and cell engagement. Complex spatial models developed using this technique can also predict immune-epithelial interactions, distinguishing malignant from benign pancreatic pathologies, and identify cellular relationships indicative of therapy response in non-small cell lung cancer. Real-world applications include enhanced cancer diagnosis, improved prognostic assessments, and refined strategies for individualized cancer therapies.",

    "ip_description": "A microfluidic evaluation method to detect uptake of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by cell of origin. Enables preferential uptake of exosomes by organ-specific selectivity. May be used for diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment response in cancer patients. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived vesicles that are released into the extracellular environment to carry bioactive materials to recipient cells. This intracellular communication is increased in the setting of cancer cells, which release a higher number of EVs compared to normal cells. The study of EVs is therefore of significant interest as non-invasive biomarkers for neoplasm given that they may be recovered from various bodily fluids including, blood, urine, and saliva. The contents of EVs include RNAs and proteins that may reflect the molecular signature of a cancer and provide a measure for tumor cell aggressiveness as a surrogate for overall prognosis. Monitoring EV biomarker profiles during therapy may also provide an easy measure for treatment response. Current limitations of the use for EVs include volume requirements, time, sample complexity, heterogeneity among exosomes, and overlap of physical and chemical properties with other EVs contained in a sample. As such, a need exists for a method to overcome these constraints. Researchers have created a microfluidic evaluation method that chemically immobilizes cancer cells to enable uptake of their respective extracellular vesicles (EVs) for the purpose of screening organ specific EVs from heterogeneous biological samples. The methodology involves incubation of a sample comprised of multiple cell types in order to detect increased uptake levels of EVs which can be correlated with specific cells of origin. The microfluidic device facilitates an interaction between cells and certain EVs which enables preferential uptake of the exosomes by organ-specific cells due to organotropism. This approach bypasses the constraints of analyzing and profiling embedded proteins prior to EV isolation. One experiment confirmed uptake of lung cancer exosomes by cancer cell lines from the lung, bladder, and breast at a rate of 100%, 16%, and 40%, respectively. The CellExoChip device therefore allows for a simple reliable method to demonstrate the cell-exosome specific interaction, which can effectively screen specific EVs.",

Cancer diagnosis, personalized treatment planning, and research in metastasis biology. Cancer metastasis remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with existing detection methods often identifying tumors at advanced stages. Historically, imaging techniques and biopsies have been the primary approaches for detecting metastatic spread; however, they often lack sensitivity to early events. These traditional methods can miss subtle biological changes and may not detect small numbers of circulating tumor cells. Consequently, the therapeutic window for effective intervention is often lost. Moreover, existing technologies typically address metastasis after substantial tumor formation, limiting treatment efficacy. A need therefore exists for innovative approaches that can identify the pre-metastatic niche and associated cellular events are essential to enhance early detection and intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes in cancer treatment. The innovation involves engineered biomaterials that mimic the pre-metastatic niche, allowing for the early detection and treatment of metastatic cells. This technology leverages specialized scaffolds designed to attract and characterize circulating tumor cells before they establish secondary tumors.

Useful for ovarian graft health, fertility preservation, transplantation medicine. The need for effective ovarian tissue grafting is critical for fertility preservation, especially for cancer patients and those undergoing treatments that affect ovarian function. Traditional approaches have faced challenges, such as immune rejection and insufficient nutrient diffusion, compromising graft viability. Previously, single-layer hydrogel capsules have been used, but their utility was limited by poor nutrient diffusion and mechanical stability under physiological conditions. These shortcomings necessitate an improved method to ensure the long-term health and functionality of ovarian grafts. Innovations in biomaterials and tissue engineering offer new opportunities to address these challenges by enhancing both the mechanical resilience and biological functionality of the encapsulating materials. Researchers have developed a dual-layer hydrogel capsule incorporates thermosensitive gelatin microgels to enhance the immune isolation and nutrient diffusion for ovarian graft tissue. These microgels are embedded into the outer shell during crosslinking and melt upon implantation, forming micron-scale pores that improve nutrient flow. In vitro tests have demonstrated increased small molecule diffusion and enhanced mechanical resilience to strain with this new design. Ongoing mouse studies aim to evaluate the biocompatibility and functionality of the capsules over both short and long-term periods.

Provides more accurate blood pressure readings by integrating systemic vascular resistance estimation. Applications include medical diagnostics, wearable health monitors, and critical care settings. Accurate blood pressure measurement is critical in diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases. Traditional cuff-based methods often suffer from significant errors, with inaccuracies reaching about 15%. Historically, efforts to enhance measurement accuracy have involved analyzing arterial motion and sensor responses, but these approaches offered limited reliability and precision. Furthermore, existing commercial systems lack a robust method for monitoring peripheral vascular resistance, a key parameter impacting blood pressure readings. Research-level advancements, such as the Finopres finger-cuff monitor, have attempted to address this but with limited success and accuracy. Consequently, there is a pressing need for more reliable and precise blood pressure monitoring systems that can account for and integrate vascular resistance metrics. This invention leverages the comparative changes in amplitude of piezoelectric and photoplethysmogram sensors under a blood pressure cuff to estimate peripheral vascular resistance (SVR) and refine blood pressure measurements. By analyzing the characteristic behaviors of these sensors during cuff deflation, we estimate SVR and use this information to achieve more accurate blood pressure readings. Unlike existing methods, our approach incorporates the systemic vascular resistance parameter, significantly enhancing the precision of cuff-based blood pressure measurements.

Early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and renal failure. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, significantly affecting the quality of life for many. One crucial indicator of vascular health is pulse wave velocity (PWV), the speed at which the pressure wave from heart contractions travels through the arteries. Traditionally, PWV measurements are taken between two distant points in the vasculature, providing only an average estimate of arterial compliance. However, early atherosclerosis manifests as small, localized fibrous lesions along the vascular walls, which these traditional methods fail to detect. As a result, early-stage disease often goes unnoticed, delaying intervention and increasing the risk of severe health consequences. A method for detecting these local changes in compliance early on is urgently needed to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a novel method using standard ultrasound imaging equipment to measure local arterial pulse wave velocity (PWV) and intramural strain. This non-invasive technique allows for the local assessment of the elastic modulus of arterial walls, providing enhanced resolution, precision, and accuracy. By capturing both PWV and intramural strain at the same location, the method can determine the intrinsic elastic modulus, effectively distinguishing between healthy and diseased vasculature. This technology enables the early detection of reduced arterial compliance, a marker for diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and renal failure. Potential applications include routine health screenings, early diagnosis of atherosclerosis, and timely interventions to prevent disease progression, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficacy.",

Applies to detecting arrhythmias, classifying arrhythmia types, enhancing cardiac diagnostics. Understanding and diagnosing arrhythmias is critical for effective cardiac care. Traditional methods for arrhythmia detection often rely on electrocardiograms (ECGs), which can be limited in their ability to provide comprehensive data to accurately diagnose various types of arrhythmias. Historical approaches generally focus on single-domain analysis, capturing data in either the time or frequency domain, resulting in potential diagnostic inaccuracies and missed arrhythmic events. These methods also face challenges such as noise interference and limited signal quality. Furthermore, many systems lack the capability to classify different types of arrhythmias effectively, posing a significant challenge in clinical settings. This scenario underscores the need for an advanced and more reliable method for detecting and classifying arrhythmias to improve patient outcomes and assist clinicians in making more accurate diagnoses. The newly developed arrhythmia classification system addresses these shortcomings by collecting cardiac activity signals from any probing method and converting them into frequency, time, or phase domain representations for analysis. The evaluation stage extracts the energy density profile over various frequencies, time intervals, or phases, which is then summed and normalized to form dispersion metrics. These metrics are analyzed to determine whether a patient is experiencing an arrhythmia and to classify the type of arrhythmia. This multi-domain approach ensures a more comprehensive and accurate detection of arrhythmic events, reducing diagnostic errors.

Applies to continuous heart rhythm monitoring, atrial fibrillation detection, improved cardiac care. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a fundamental diagnostic tool used to assess cardiac function, particularly under conditions like general arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation (AF), which affects over 33 million people worldwide. Accurate, continuous ECG monitoring is crucial for managing these conditions effectively. Traditional methods and recent wearable ECG monitors fall short in providing reliable, high positive predictive values and have seen limited uptake among clinicians. This gap highlights the need for a more dependable monitoring solution. Wearable devices often lack continuous monitoring capabilities and may not meet the precision required for accurate diagnosis and management. Thus, an efficient and accurate method for continuous heart rhythm monitoring is needed to improve patient outcomes and aid clinicians in effective diagnosis and treatment.

Applies to treating atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, and guiding catheter ablation procedures. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia affecting over 7 million people in the US and the European Union. It is a chronic disorder that can progress to become permanent, significantly increasing the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Traditionally, anti-arrhythmic drugs have been used to manage AF, but they often prove ineffective and can cause harmful side effects. Catheter ablation procedures have emerged as a more promising treatment with high success rates, especially for paroxysmal AF. However, there is still an unmet demand for effective treatments for persistent and permanent AF. Historical approaches to intracardiac mapping require contact with the heart wall to measure electrical activity, a process that is time-consuming and dependent on a stable arrhythmia, highlighting the need for an improved, more efficient method. Researchers at the University of Michigan Center for Arrhythmia Research have developed an innovative non-contact intracardiac mapping catheter. This technology detects blood movement within a heart chamber and uses this information to localize the source of fibrillation in the heart wall. The catheter measures the electrical activity of the blood, which is then analyzed to pinpoint fibrillation drivers. This approach eliminates the need for direct contact with the heart wall, reducing the complexity and time required for mapping arrhythmias. The catheter was successfully tested in a simulated heart environment, proving its potential for accurate localization of fibrillation sources.

Provides hemostasis over a larger surface without specific identification of a bleeding site. Improves bleeding control and ergonomics with decreased cost compared to existing methods. Hemostasis, or the control of bleeding, is critical during brain surgery to maintain clear visibility, prevent complications such as hematoma formation, and minimize the risk of neurological damage. Small vessel bleeding is often managed by mechanical compression or electrocautery, though larger vessel bleeding is more commonly addressed by placement of surgical clips or ligatures. Hemostatic agents can be applied to promote clotting in areas that are more anatomically difficult to visualize or reach with other approaches. Ultrasonic dissection devices provide coagulation as the brain tissue is being cut, while laser coagulation can be useful for deep or inaccessible regions of the brain. While each of these approaches has its own advantages, limitations exist based upon bleeding severity, challenges associated with applying pressure, ease of use, and cost. So, a need exists for an improved method to help brain surgeons maintain hemostasis during a resection. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a Vacuum Hemostasis Surgical Device to improve bleeding localization and control, ergonomics, and affordability of brain tumor resection procedures. The device is an extension that can be added to existing suction tubing. This extension consists of a suction tubing adapter, suction chamber, and perimeter balloon that adheres to rounded and multi-contour surfaces. The device utilizes negative suction from the tubing to clear the bleeding and induce hemostasis during surgery. The perimeter balloon allows suction to be applied to large tissue surfaces while negating the need to localize the specific site of bleeding. The ability to provide hemostasis without spending excessive time localizing the site of bleeding will increase surgical efficiency and throughput. The induction of negative suction and the perimeter balloon allows the suction device to be attached to the tissue in a hands-free manner. Future versions of this device will facilitate its use in other procedures prone to excessive bleeding, such as intra-abdominal surgery.",

Traditional DBS systems deliver continuous electrical pulses to specific brain regions to modulate the neural activity that becomes dysregulated in these disorders. The 'closed-loop' aspect refers to the capability of the system to adjust stimulation parameters in real-time based on feedback from the patient's brain activity. The 'log domain' term refers to the domain in which the stimulation parameters, like frequency or amplitude, are adjusted on a logarithmic scale in response to this feedback. Unfortunately, existing algorithms and systems utilized for closed-loop operation are imperfect and optimal results from their use remain elusive. While spike sorting and principal component analysis (PCA) approach holds promise, it requires significant computation that makes radio-frequency (RF) or long-term battery powered operation difficult. As such, a need exists for an improved methodology to perform closed-loop log domain deep brain stimulation. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed a single-chip log-based wirelessly-powered closed-loop DBS system with RF telemetry that overcomes the issues prevalent in existing designs. The system-on-a-chip (SoC) architecture makes use of the energy of Low Frequency Field Potentials (LFPs), a more effective feedback indicator for DBS than the traditional spike sorting and PCA approach. The system optimizes stimulation parameters by analyzing measured LFP energy and incorporating extensive two-way telemetry that involves filtering of spike and LFP signals. Since neural signals are expressed and processed in the log-domain, substantial energy savings from this new approach may be realized. Furthermore, aside from certain high-voltage components, the entire system is powered using energy recovered from a carrier signal by an efficient RF to DC converter. The benefits of this standalone and unified system include increased efficacy of treatment for patients treated with DBS for movement disorders.",

May provide a means to increase the pool for acceptable donor lungs for transplantation. Lung donors are extremely rare, with strict criteria employed to select suitable donor lungs. The ideal lung donor has an age of <55 years of age, excellent blood gas parameters, short or no smoking history, and a clear chest radiograph. It is therefore not surprising that approximately 70% of evaluated lungs are declined for transplant. As donor lungs are therefore extremely rare, options are increasingly being explored to expand the donor pool, including the use of extended-criteria donors. If it were possible to find donors whose parameter fall below these ideal criteria while providing acceptable short- and long-term results, the pool of available lungs for transplantation would correspondingly expand. Researchers at the University of Michigan have developed an automated machine learning method based on dictionary learning of unique features extracted from medical images to improve lung donor screening prior to transplantation. The automated machine learning mechanism is based upon a dictionary approach to screen 'good versus bad' lungs from the data provided by computed tomography scans. This distinction has been developed through the collection of 5,000,000 image patches of size 15 x 15 pixels from segmented lungs to train a dictionary for each class.
