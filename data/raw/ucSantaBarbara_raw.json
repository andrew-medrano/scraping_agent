This series of novel sulfur-fused perylene diimides (PDIs) shows significant promise in improving the fill factor, electron mobility, and overall efficiency of bulk heterojunction solar cells. These new compounds, 2PDI-nS, where n is an integer, have been utilized both as electron acceptors in organic solar cells and as electron transporting layers in perovskite solar cells, demonstrating high device fill factor, low open circuit voltage loss, and improved device efficiency and stability. Moreover, 2PDI-nS as an electron transporting layer in perovskite solar cells led to improved device efficiency and stability. 2PDl-nS can be synthesized in five steps with high overall yield, and the sulfuration reaction can be applied to various POI derivatives. The fused POIs have glassy structure, strong light absorption, high electron mobility and tunable LUMO, can be potentially used as ETL in perovskite solar cells, electron acceptor in organic solar cells and active layer in n-type transistors.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara have formulated a novel method of using crowdsourced GNSS data to create three-dimensional maps, creating a low-cost alternative to lidar and aerial photography. Furthermore, they have developed a method for using three-dimensional maps in a Bayesian localization and tracking framework to substantially improve GNSS-based localization in built-up environments. The methods developed exploit the blockage of satellite signals to enable 3D mapping and improve localization by using information already available in the GNSS receiver regarding the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) corresponding to each satellite it sees. If the line of sight (LoS) path from the receiver to a satellite is blocked (i.e., the receiver is in the shadow of a structure), then the SNR is likely to be small. Conversely, if the LoS path is available, the SNR is likely to be high. This observation forms the basis for a Bayesian estimation and tracking framework for \u201cprobabilistic shadow matching,\u201d which enables both 3D map creation using crowdsourced GNSS measurements, and improved location for an individual GNSS device given a 3D map of the environment. These improved mapping and localization capabilities can be used by a myriad of organizations including telecommunication providers, mapping services, flight simulators, video game companies, and the military.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara have designed a trench Schottky barrier diode featuring a high-k dielectric RESURF (reduced surface field) and a low work-function metal contact. By utilizing the trench geometry, the electric field at the metal/semiconductor junction is reduced and pushed deeper into the fin bottom. Incorporating the high-k dielectric enables the deposition of thicker dielectric material, enhancing the breakdown voltage while simultaneously reducing dielectric leakage, all without compromising the impact of RESURF. The decreased electric field at the metal/semiconductor junction allows for the use of a low work-function metal, reducing the turn-on voltage and consequently reducing the forward voltage drop. The high-k trench SBD has the potential to be employed in power converters capable of achieving very high-power efficiency by simultaneously reducing the forward voltage drop and reverse leakage current. The high-k trench SBD offers several key advantages including improved power efficiency, due to a reduction in both the forward voltage drop and reverse leakage current; faster switching, making it a viable alternative to traditional pn junction diodes for high-voltage high frequency switching applications; versatility and efficiency, leading to opportunities for a wide-range of applications; and reduced heat generation.",

It consists of identical modules with two inputs and two outputs, allowing stacking of modules combining two outputs of each module with two inputs of the next module. The pulse slicer is capable of flexible pulse durations (>1 ns) with customizable start and stop timings over a broad range of frequencies (>150 GHz). The design incorporates a laser-driven silicon switch at Brewster's angle to incoming terahertz radiation to limit undesired reflections in the \"off\" state and ensure that terahertz power is only transmitted when the switch is \"on\". Further, an \"off\" switch ensures that no power is leaked after the pulse and that the switching profile is sharp. The slicer's small footprint (48x72x162 mm) and small insertion loss (1.2 dB at 320 GHz) as well as high switching efficiency (>65%) allows pulse slicers to be stacked to create complex pulse sequences. An additional feature of the pulse slicer is splitting of the laser pulses generating pulses 2, 3, etc. and directing a part of the radiation to the preceding switches maintaining a high reflection in the on state thus overcoming limitations imposed on times between pulses due to the carrier\u2019s relaxation in the switch material. This design will enable more complex kW-power pulse sequences than existing pulse slicers for free electron laser or gyrotron-powered pulsed ESR and has potential applications for pulsed DNP.",

Nano-porous AlGaN has a much lower refractive index than that of a non-porous AlGaN layer with the same Al composition of the AlGaN. This consequently removes the condition to grow thick cladding layers with high Al composition. Instead, similar optical confinement can be achieved with thinner, lower-Al-content layers that can be easily formed on GaN substrates without cracking defects. In addition, the Al composition of the nano-porous n-AlGaN cladding layer is lower than that of conventional structure, which minimizes strain that would otherwise cause cracking defects and also minimizes the generation of new dislocation defects at the interface between the LD structure and nano-porous n-AlGaN cladding.

    "ip_description": "Gallium nitride (GaN) vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) have attracted attention with their ability to emit in visible and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, affording a wide swath of exciting new applications in displays, solid-state lighting, sensing, and communications. Visible light communications (VLC) is a particularly attractive application for GaN VCSELs where they can be coupled with a phosphor to act as both a light source and data transmission device simultaneously. With the extensive proliferation of devices that can access networks, efficient data transmission has become a high priority, especially as bandwidths are becoming overcrowded. Realizing data transmission at visible wavelengths would greatly expand current bandwidth capabilities, but achieving this task will require solutions to the device degradation caused during lens growth and absorption loss within the long cavities of GaN VCSELs. Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara have produced a GaN VCSEL that achieves high efficiency, high peak power, and long device lifetimes by eliminating degradation to the active region, improving emission intensity, and significantly reducing absorption loss within the cavity. Key to the invention is the topside dielectric p-side lens which provides the mode control characteristics. Topside fabrication eases pain points with processing and alignment in addition to putting more distance between the active region and the planar DBR. The topside lens allows for the active region to be farther up in the cavity, increasing the maximum width of the beam and current aperture. The use of wider apertures enables higher packing densities, positioning this VCSEL design especially well for high-power directional lighting applications or other applications where an array of VCSELs with a wide divergence angle is of interest.",

For an LD structure, an n-type InGaN waveguiding layer is then grown, followed by an active region, p-type electron blocking layer (EBL), p-type InGaN waveguide and p-type GaN or p-type InGaN layers. For an LED structure, the n-type, p-type or both InGaN waveguiding layers may be omitted. This technology improves the layer structure and growth conditions for green InGaN emitters, resulting in higher power output and higher efficiency.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara have developed an ultra-compact resistive-random-access-memory (RRAM) cell with industry-leading switching speed (<10ns), low access latency, and low energy consumption. This nonvolatile and manufacture-friendly memory technology combines a transition-metal-dichalcogenide (TMDC) graphene-based heterojunction field-effect-transistor with hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) based RRAM to form a single device. The hybrid structure, which can be considered as a \u201c0.5T0.5R\u201d memory cell, reduces the device count by half and is the first of its kind in RRAM technology history. Its design affords lower operation voltage, extraordinarily fast switching speed, long retention time, high ON/OFF ratio, high endurance, and low switching energy in contrast to ubiquitous charge- and silicon-based memory. This invention stores much more information with higher performance compared to conventional alternatives and can serve as the foundation for a new generation of intelligent chips, changing the ways we process and store information.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara have developed a spin dewetting technique that achieves the selective deposition of spontaneously-formed polymeric coatings on heterogeneous substrates without substrate pre-treatment or post treatment. This novel approach is enabled by spin coating, and selectivity is induced by polymer design that promotes preferential dewetting from one substrate material and uniform wetting on the other. As evidenced by studies with homogeneous surfaces, polyacrylates containing semi-fluorinated pendant groups spontaneously dewet from SiO2 but form continuous films on Cu. When spin coated onto Cu/ SiO2 line\u2013space patterns, these semi-fluorinated polymers selectively coat Cu without any pre- or post-processing. Rational design rules that anticipate regimes of selective deposition have been developed, which connect the droplet size of dewetting structures on homogenous SiO2 with the dimensions of heterogeneous Cu/ SiO2 patterns. The universality of these rules is demonstrated across a library of polymers with varying molecular weight and monomer structure. This technology leverages the simplicity and rapidity of spin coating to reduce the entire patterning process to one step that is complete in under one minute. \n\nAdvantages\n\nThin film deposition on imperfect, heterogeneous substrates \nNo substrate pre- or post-treatment required \nSingle step patterning process is complete in less than one minute  \n\nApplications\n\nIntegrated circuits \nPhotonic devices \nSensors \nTailorable adhesion",

The self-anchoring feature eliminates the requirement of external reaction force to burrow, allowing the device to be implemented into small, mobile robots and enabling remote placement of underground sensors with minimal soil disturbance. Inspired by a plant root, which remains stationary relative to its surroundings as its tip grows, the soft burrowing robot consists of a thin-walled tubular body that is initially inverted inside itself and everts when pressurized, passing new material out of the tip. It can also deploy root hairs, branch, swell radially, and retract by pulling back on the tip to reinvert material. Since there is no relative motion of the body with respect to the granular medium, frictional forces along the sides is eliminated and only the normal forces at the tip oppose the robot\u2019s growth. \n\nAdvantages\n\nTip-extension reduces soil disturbance compared to drilling or hammering \nEnables remote sensor placement in various granular media and organic soils with little or no reaction force \nPneumatic tip extension enables robot to burrow faster than alternative mechanisms \nAbility to create hollow conduits for applications such as wire or irrigation line installation  \n\nApplications\n\nAgriculture and Botany \nCivil and Geotechnical Engineering \nSpace Exploration",

When using a curved mirror, the reflected light can be focused back into the center of the aperture, thus minimizing diffraction loss. The curved mirror also affords the use of a long cavity, allowing for better thermal management and significant reduction of thermal rollover, thus increasing lifetime and reliability of the VCSEL. Additionally, the tight mode spacing of this technology allows for a greater tolerance of the cavity length, which increases the yield during device growth and fabrication.",

The p-GaN is difficult to contact electrically and has low hole concentration and mobility. This means that p-GaN cannot be used as a current spreading layer and that traditional p-contacts will add significant voltage to devices. Despite these inherent problems, all commercial light emitting devices utilize a p-contact and a material other than p-GaN for current spreading, typically transparent conducting oxides (TCO). Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara have introduced an n-GaN layer that produces less loss than a traditional transparent conducting oxide. The favorable current spreading of the n-GaN layer also helps to reduce the droop observed in previous iterations of III-Nitride LEDs. The combined benefits of this novel current spreading layer materialize into a device with over 70% wall plug efficiency. Advantages include improved light extraction, improved energy efficiency (over 70%), and no requirement for TCOs or mirrors. Applications include III-Nitride LEDs.",

One challenge to silicon photonic fabrication is the mismatch that occurs when III-V materials are grown on native III-V substrates then transferred to silicon substrates using the wafer bonding process. This mismatch can result is increased defects and degradation of material quality and device efficiency. Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara have developed a new method of photonic integrated circuit fabrication where quantum dot III-V material and silicon waveguides are both grown on silicon substrates and are bonded using the wafer bonding process.

The method of detection is rapid, inexpensive, and simple, and it can be used to identify a variety of bacterial species. This strategy is based on the interaction between bacterial cells and the viruses that infect them, phages. Colorimetric sensing allows for clear detection using a visible spectral shift that is produced around aggregation around cell phage complexes. Thiolation of engineered phages allows binding of gold nanoparticles, which aggregate on the phages, amplifying the interaction and resulting in a visible color change. It can be applied to any bacteria that are targeted from a metagenomic sample. While the standard detection time is four hours, this technology can detect bacteria in twenty minutes, or less. This detection strategy requires minimal lab equipment and minimal training. Engineered phages can also be used to selectively target and kill and various bacterial cell types. The phages used can be of any type, serotype, or species. The approach involves a topical application, and is not injected into the body, making it easy to initiate. Further, the phage-targeted thermoablation of selected bacterial cells provides a way to selectively kill harmful organisms while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue.",

Despite steady and significant increases in R&D spending, an increase in the number of new drug applications and approvals has not been seen. Current target-driven approaches to drug discovery limit focus to a single target and have phenotypic effects such as toxicity and low efficacy that are discovered too late in the discovery process. As a result, current interest is shifting towards evaluating biological properties at the onset and attempting to gain a global understanding of the binding activity between compounds and targets. There have been a number of attempts to understand the relationship between drug chemical structures and target proteins, including pharmacophore based screening. A key weakness of existing pharmacophore based technologies is its ability to analyze compounds only on target-by target basis, aimed at extracting and optimizing a specific pharmacophore. Often, multiple pharmacophoric targets need to be analyzed in the search for drugs against diseases such as cancer or AIDS. Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara have proposed a novel method for pharmacophore analysis by examining the Joint Pharmacophore Space (JPS) of chemical compounds, targets, and chemical/biological properties. The underlying geometry of the pharmacophores is responsible for binding between compounds and targets as well as properties of compounds such as Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability. The use of geometric pharmacophoric features allows for the consideration of different conformations of compounds and isolation of the geometry of important pharmacophoric points in these conformations.

Oral dosing of active agents is attractive for many reasons, including ease of administration and high patient compliance. However, for some active agents, such as poorly absorbed, sensitive, and/or high molecular weight active agents, oral dosing is ineffective for achieving sufficient blood concentration of the active agent as compared to alternative dosing strategies. Furthermore, macromolecules such as proteins and polypeptides have become an important component of therapeutic drugs. However, these macromolecules must be administered through an injection limiting their acceptance by patients. While oral delivery is the preferred method of patients, its use is limited by proteolytic degradation in the stomach and intestine as well as by low permeability of the epithelial barrier. Researchers have attempted a number of strategies to circumvent the hostile environment of the GI tract, but they lack the ability to fully protect the active agent. Therefore they suffer from low efficacy. Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara have developed systems for transmucosal delivery of active agents. These systems include mucoadhesive devices inspired by the design of transdermal patches. Such systems advance the transmission of active agents by improving absorption and directionality of such agents. The directional delivery of active agents to a tissue dramatically increases the local concentration of an active agent, improving absorption. This prevents unwanted absorption of other materials and allows for a direct target and release. Transmucosal delivery, as an alternative dosing strategy to injections, allows for an effective and easily accepted oral delivery system that will lead to an increase of treatment successes.",

These hardware solutions have wide-ranging applications including IC identification, secure channel communication, and data encryption. In any case, none would require \u201ckey\u201d storage in auxiliary memory, making it virtually impenetrable from attack. Advantages include fast & low power operation (10 ns / 20 uW per bit), CMOS compatibility, random & unpredictable primitives, low chip-area overhead (scalable to 28nm+), programmability, enhanced resilience against attack (including machine learning attacks), reconfigurability, and excellent physical characteristics (1600 F2/bit density and up to 41 fJ/bit energy efficiency).

    "ip_description": "Methods of physical vapor deposition for III-nitride tunnel junction devices. Current commercially-available III-Nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and edge-emitting laser diodes (EELDs) use an active region in a biased p-n junction to allow for electron and hole injection. However, since p-type gallium nitride (p-GaN) is difficult to contact electrically and has low hole concentration and mobility, p-GaN cannot be used as a current spreading layer and traditional p-contacts will add significant voltage to devices. Despite these inherent problems, all commercial light emitting devices utilize a p-contact and a material other than p-GaN for current spreading, typically transparent conducting oxides (TCO). A tunnel junction is a diode comprised of a very highly doped (n+/p+) interface that allows for electrons to tunnel between the valence band conduction band. Although in principle a highly doped Esaki-type homojunction diode should provide the lowest-loss tunnel junction, there have been a number of difficulties achieving high quality tunnel junctions in the GaN material system. Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara have satisfied the need for improving the performance of III-nitride devices by overcoming the limitations currently in the field. Improvements include alternative methods for creating tunnel junction devices, including physical vapor deposition (e.g., sputter deposition) and MOCVD regrowth deposition, and III-Nitride tunnel junction improvement through reduction of the magnesium memory effect. Self-emissive III-V micro LED-based displays using low resistance tunnel junctions leveraging these improvements have been fabricated.",

Researchers at UC Santa Barbara have developed a bioconjugation method to covalently link molecular entities to polypeptides such as antibodies using a simple one-pot process. Tests show that two cyclopentadiene derivatives could be incorporated site-specifically into an antibody and react with quantitative conversion with the maleimide-drug Vedotin. This reaction can be employed under mild conditions in specific conjugation reactions comprising a biological molecule. In some instances the reaction takes as little as two hours at room temperature with no added reagents or catalysts. The key feature of this strategy is the serum stability of the linkage compared to the commonly used thiol-maleimide bond, potentially improving the pharmacokinetic properties of the ADC. This improved serum stability is independent of the site of incorporation, which would streamline ADC development compared to the THIOMAB strategy. Advantages include: Uses commercially available off-patent maleimide-drugs, Can be produced in high yields, Reactions can take as little as two hours at room temperature, Is a simple one-step process, More stable in serum than thiol-maleimide. Applications include: Pharmaceutical products (ADCs or radioactive tracers), Other conjugation uses (biochemical studies, bioceramics, polymers, nanochemistry).",

Using this algorithm to reconstruct the surface deformations of microdroplets injected between cells, it is possible to quantify cellular forces.

Severe bleeding poses a very real risk of death to the casualty if not treated quickly. When a laceration or penetrating trauma (e.g., knife or gun wound) is severe enough or involves critical arteries or veins, the bleeding must be slowed immediately or irreversible damage to organs and mortality can result. In recent years, scientists have attempted to reduce blood flow by applying dehydrated zeolite material to the bleeding site in order to induce hemostasis through dehydration of the wounded area and induction of a blood clot formation. The major disadvantage of this technique is the excessive heat generated at the injured site. There is an urgent need to minimize the heat generated by the hemostatic materials upon contact with blood. Of particular interest are such hemostatic compositions that can be rapidly and safely applied in an emergency situation, such as on the battlefield or at the scene of an accident, without the need for intense training or equipment. Advantages include reduced amount of heat generated by the hemostatic agent, improved blood-clotting efficiency (it is able to stop an arterial hemorrhage), easy to apply, even in an emergency situation, and the hemostatic agents can be packaged in a medical gauze, providing a simple and cost effective device.

    "ip_description": "A homogeneous composition of oxide materials prepared to modulate hemostasis and facilitate the blood coagulation, accelerating bone generation and assisting in wound healing and tissue repair. Treatment of severely bleeding wounds can require immediate attention to bring the bleeding under control. Severe bleeding poses a very real risk of death to the casualty if not treated quickly. When a laceration or penetrating trauma (e.g., knife or gun wound) is severe enough or involves critical arteries or veins, the bleeding must be slowed immediately or irreversible damage to organs and mortality can result. In recent years, scientists have attempted to reduce blood flow by applying dehydrated zeolite material to the bleeding site in order to induce hemostasis through dehydration of the wounded area and induction of a blood clot formation. The major disadvantage of this technique is the excessive heat generated at the injured site. There is an urgent need to minimize the heat generated by the hemostatic materials upon contact with blood. Of particular interest are such hemostatic compositions that can be rapidly and safely applied in an emergency situation, such as on the battlefield or at the scene of an accident, without the need for intense training or equipment. Advantages include reduced amount of heat generated by the hemostatic agent, improved blood-clotting efficiency (it is able to stop an arterial hemorrhage), easy to apply, even in an emergency situation, and the hemostatic agents can be packaged in a medical gauze, providing a simple and cost effective device. Applications include blood clotting and wound healing.",

UC Santa Barbara researchers have created a nonpolar III-nitride LED or LD that does not require any aluminum-containing cladding layers, because the quantum well active region is thick enough to function as an optical waveguide for the device. The exclusion of Al-containing waveguide layers allows for simpler epitaxial growth techniques, helps reduce problems with tensile strain and cracking in Al-containing waveguide layers, and creates higher crystal quality material. The elimination of Al-containing waveguide cladding layers allows for the fabrication of III-nitride-based LDs in the same way as III-nitride-based LEDs. Advantages: Higher crystal quality material, Lower threshold current densities, Reduced voltage operation, Longer lifetimes, Lower production costs.",

    "ip_description": "UC Santa Barbara researchers have created polarized white LEDs that can improve system efficiency by removing the need for an external polarizer. Alternatively, the color-rendering properties of these LEDs can be manipulated through use of a polarizing element. The color of the LED can be easily changed after it is produced by simply rotating the polarizing element. This allows an end user to adjust the LED to their preference for white light.\n\nAdvantages\n\n- Polarized white emission can reduce system complexity and cost\n- Hue of white light is tunable by end user after fabrication\n- Less costly and simpler than other white light LED manufacturing methods\n\nApplications\n\n- LEDs\n- Applications that require uniform color illumination such as display backlighting, two- and three-dimensional image projectors, and architectural lighting",

Researchers at UC Santa Barbara have developed a method to grow semipolar (Ga, Al, In, B)N thin films, heterostructures, and devices on suitable substrates or planar templates in which a large area of the semipolar film is parallel to the substrate surface. The method uses vapor phase epitaxy, such as metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), in order to grow the semipolar structures. Additionally, this technique alters the crystal growth orientation in order to reduce polarization effects in nitride thin films. This method is stable, energy efficient and cost-effective.",

UC Santa Barbara researchers have devised a solid state white lighting device consisting of a blue laser diode that emits light onto a single crystal phosphor, resulting in the emission of high-intensity white light. The single crystal phosphor absorbs some of the laser diode emission and emits a band of longer wavelength light. The combination of the remaining blue laser emission with the longer wavelength phosphor emission results in white light. Use of a single crystal phosphor allows for the emission of greater than 1100 lumens of white light without damage or degradation to the materials. This enables the replacement of a traditional incandescent light bulb with a single laser diode requiring much less epitaxial wafer area than common LED-based white light sources, which usually consist of 10-20 LEDs.",
