However, analysis of microbial genetics data has struggled to overcome the effects of false positive and false negative data. Computational methods are further constrained by inadequate benchmarking and the complexity of large datasets. To address these issues, improved experimental protocols and more robust analytical frameworks are needed to reliably identify tissue-resident microbial signals in human genomic data.\n\nRutgers researchers have developed Precise Identification of Species of Microbiome (PRISM), a computationally efficient method for decontamination and precise identification of microorganisms in genomic sequencing data. The purpose of PRISM is to identify taxa that are truly-present in the source sample and that are not falsely positive artifacts and contaminants. False-positive artifacts are taxa reported by taxonomic classifiers, but which are incorrectly classified; the reads assigned to these taxa did not originate from the reported taxa. Contaminant taxa are correctly identified, but these reads were not present in the source tissue; they were introduced during sample handling. PRISM thus has two key conceptual steps: (1) identifying correctly classified taxa and eliminating false positive artifacts, and then (2) distinguishing between truly-present vs. contaminating taxa. PRISM can facilitate microbiome analysis with a broad zone of confidence, enabling identification of microorganisms with significant molecular and clinical implications.\n\nMarket Applications:\n\u2022   Research tool to accurately identify biomarkers within the microbiome for a target disease / illness.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Decontaminate genomic sequencing data so that only truly present microbial species are identified.\n*   Novel algorithm for efficient, accurate, and precise microbial species identification.\n*   Novel machine learning model for prediction of contaminants.\n*   Model trained on curated dataset of 34,464 known true and false positive taxa.",

Over 40% of adults are overweight and over 15% of adults are living with obesity. Obesity is a major contributor to various causes of mortality including cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc. Recently, a series of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, such as semaglutide (Ozempic\u00ae) or tirzepatide (Mounjaro\u00ae), have shown great results for weight loss.

When proteins are sequestered in biomolecular condensates, they can be positioned closely enough for effective crosslinking. This approach offers a novel method for enzyme immobilization, as biomolecular condensates are permeable to small molecules, thereby circumventing the mass transfer limitations typically encountered with other immobilization techniques.

Cellular levels of these intermediates are heavily controlled by a key enzyme: phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP). Thus, PAP regulation is a key target for several metabolic disorders. Disruption of PAP may also be of use in inhibiting pathogenic fungal growth. Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor prescribed to humans for the treatment of depression and social anxiety disorders. The drug also exhibits antifungal activity but the basis of its action has been unclear.\n\nRutgers researchers have demonstrated the ability of sertraline to inhibit PAP activity in yeast and human liver cells with superior potency as compared to the leading PAP inhibitor \u2013 propranolol. This indicates that sertraline may have additional uses beyond treating psychiatric disorders.\n\nMarket Applications:\n*   Antimycotic therapy\n*   Potential anti-obesity therapy\n\nAdvantages:\n*   At least 2-fold increase in potency as compared to propranolol\n*   Inhibits yeast cell growth\n*   Previously untargeted mechanism of action enables combination approaches",

It is a valuable tool for detecting blood clots, tumors, structural defects, muscle performance, and heart size, among others, for men, women, and children. Moreover, there are no side effects, and it is a painless procedure. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, new advances in telemedicine for cardiology, specifically, tele-echocardiography, are entering the market. Additionally, point-of-care ultrasound for cardiology is spreading, which is also enhanced by these trends in tele-echocardiography. However, despite these advances, echocardiograms still require in-person patient visits to a clinic to receive an ultrasound to generate the echo. Researchers at Rutgers University have developed an advanced tele-echocardiogram platform that enables an electrocardiogram (ECG) to be performed to synthesize heart images, along with acquiring other vital signs by the patient via a smartphone, without going to a clinic. The technology combines artificial intelligence, mobile health technologies, and cardiology to enable the acquisition of images of the patient's heart and function. Market Applications: An integrated assessment of heart function using clinical and electrocardiographic (ECG) features to replace echocardiographic analysis. Use cases include identifying patient phenogroups at risk for major adverse cardiac events. Advantages: Can extract similar depth of data from ECG data than would traditionally require echocardiograms without requiring a patient to go to a clinic. Refined ECG-based risk stratification can provide a cost-effective strategy for classifying patients.",

Detection of peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2013) and nitrative stress in diverse lipid environments: biomimetic and biological membranes, lipid-rich organelles and tissues. The local concentration of redox agents (reactive nitrogen and oxygen species) is tightly regulated in cells to maintain homeostasis and prevent cell damage. Lipid membranes and lipid-rich organelles and tissues can be chemically damaged by reactive redox agents. Uncontrolled redox agent concentration and reactivity has been linked to neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. Direct detection of redox agents and monitoring oxidative and nitrative stress in lipid environments in cells and tissues is of major interest and a fundamental challenge yet to be addressed. Currently, known redox probes lack the ability to localize in membranes or have limited utility. To overcome these fundamental roadblocks, Rutgers researchers have developed lipid-based redox sensors that allow direct investigations of redox physiology in various lipid settings, including the lipid membranes in the form of giant vesicles, live mammalian cells, and the lungs. One particular lipid-based probe, named (DPPC-TC-ONOO\u2013), can localize in membranes and allows the detection of peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2013), a reactive nitrogen and oxygen species generated under nitrative stress.

Therefore, the resistance of the tunnel diode at the sharp negative differential resistance region provides a very sensitive signal for temperature measurement, which would theoretically allow nanokelvin-resolution thermometry with microscale footprint at room temperature.\n\nMarket Applications:\n*   TDES can improve sensitivity and resolution of existing calorimeters and bolometers by 1-3 orders of magnitude.\n*   TDES can used for probing chemical reactions, metabolism in single cells and biological systems, metrology of electronic and quantum systems, millimeter-wave/terahertz detection, thermal imaging and communication technology.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Compatible with commercially available microfabrication techniques and can be integrated on a microscale and nanoscale footprint.\n*   Ultra-high temperature resolution outperforming all other sensors with similar dimensions by 2-3 orders of magnitude.\n*   Electronic readout compatible with standard analog electronics which are both cost-effective, compact, and easy to integrate with other electronic components.\n*   Regarding uncooled microbolometers for thermal imaging, the proposed technology offers a 100-fold improvement in temperature coefficient of resistance of the sensing element, significantly reducing the noise floor for detection leading to enhanced sensitivity (i.e. enhanced noise equivalent temperature difference, NETD).",

The emergence of highly immune evasive SARS-CoV2 escape mutants require an immediate response from the scientific community to control breakthrough infections in COVID-19 vaccinated individuals and to limit the pathogenicity associated with infection in immunocompromised and elderly people. While the emergency authorization for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as prophylactic and therapeutic agents has significantly reduced the COVID-19 death burden in the latter populations, these therapies are no longer effective for the recently emerged highly resistant subvariants of Omicron (XBB.1.5, BQ.1, and BQ1.1) which now constitute 90% of new infections in the U.S. Because of the similar immune evasiveness and infectivity of BQ.1.1/BQ.1, and XBB.1.5, it is likely that these strains will coexist in the immediate future. Therefore, an mAb-based therapeutic that is capable of neutralizing current variants alone or in combination with other therapeutic mAbs is needed. Researchers at Rutgers University have recently identified a broadly reactive mAb that potently neutralizes a broad range of past and current variants, including the majority of the Omicron variants, at doses as low as 1 ng/ml. Variants neutralized by Rutgers mAb include the highly immune-resistant Omicron BQ.1 and BQ1.1 subvariants that currently contribute to 50% of infection in US (IC50s in the ng/ml range).

While electrostatic spray is an ideal solution and has been used to apply pesticides to plants for decades, the issue is that it has too high an electric current to directly water plants.\n\nThe invention describes a process of providing plant nutrients and water through electrospray deposition addressing this concern. Rutgers researchers have developed a one-plant-one-sprayer approach to water plants using electrospray deposition. The key invention is a holder for the growth media of the plants that isolate the plants from the current and electric field of the electrospray while allowing for the water and nutrients to transport. This is achieved by placing the plant media in a holder that redirects current, blocks field, and prevents root penetration. These innovations are integrated into several plant holder designs tuned to different high-efficiency plant growth scenarios.\n\n**Market Applications:**\n*   Vertical farming.\n*   Production of high value commodity crops in green houses and farms.\n*   Plant growth in space stations, long range space missions, or extraterrestrial habitats.\n\n**Advantages:**\n*   Reduction of overwatering and fouling.\n*   Better resource usage compared to aero/hydroponics.\n*   Capability for individualized plant care that can be integrated with AI approaches.\n*   Ideal where energy and computation are cheap while mass and recourses are expensive and cleaning is challenging (_e.g._, space).",

The design principle creates a pathway that can better guide magnetic flux and connect magnetic fields between transmitter and receiver coils. For quantifying technical benefits and economic feasibility, the WPT efficiency of partially magnetized pavement and conventional pavement was analyzed using numerical simulation of WPT system in the pavement.

Inner ear hearing damage is prevalent from recreational and occupational noise exposures, like music concerts, construction sites, factory settings, and military jobs. Such acoustic traumas are the cause of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) as it leads to injury of the hair cells in the inner ear by an increase of oxidative stress. Even with the present risk in a large portion of the population and its association with aging, there are no effective measures for long term prevention of NIHL.

However, generating synthetic data that accurately represents original data and preserves missing data has been a challenge.

Damage to the GI tract can arise from cancer therapies, like radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as inflammatory diseases. To improve the symptoms of GI tract injury, tissue transplantation/grafting is often considered, and the first clinical trials for organoid transplants began last year. GI transplants are expected to be a major clinical advance in the coming years, however, there is a need to improve the efficiency of transplantation in order to bring organoid transplant technology more rapidly and efficiently to patients. Rutgers researchers have developed a novel method for improving the transplantation of epithelial cells to the damaged GI tract.

These findings offer a potential method for improving grafting capacity of organoids, specifically in the context of GI epithelia.

These methods are intrusive, costly, require direct contact with the patient and can only obtain one single vital sign information at a time. To overcome these problems, devices were developed to use radio frequency (RF) signals for contact-less vital sign monitoring. However, these devices operate at fixed frequencies, and thus have limited ability to disentangle echo signals from targets at different ranges. Such limitation precludes their use in health monitoring of multiple individuals.\n\nRutgers researchers have designed and implemented a time- division multiplexing (TDM) phased-MIMO radar sensing system that allows high precision vital sign monitoring of multiple subjects. By utilizing frequency-modulated continuous-waveform (FMCW) techniques, the system can separate individuals at different radial distances. The sensing system can steer a signal beam towards the desired directions with a micro\u2010second delay and the steerable beam enables capturing the vital signs of multiple individuals at the same radial distance to the radar. A virtual array with larger aperture can be constructed providing a higher angular resolution.

    "ip_description": "Malaria is one of the most impactful diseases in tropical and subtropical regions and is transmitted through human contact with infectious mosquitoes. Crop pests create a large economic and social impact through direct damage to plants and spread of pathogens. Some estimates suggest a single pest, corn rootworm, causes $1 billion in damage annually in the U.S. alone. Methods to combat insect pests have primarily relied on pesticide applications which have off-target impacts, lead to resistance formation, and must be constantly applied. Even novel approaches such as sterile insect techniques are limited in their scope because of the persistent releases required for effectiveness and the potential for resistance formation. Rutgers researchers have developed a potential permanent solution to persistent pest control issues by developing a system for genetic modification which could reduce the transmission of vector borne diseases (like malaria) from their insect vectors, or to establish expression of a desirable trait such as Bacillus thuringiensis susceptibility in crop pests. The inventors have demonstrated their solution through a transgenic construct that expresses an anti-malaria peptide in Anopheles gambiae alongside piRNAs which are designed to direct silencing towards a host gene required for reproduction. If the host silences the genetic construct, this silencing will be directed towards the host gene resulting in infertility. This platform can be used to create a gene drive that can prevent resistance formation and allow for rapid spread of a trait within a population. Advantages: Agricultural pest control, Reduction of disease transmission, Genetic modification of target species. Market Applications: Permanent solution to modify the biology of insect pests to reduce or eliminate their negative impact, Reduce the need for harmful pesticides.",

Without proper treatment, a substantial proportion of chlamydia-infected women may develop infertility and other health problems. To date, no Chlamydia vaccine is available. Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular bacterium with a unique developmental cycle consisting of two cell types: the infectious but non-proliferative elementary body (EB) and the proliferative but noninfectious reticulate body (RB). Successful chlamydial infection requires all the following four sequential events: 1) EB invasion of host cells, 2) EB conversion to RB, 3) RB replication, and 4) conversion of RBs back to EBs. Rutgers researchers have identified a protein that is essential for the last step of the developmental cycle. They have devised an expression system that can precisely control the expression of this essential protein in chlamydiae. Using this system, they show that chlamydiae deprived of this protein can invade host cells and form proliferative RBs but fail to mature into progeny EBs. Because RBs contain all immunogens needed to elicit immune responses, the maturation-defective chlamydiae can be used as attenuated Chlamydia vaccines. Advantages: Complete attenuation of any Chlamydia species and serovars, Mucosal immunity elicited with topical immunization.

To do this, features of the disorders must be first noted by parents or guardians during daily lives and then brought into attention of the pediatrician. However, because of the latency in motor skill development, it is difficult to diagnose these conditions early in childhood. Moreover, these disorders are often exhibited in mild manners, making it difficult to diagnose. Researchers at Rutgers University have identified auditory brainstem response (ABR) readings as novel biomarkers for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders in neonates. The team mapped the stochastic fluctuations of ABR tests in the resting state across different neonates at birth. These were followed longitudinally, and some received autism diagnosis by 4 years old. Unambiguous differences were present at birth in babies whose neurodevelopment deviated from typical signatures. The team further supported their findings by associating this new map with neuromotor assessment and genomic data. Altogether, this technology provides a new approach for evaluating the neurodevelopmental health in neonates and a set of genes that could be used as a diagnostic battery at early stages of the disorder.

However, given the intrinsic inconvenience of conventional cuff- or tonometry-based blood pressure monitors, less than 30% of patients with a BP monitoring device at home measure their BP more than twice a day. There is hence a need for a more convenient, cuff-less alternative, which enables automatic and distraction-free BP monitoring.\n\nResearchers at Rutgers University developed a novel data-driven method for rapid and user-friendly cuff-less photoplethysmogram (PPG)-based BP estimation. This is the first method that proposes to create images from PPG signals via visibility graph (VG) for the purpose of estimating BP via transfer learning from image classification networks. Once the lightweight transfer learning model is trained, it gives estimates of BP from PPG input of duration less than 2 sec. Using the University of California Irvine (UCI) database consisting of 348 records, the proposed method achieves a best error performance of 0.00 \u00b1 8.46 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP), and 0.04 \u00b1 5.36 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP).\n\nAdvantages:\n\nLow computation budget\nComputationally fast: \u2264 2 sec raw PPG signal and <50 msec computation time once the model is trained\nOnly PPG as input\nMarket Applications:\n\nNon-invasive continuous BP monitoring for patients with:\n\nHypertension\nCardiovascular disease\nSpinal cord injury (SCI)\nHome BP monitoring\nSmart watches\nFitness Trackers\nIntellectual Property & Development Status: Patent pending.

Researchers at Rutgers have developed a 3D organoid that accurately mimics liver cell phenotype, function, and metabolism of the adult human liver. Optimal growing conditions of adult human primary liver cells in hepatic organoid cultures using combinations of growth factors and small molecules were devised. By limiting TGFb inhibition and incorporating Forskolin and Oncostatin M, the group demonstrated the extended expansion of primary liver cells from adult donors into functional organoids secreting albumin and displaying metabolic competence. The system can help researchers and drug companies use and expand primary human liver cells to assess drug metabolism and liver functions.

Neurointerventionalists, interventional radiologists, cardiologists, and vascular surgeons often can have difficulties using the commonly used Simmons catheter or any other double curve or a diagnostic angiography catheter for endovascular interventions for neurological/ peripheral vascular or cardiac disorders. This catheter tends to herniate back into its parent vessel (arch of the aorta or descending aorta or their branches) more so, in tortuous vessels rather than advancing forwards along the artery of interest. Rutgers researchers are near to completing the designing of a modified Simmons/ other double curve/ diagnostic angiography catheter to perform brain/ cardiac or peripheral vascular interventions. The new catheter will be anchored to allow it to be stable and thereby prevent it from herniating. Once the catheter is stable, surgeons can advance the guidewire distally to gain purchase to the distal artery of interest. Once the internal carotid artery/other arteries of interest are accessed and supported, the anchor can be removed, and the catheter can be advanced for interventions as intended. This is more helpful as the radial approach is becoming more commonly used for neurointerventions. This catheter can make access to the left vertebral artery through the right radial artery feasible. Balloon occlusion tests can be performed without needing a guide and a micro balloon catheter making the procedure more economical. Market Applications: Endovascular procedures. Mechanical thrombectomy for stroke. Aneurysm coiling. Arteriovenous malformations embolizations. Balloon test occlusion. Advantages: Stable placement of the catheter in the tortuous blood vessels.

There is no good cure for EBS, and treatment typically involves preventive and/or supportive care to protect skin from painful blistering. Researchers from Leipzig and Rutgers Universities have shown that keratinocytes from patients with EBS are protected from injury by the multi-kinase inhibitor PKC412. Treatment with PKC412 improves epithelial sheet integrity of EBS-associated keratinocytes harboring the severe keratin 14 Arg125-to-Cys mutations (K14.R125C) and K14.R125G and reduces their associated keratin aggregation. To further substantiate the efficacy of PKC412 on EBS-associated keratinocytes quantitatively, the researchers performed real-time impedance spectroscopy measurements. Upon PKC412 treatment, EBS keratinocytes showed a significant increase in impedance readings in a concentration-dependent manner. The overall findings provide a potential approach for targeted treatment of EBS.

The PWV (pulse wave velocity)-BP models, describing the relationship between the PWV and the BP, have been derived and used in recent BP-estimation studies. However, currently, there exist no toolboxes and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that enable pre-processing, visualization and analysis of signals for the problem of BP estimation.\n\nRutgers researchers have developed PulseLab, a comprehensive MATLAB toolbox that enables estimating the BP from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals using pulse PWV-based models. This universal framework consists of 6 sequential modules, covering end-to-end procedures that are needed for estimating BP from raw PPG/ECG data.

    "ip_description": "Motivation: Extrusion-based 3D printing of polymer- or polymer-composite parts can realize new applications in metamaterials, batteries, energy, and robotics. Limitations of existing printing methods: Current extrusion-based 3D printing methods increase throughput by increasing line width and thus cannot resolve complex features (Fig. A). Overprinting and machining prevent creation of complex geometries, like 3D metamaterials, due to limited geometric access while machining (Fig. B). Multiplexed printing with conventional toolpaths is confined to repeating geometries (Fig. C) or is throughput-limited to 3-4 extruders when using one robot arm per extruder due to collision issues (Fig. D). This systemic throughput-complexity-resolution tradeoff limits scalable lab-to-product translation for above applications. Our Innovation: Rutgers researchers have created MF3 to address this issue. MF3 uses an extruder array (Fig. E) with a fixed inter-extruder distance mounted on a single gantry or robot. A novel toolpath technique prints multiple sections of a part simultaneously, much like an inkjet printer. Unlike similar existing machines each section has a distinct geometry. Advantages: MF3 achieves high geometric complexity since non-repeating section geometries enable 3D parts (Fig. F), > 90% build time reduction due to multiplexing, and high feature resolution since each extruder uses a nozzle of small diameter. Using one gantry/robot and fixed inter-extruder distance avoids collisions. Using existing hardware and the ability to retrofit existing FFF machines simplifies the supply chain and reduces adoption cost. The sections have beneficial effects on the part\u2019s mechanical properties.

Concerns about the safety and reliability of gusset plates have been brought up to the bridge community after the collapse of the I-35W Bridge in Minneapolis in 2007. An essential aspect to ensure public safety as well as property, load rating analysis of existing gusset plates, needs to be appropriately established.\n\nA team led by Hani Nassif, along with Peng Lou and Chan Yang at Rutgers Infrastructure Monitoring Evaluation Group (RIME) developed a software engineering tool to load rate the truss bridge gusset plates.

The toeholds which are small single\u2010stranded DNA overhangs, are often utilized in kinetically controlled complex biochemical circuits. Existing toehold mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reactions rely on spontaneous annealing and strand exchange reaction These reactions are typically slow and thereby limiting many applications. There is a need for a catalyst to speed up these reactions but till date there are no catalyst currently used in such TMSD reactions. Rutgers researchers have discovered that human mitochondrial DNA helicase \u2018Twinkle\u2019 can catalyze TMSD reactions on various DNA substrates. Twinkle catalyzed strand displacement discriminates single base changes, and thus, can be utilized for developing diagnostic probes for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms. The researchers employed fluorescence based stopped-flow kinetics and electrophoretic methods to investigate these possibilities. Presence of Twinkle increased the amplitude and rate of the fluorescence signal, showing that Twinkle can accelerate the spontaneous TMSD reaction anywhere between 10-100 folds.

Researchers at Rutgers University proposed novel transmission architectures to enhance PHY security through the utilization of metamaterial (MTM) leaky-wave antennas (LWA). The secure schemes are devised to accomplish the functionalities of 1D and 2D directional modulation (DM) transmitters for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and non-contiguous (NC) OFDM transmissions, while enjoying the implementation benefits of MTM-LWAs. Specifically, they have for the first time put forth transmitter architectures based on the idea of time-modulated MTM-LWA as a promising solution for PHY security. A prototype of time-modulated array (TMA) containing MTM-LWAs was designed and developed, in which both simulated and measured results for the bit-error-rate (BER) show that the proposed MTM-TMA can preserve the signal in desired directions while distorting it in all other angles in 2D space. Numerical simulations show that even when an adversary employs sophisticated state-of-the-art deep learning-based attacks, the proposed transmission schemes are resistant to these attacks and reliably guarantee system security. Advantages: Provides compact, integrated, and cost-effective antenna architectures. No processing overhead required as would be needed for encryption-based security. Two-dimensional beam steering.

    "ip_description": "Within Dynamic window approach (DWA) systems, the agent lacks a mechanism that actively avoids collision when all its projected velocities are deemed inadmissible. While this passive approach ensures that the chosen velocities are collision-free, it may result in the agent coming to a complete stop if no admissible velocities are available, causing rear-end collisions. Rutgers researchers have developed an algorithm that introduces an active mechanism based on the mobility of moving obstacles within each control to avoid collisions. This method assesses the mobility of a moving obstacle by analyzing its translational acceleration and deceleration capabilities. Mobility of the obstacle within the upcoming control cycle is extended into a projected time, allowing for the identification of the admissible velocity of the agent at each control cycle. Collision-free results are demonstrated through two case studies including an open space navigation and a merging lane navigation through the comparisons with the DWA based on the trajectory prediction. Market Applications: Autonomous wheelchair navigation, Hands-free control for individuals with paralysis or quadriplegia, Enhanced safety features for manual and powered wheelchairs, Collision avoidance for moving robots in various industries, Smart navigation for autonomous forklift trucks in warehouses and factories.

While the glass industry has always strived to design a \"hard\" and \"crack-resistant\" glass, it has been generally accepted by glass scientists that it is hard to achieve both these properties in the oxide glasses. Recent literature in the glass space revealed that a hard and crack resistance glass can be obtain using a Al2O3 \u2013 SiO2 binary system. However, to synthesize such composition of glass requires high melting temperatures (>1800 \u05afC) and thus the synthesized glasses can only be produced in small shapes and dimensions.

Researchers indicate that RifaAAPs comprise the core pharmacophore of rifampin (Rif; a first-line anti-TB drug that binds to the mycobacterial RNA polymerase active center and sterically blocks RNA synthesis) covalently linked to an N\uf061-aroyl-N-aryl-phenylalaninamide (AAP; a proprietary synthetic anti-TB agent that binds to a different site on mycobacterial RNA polymerase and allosterically blocks RNA synthesis).

As a result, RifaAAPs overcome Rif-resistance and overcome AAP-resistance. As a further result, RifaAAPs exhibit much lower--orders of magnitude lower--resistance emergence than Rif and AAP. RifaAAPs potently inhibit Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA polymerase, exhibit potent in vitro antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria--including drug-susceptible, drug-resistant, and multidrug-resistant strains--and exhibit potent in vivo efficacy in oral treatment of mouse Mycobacterium tuberculosis acute infection and mouse Mycobacterium tuberculosis chronic infection (ED = 12.5 mg/kg PO).

Ethylene is a microbe-produced hormone that stimulates plant cell growth. However, in excess, ethylene causes stress in plants due to overproduction of superoxide, a highly potent form of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, the excess ethylene causes plant cells to produce superoxide, resulting in increased oxidative stress in plants that leads to plant death. Rutgers researchers have developed a natural herbicide composition that kills undesirable plants by causing normally beneficial endophytic microbes (bacteria and fungi) that naturally inhabit plant cells and tissues (roots and shoots) to overgrow and overproduce ethylene. The herbicide consists of a mixture of components that is dissolved or suspended in water and applied to plants with a sprayer. Microbes may be added to the mixture and applied to plants to increase the speed and thoroughness of herbicidal activity. The herbicide is not harmful to the environment; instead, it may function as a soil fertilizer by stimulation of degradation of weeds by endosymbiotic fungi that release nutrients from standing weed material to the soil where crop plants may access the nutrients, and stimulation of the soil microbiome that grow on components of the herbicide and release additional soil nutrients that may be absorbed by crop plants.

Large-size DNN models cause high storage and computational demands and many DNN model compression methods, such as tensor decomposition are used to reduce it. However, compression of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Tensor Train (TT) based decomposition causes significant loss of accuracy. Researchers at Rutgers University developed a method of TT-based model compression by applying Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) that causes minimal loss of accuracy. In this process, they train the DNN model in its original structure, decompose the uncompressed model to TT format, and then fine-tune it to get high accuracy. The framework is very general, and it works for both CNNs and RNNs and can be easily modified to fit other tensor decomposition approaches. The framework was evaluated on different DNN models for image classification and video recognition tasks. Experimental results show that the ADMM-based TT-format models demonstrate very high compression performance with high accuracy. Notably, on CIFAR-100, with 2.3\u02c6 and 2.4\u02c6 compression ratios, the models have 1.96% and 2.21% higher top-1 accuracy than the original ResNet-20 and ResNet-32, respectively.

Clinical manifestations of CEP include bone fragility, severe photosensitivity, and photo-mutilation. Currently there is no specific treatment for CEP, except bone marrow transplantation. Researchers at Rutgers University have shown that fluorescent porphyrins cause protein aggregation that interferes with protein function, and consequently cellular function. They have found that uro-I accumulation leads to protein aggregation and CEP-related bone phenotype, and have developed a zebrafish model that phenocopies features of CEP. As in human patients, uro-I accumulated in the bones of zebrafish, leads to impaired bone development. In an osteoblast-like cell line, uro-I decreased mineralization, aggregated bone matrix proteins, activated endoplasmic reticulum stress and disrupted autophagy. Using high-throughput drug screening, the researchers have identified acitretin, a second-generation retinoid, that reduces uro-I accumulation and its deleterious effects on bones. Another retinoid, tretinoin showed porphyrin clearance in zebrafish.

Invention Summary: Biophysical cues mediated by natural or synthetic extracellular matrices (ECMs) play an essential role in cellular reprogramming. In nature, ECM is structurally complex, spanning a wide range of sizes and hierarchical topographies. However, biomaterials (e.g., hydrogels and nanofibers) used as a synthetic ECM for cellular reprogramming are often designed at a reduced complexity, leading to suboptimal cell-ECM models. To address the aforementioned issues, Rutgers researchers have developed a Dynamic Interference Lithography (DIL) and applied the DIL to generate combinatorial ECM libraries with 104-106 unique structural elements for systematically investigating cell-ECM interactions. Further, a quantitative and predictive biophysical cue mapping and assessment approach has been developed to provide insight into ECM-directed cell behaviors such as proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and axonal growth by integrating machine learning-based analytics. In short, the approach has been implemented and new ECM structures have been discovered for efficient reprogramming of fibroblasts into mature neurons within a short time frame. Advantages: Capable of manufacturing large-scale, comprehensive, and indexable micro/nanoarrays in a highly cost-effective manner. Highly scalable and reproducible.

The MRI followed by voxel-by-voxel analysis of scans showed that the vector makes it possible to differentiate HER2+ from HER2- cancer lesions in mouse lungs. The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is overexpressed in different cancers and has been used as an important biomarker for aggressive tumors with metastatic potential. Currently in clinic, cancer diagnosis includes whole body imaging using computed tomography (CT) and/or positron emission tomography (PET). However, these imaging methods do not provide information regarding the presence or absence of cancer-specific cell surface biomarkers such as HER2. Therefore, a sensitive non-invasive HER2-specific imaging method is needed to provide such information. Rutgers scientists have invented a novel modular vector platform that can be used for cancer diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of response to different therapy for cancer treatment. The recombinant vector is a targeted system comprised of a single-domain antibody against HER2 for targeting fused to a highly soluble peptide to extend its half-life. The vector is labeled with gadolinium (Gd) to make it suitable for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In in vivo models, this system allows the visualization of HER2+ lesions of ovarian cancer lung metastasis by MRI. This vector also shows a high affinity toward HER2, long blood circulation time, and high signal-to-noise ratio of detection. Due to its ability to detect HER2+ cancer lesions, it can be used to facilitate tumor visualization, HER2 diagnosis, and targeted therapy.

Rutgers Researchers have identified molecular pathways and their read-out genes as markers of tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer patients. Through the association of pathway activity and response to tamoxifen, five biological pathways were identified as markers of tamoxifen resistance and research demonstrated their ability to predict the risk of tamoxifen resistance in two independent patient cohorts.

However, their sensitivity to blockage and severe signal attenuation present challenges in their deployment in urban settings. Current solutions to this dilemma are resource demanding and introduce network latency. Rutgers scientists have introduced a novel relay beamforming approach for mmWave communications in an urban scenario. The system model consists of static relays deployed in clusters across streets. It uses a novel, resource efficient scheme for joint optimal relay selection implemented in a predictive and distributed manner, and optimal distributed cooperative beamforming. This technique exploits the shadowing-induced correlation structure of the channel to predict the channel in time and space, thus reducing both latency and Channel State Information (CSI) overhead that is typically involved in relay selection. The simulations verified that the invention outperform any randomized selection policy, while, at the same time, achieves comparable performance to an ideal selection scheme that relies on perfect CSI estimates for all candidate relays. Advantages: Optimal performance: Comparable to an ideal selection scheme relying on perfect CSI estimates Increased communication range Improved security: few hops with few relay points Market Applications: Improved efficiency and security in the applications in the field of: Vehicle to vehicle communications in a city, vehicle to infrastructure, vehicle to everything or communications within some industrial site.

Although the prevalence of malaria has decreased steadily over the last two decades, progress has stagnated in recent years due to the emergence of drug-resistant malarial strains. These adapted infections are the focus of current anti-malarial research efforts. Rutgers researchers have identified a new class of Naphthyridine Carboxamide based anti-malarial small-molecule inhibitors that are as potent as current therapeutics and act through a new mechanism. In-vitro assays against human blood cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum show toxicities in the single-digit nanomolar range, and tolerance studies in human hepatocytes show no toxicity at 3 orders of magnitude above therapeutic concentrations. Similar assays conducted using common drug resistant mutant malarial strains showed no difference in efficacy, suggesting a new and hitherto unidentified pathway for malarial cytotoxicity. Current treatments and newly developed drugs inhibit malarial growth through molecular targets that have long been established and will continue to be steadily rendered less effective by evolving resistant Plasmodium strains. This novel class of small molecules shows strong efficacy against standard and resistant parasite varieties and is a promising candidate for new anti-malarial therapeutics.

    "ip_description": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic idiopathic disorders causing inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with a high prevalence rate. Specific and effective treatments for these diseases are limited. There is a clear need for therapy to treat inappropriate inflammatory responses in GI tissues, specifically by restoring normal immune regulation. A subtype of T cells - regulatory T cells (Tregs) - reside in the GI tissues have a key role in preventing unwanted immune responses, maintaining immune homeostasis and tissue-specific tolerance, and aid in balancing the gut microbiota.\n\nRutgers researcher, Derek Sant\u2019Angelo, has discovered a subset of Tregs cells that is necessary for maintaining the barrier functions of the intestine and for controlling intestinal inflammatory disease. The CD4+ Tregs, were identified by their unique expression of the BTB-ZF transcription factor Zbtb20. Like other members of the BTB-ZF family, Zbtb20, is the \u201cmaster regulator\u201d of the unique effector functions of these T cells. Zbtb20-expressing Tregs accumulate in the intestine, specifically proliferate in response to epithelial damage and are essential for protecting the colon against inflammation. A key finding was that adoptive transfer of small numbers of Zbtb20-expressing Tregs was sufficient to protect the intestine from inflammation. Importantly, conventional T cells transduced with Zbtb20 acquire the functions and phenotype of the naturally occurring Tregs. These modified T cells, therefore, are expected to be effective as an adoptive T cell immunotherapy for treatment of IBD related diseases. Furthermore, monitoring the frequency of ZBTB20 expressing T cells in people may be predictive of susceptibility to disease.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n- Novel Treg subset and its highly effective GI immune functions\n- Key regulator of immune homeostasis in GI mucosa\n- Tested in mice, can be evaluated in clinical settings\n- Selective control of Treg function via gene transduction\n\nMarket Applications:\n\n- Immunotherapy treatment method for inflammatory diseases\n- Cell transfer therapy for treatment of IBD\n- Method to assess risk of developing an inflammatory disease",

An autonomous vehicle or robot must be able to follow a clear path towards its destination by anticipating the imminent behavior of moving obstacles and computing a safe driving path. Researchers at Rutgers have invented a safe, and reliable collision avoidance system for robots and autonomous vehicles, which can sense and avoid obstacles accurately. The system provides better results and is faster than other solutions. The navigation system calculates a safe and collision free velocity, that can control the movement of a robot or an autonomous vehicle and helps it to avoid any obstacle as it navigates towards its destination in a dynamic environment. The proposed collision detection system can generate reachability and safety indexes for all potentially acceptable next step motions. More specifically, it builds upon an existing velocity obstacle algorithm, to check whether a motion will lead to a collision or not. Advantages: Fast, does not require use of computationally expensive processes (such as artificial intelligence/neural networks, optimization, sampling, or other decision-based approaches) for computing collision-free paths. The algorithm does not need any training process to tune parameters. Testing has shown that 100% collision free conditions can be designed for autonomous vehicles or robots.

Since there is no FDA approved drug for NAFLD or NASH treatment, there is an urgent need to develop a novel and effective therapy. Kisspeptins are peptides that circulate in the blood and bind KISS1R receptors. Scientists from the Rutgers University discovered that increasing KISS1R signaling by administration of the kisspeptin analog (TAK-488) in obese wild type insulin-resistant mice improves insulin resistance, protects against excess fat build-up in the liver (known as fatty liver or steatosis), lowers liver and serum triglycerides, and lowers serum free fatty acids.

    "ip_description": "Phebox ligands are organic complexes useful for a number of catalytic transformations of other organic molecules, including transformations of alkanes generally requiring harsh conditions. Since catalytic transformations using this class of ligands intrinsically involve the activation of C-H bonds, the degradation of the phebox ligand via reactions of the C-H bonds of the aryl position (benzylic or aryl C-H bonds) is potentially problematic. Rutgers researchers have developed the bis-CF3-Phebox ligand and its non-obvious preparation method. The ligand can be complexed with metals to yield stable, convenient-to-synthesize, and highly effective catalysts. Therefore, the aryl positions can be protected with -CF3 groups. A multi-step synthesis of bis-CF3-Phebox has been successfully achieved and the bis-CF3-Phebox was used as an iridium complex in the alkane dehydrogenation of n-decane and n-dodecane with high catalytic turnover numbers. Advantages: Novel, highly effective, and non-obvious catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation. Novel and convenient synthesis to the catalyst.

To better reconstruct high-quality images and investigate the relationship between reconstruction and segmentation, Researchers at Rutgers University have developed a joint method for MRI that focuses on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning for the reconstruction of images of the heart and cardiac segmentation. Machine learning based methods jointly learn to reconstruct images from dynamic k-space data (subset of data from MRI) and to generate segmentation masks. Our solution is comprised of three novel techniques: Reconstruction using a channel-wise attention network model that can attend to salient information by filtering irrelevant features and also concentrates on high-frequency information by enforcing low-frequency information bypassed to the final output. Motion-guided dynamic reconstruction that utilizes deep neural networks with motion information to improve reconstruction quality to decompose the motion-guided optimization problem of dynamic MRI reconstruction into three components: dynamic reconstruction, motion estimation and motion compensation. A joint solution to the inverse problem in medical imaging that takes as input the under sampled k-space data and outputs the reconstructed images and the segmented myocardium. (Currently k-space data is transformed into a reconstructed MRI image and after manual intervention, the myocardium contours are extracted using segmentation.) Our solution performs reconstruction and segmentation simultaneously using a novel deep learning approach which consists of a reconstruction module derived from the fast-iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) and a segmentation module.

However, the implants require batteries which need to be replaced on a regular basis through surgery, introducing extra complications, cost and risk. Rutgers researchers have developed a system comprised of software-hardware for far-field wireless power transfer to charge a medical implant residing in deep tissue of a humans. The novel technology is able to continuously charge the medical implant by using near-optimal beamforming power and is able to charge even when the implant moves in the body. The technology uses a unique energy ball pattern of distributed antenna array and backscatter-assisted beamforming algorithm that concentrates RF energy on a tiny spot surrounding the medical implant.

Responses to routine OASIS questions are entered into a mathematical model to generate a dementia risk prediction score.\n\nMany older adults living with dementia are undiagnosed. An estimated 40% of community-dwelling older adults with probable dementia are undiagnosed (Amjad, Roth, Sheehan, Lyketsos, Wolff & Samus, 2018).

(B) Survival of mice bearing PDX TM00089 tumors following treatment with vehicle (black line) and NC5 (red line). The Crk family of adaptor proteins are important as key players in tumorigenesis and immune responses. Phosphorylation of Crk proteins prevents the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and promotes the metastasis of tumors. Although the involvement and mechanism of how Crk is involved in cancer is well-characterized, there are no drugs that specifically target Crk proteins in cancer immunotherapy. Rutgers researchers have identified a novel, chemically optimized compound that has the capacity to modulate Crk activation and, therefore, its activity. By filtering through several libraries of compounds, the researchers identified-NC5 and its optimized analogs based on its specific action on Crk and Crk-like (CrkL) but not upstream enzymes. The inventors confirmed the capacity of NC5 as a novel cancer therapeutic through a combination of in vitro assays and mouse models with cell-derived xenografts (CDX) and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Their in vitro studies also show that NC5 treatment allows for proper immune response. Based on its capacity to block triple-negative breast cancer cell line (TNBC) proliferation and disease progression in in vivo models, NC5 and its optimized analogs show promise to be a novel therapeutic potential that targets the Crk pathway.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of cancer that starts in the liver. HCC is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. It causes 662,000 deaths worldwide per year. Currently, there is no effective CAR-based immunotherapy to treat HCC. This invention disclosed a new chimeric antigen receptor targeting a surface marker of hepatocellular carcinoma. NK cells transduced with such CAR effectively eliminated malignant hepatocellular carcinoma cells (including SK-Hep1, Huh7, HCO2, Hep3B, and HepG2 cell lines) and primary hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro. Two different xenograft models were used to evaluate whether the CAR-NK can be used to treat HCC in vivo. In the xenograft mouse model, mice receiving the CAR-NK cells were significantly protected from rapid progression of HCC and their median survival was prolonged (P < 0.0001), with comparable body weight among different groups. In the patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model of HCC, the median survival of mice treated with the CAR-NK cells was 63 days, which is significantly higher than that of control mice (median survival about 42 days, figure above). These data support the therapeutic potential of RU-CAR-NK or RU-CAR-T cells in patients with HCC.

Rutgers researchers discovered that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a naturally occurring cytokine, present in the intestinal stem cells and is critical in maintaining intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and regeneration. They highlight an unexpected role of LIF in protecting against radiation therapy-induced GI tract injury and GVHD development. Findings in mice suggest that LIF could protect the GI tract from injuries leading to: (1) 50% higher regeneration of intestinal epithelium after irradiation compared to controls, (2) less systemic symptoms such as weight loss, and (3) remarkably higher overall survival.

To increase awareness, identify research needs, and provide the basis for future work ISRNM has recommended the nomenclature of PEW and formulated a model that theorizes etiological factors which may negatively impact nutritional status and contribute to morbidity and mortality.\n\nThe ISRNM PEW model is based on a comprehensive synthesis of available research but fails to integrate the patient\u2019s perspective. Integrating the patient's voice into research prioritization is essential for solving problems that patients care the most about in terms of health, symptom management, and survival.

Drugs that target pre-erythrocytic stages are an essential component of the anti-malarial effort because a decrease in liver infection by sporozoites significantly reduces severity and incidence of malaria. Existing anti-malarial that target pre-erythrocytic stages, such as primaquine, tafenoquine and atovaquone, have significant side-effects or are expensive. Therefore, there is an acute need for novel drugs that target pre-erythrocytic stages. Rutgers researchers have chemically and biologically validated that P. falciparum cGMP dependent protein kinase (PfPKG) is required for the parasite\u2019s liver cycle in the pre-erythrocytic stage.

    "ip_description": "Using ScenarioNet to find high-level similarities and differences between two images. The ability for computational agents to reason about the high-level content of real-world scene images is important for many applications. For example, for many applications (e.g. robotics, human-machine teaming, surveillance, and autonomous vehicles), an agent must reason about the high-level content of real-world scene images in order to make rational, grounded decisions that can be trusted by humans. It is often also necessary to have models that can be interpreted by humans in order to further encourage trust and allow humans to understand the failure modes of the autonomous agent. For example, if a self-driving car makes an error, it is important to know what caused the error to prevent future situations where similar errors might arise. Researchers at Rutgers University have introduced \u201cScenarios\u201d as a new way of representing scenes in images. Useful for a wide range of scene understanding tasks, the scenario is an easy-to-interpret, low-dimensional, data-driven representation consisting of sets of frequently co-occurring objects. Scenarios are learned from data using a novel matrix factorization method which is integrated into a new neural network architecture, the \u201cScenarioNet\u201d. Using ScenarioNets, semantic information about real world scene images are recovered at three levels of granularity: 1) scene categories, 2) scenarios, and 3) objects. Training a single ScenarioNet model enables scene classification, scenario recognition, multi-object recognition, content-based scene image retrieval, and content-based image comparison. Use of this scene understanding technology enables recognizing scenes (e.g., in images and videos) as well as explaining the reasons for the recognition in a human-understandable form.

To trust the decisions made by these algorithms it is important for people to understand how they arrive at them. Researchers at Rutgers University have created a novel solution that uses Bayesian Teaching for explaining the decisions made by AI algorithms. Bayesian Teaching is a model-agnostic system that samples data subsets to explain model inferences to a domain (but not necessarily technical) expert. This solution allows a user to ask questions of a ML model (used by an AI Algorithm to make a decision) and in response it provides (e.g., displays) examples to explain the reasons for the decisions. For a use case, consider a user who wants to know why an AI algorithm in a self-driving automobile made a specific decision; our solution provides responses such as: \u201cin similar situations it was found that the reason for this decision were: \u201cexample reason 1\u201d, \u201cexample reason 2\u201d, etc. The examples might be in the form of displayed images or some other form relevant to the type of application/use.

    "ip_description": "A) Novel mechanism of action: a short exposure to ZMCs increases zinc levels in tumors enough to restore normal structure/function to mutant p53 which leads to p53 mediated cancer cell death. B) Novel formulation: Synthesizing ZMCs as a zinc-loaded complex (Zn-1) improves survival in a pancreatic cancer mouse model compared to the ZMC compound alone. More than half of all cancers harbor a mutation in the p53 gene which plays an essential role as a tumor suppressor. Restoring wild type p53 function has been shown to have potent anti-cancer activity and also improves the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Given the large number of cancer patients with p53 mutations, restoring the wild type structure and function of mutant p53 is a highly sought after goal in the development of cancer therapeutics. Rutgers scientists have developed a new class of mutant p53 reactivators called zinc metallochaperones (ZMCs). ZMCs have been identified as a novel approach for targeting specific p53 mutants with impaired zinc-binding by raising cellular zinc levels sufficiently to restore normal p53 structure/function and induce p53-mediated cancer cell death. This novel mechanism occurs quickly (within minutes) and is irreversible, so drug exposure time is minimal which reduces the potential for toxicity. Pre-clinical evidence in multiple models of breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer show that ZMC therapy is highly efficacious and specific for zinc-deficient mutant p53 tumors. Synthesizing ZMCs in complex with zinc is a novel formulation that improves efficacy over ZMCs alone. These ZMC-Zinc complexes have better drug-like properties (potency, solubility) to serve as pharmacologic lead molecules. Market Applications: Targeted anti-cancer drugs, Combination therapy with conventional cancer treatments. Advantages: Only brief ZMC exposure (<30 mins) is necessary for massive cancer cell death, ZMC complexes are rapidly cleared in vivo, New ZMC complexes have improved potency and lower toxicity.",

    "published_date": "6/30/2020",
    "ip_description": "There are many natural and human phenomena in the physical, biomedical, and social sciences that generate long-tailed asymmetric histograms (LTAH) that fit the Planckian Distribution Equation (PDE). It has been postulated that the Planckian process (defined as the physicochemical, socioeconomic, or cosmological processes that generate LTAH\u2019s fitting PDE) involves a selection mechanism that can identify as special a subset of events out of all possible randomly organized events. The Planckian Distribution Equation (PDE) was derived by Dr. Sungchul Ji at Rutgers University in 2008. PDE is based on the blackbody radiation equation discovered by M. Planck in 1900. It replaces the universal constants and temperature with free parameters A, B, and C, resulting in y=(A/(x+B)^5)/(Exp (C/(x+B)-1)), where x is the bin number and y is its frequency. PDE has been found to fit many long-tailed asymmetric histograms generated in diverse fields of investigations. Two numbers can be computed from the PDE that fits an LTAH: The Planckian information of the second kind, I_PS, and Shannon entropy, H. Each LTAH representing a function can be plotted as a point in the so-called Planck-Shannon plane (also called plot or graph) and a set of such points, when forming a linear regression line, represents a \u2018superstructure\u2019 with a function beyond the sum of the functions of the individual LTAH\u2019s. The Planck-Shannon classifier (PSC) is a software algorithm that can map three or more sets of LTAH\u2019s into one or more categories of functions, each category exhibiting a linearly correlated line on the Planck-Shannon plane. The classifier can take as inputs data sets that can be represented as LTAH\u2019s and classify the LTAH\u2019s into different categories. Examples of the areas of science and researches where the algorithm can be used to solve important problems include (i) protein folding, (ii) single-molecule enzyme catalysis, (iii) transcriptomics (e.g. distinguishing RNA concentration patterns between normal and cancer cells), (iv) genomics (i.e., the study of the totality of the genes in the cell), (v) fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), (vi) neuro-bioscience, (vii) psychometrics (e.g., decision-making time histograms), (ix) quantitative linguistics (or glottometrics), (x) econometrics (e.g., annual income distributions in the US), (xi) quantitative social-network analysis, and (xii) the polarized cosmic microwave background radiation data. From each of these fields, novel \u2018superstructures\u2019 can be discovered using the Planck-Shannon plot that may be associated with novel functions emerging from the interactions between well-established individual functions of the constituent LTAH\u2019s. Any experimental data sets that can be represented as LTAH\u2019s can be analyzed by plotting them on the Planck-Sahnnon plane as a set of points. These points can be classified into two groups \u2013 correlated and uncorrelated, the former constituting a \u2018superstructure\u2019 most likely with a novel function and the latter representing ordinary structures. The algorithm applies to any area of science or research that requires the analysis of long-tailed asymmetric histograms in terms of their possible underlying mechanisms and functions.",

    "ip_description": "Nrf2 is a key transcription factor mediating anti-inflammatory and antioxidant responses in the body. Keap1 is a well-known repressor of Nrf2 that targets Nrf2 for its rapid proteasomal degradation. Dysfunctional Keap1-Nrf2 axis contributes to oxidative stress and inflammation underlying multiple disease conditions, including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases, chronic kidney diseases (CKD) and diabetes. Therefore, Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction (PPI) is a promising therapeutic target for these diseases. However, earlier Keap1-Nrf2 modulators inhibit Keap1-Nrf2 PPI indirectly and irreversibly, which raises increasing concerns over their long-term toxicity in clinic. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the discovery of potent small molecule direct inhibitors of Keapl-Nrf2 PPI. Rutgers scientists have invented novel small molecule direct inhibitors of Keap-Nrf2 PPI. These inhibitors feature unique scaffolds and high potency as non-electrophilic Nrf2 activators. In in vitro models, the inhibitors induce the expression of Nrf2-controlled genes and proteins and exhibit better efficiency than such well-known Nrf2 activators as sulforaphane. Furthermore, pre-treatment with inhibitors protects cells against LPS-induced inflammatory responses, characterized by the altered cytokine levels. These new inhibitors show no obvious cytotoxicity in in vitro models. Due to their ability to inhibit Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interaction and activate Nrf2-mediated anti-inflammatory effect, these compounds can potentially be used to treat various oxidative stress-related diseases and conditions, including cancer, COPD, and neurological disorders.",

Researchers indicate that RifaAAPs comprise the core pharmacophore of rifampin (Rif; a first-line anti-TB drug that binds to the mycobacterial RNA polymerase active center and sterically blocks RNA synthesis) covalently linked to an N\uf061-aroyl-N-aryl-phenylalaninamide (AAP; a proprietary synthetic anti-TB agent that binds to a different site on mycobacterial RNA polymerase and allosterically blocks RNA synthesis). RifaAAPs inhibit mycobacterial RNA polymerase through two different binding sites (the Rif and AAP binding sites) and two different mechanisms (the Rif and AAP mechanisms). As a result, RifaAAPs overcome Rif-resistance and overcome AAP-resistance. As a further result, RifaAAPs exhibit much lower--orders of magnitude lower--resistance emergence than Rif and AAP.

Trust can be accomplished by enforcing (governing) electronically, a contract, policy, or another type of protocol to govern transactions among members. Rutgers researcher, Dr. Naftaly Minsky, has developed a novel control mechanism (\u201cCOP\u201d) that governs interactions among members of multi-agent distributed systems \u2014 which can include software processes, physical IoT devices, and people operating via diverse platforms\u2014and can enforce a wide range of protocols over such interactions. Such protocols may represent a contract that binds these actors, or it may be necessary for the actors to collaborate effectively on some common goal, or to compete safely over the use of resources. The COP mechanism is inherently decentralized, and it satisfies the following important qualities: (a) very low latency; (b) highly scalable; (c) supports interoperability between systems operating subject to different protocols, and can, thus be applied to systems-of-systems; and (d) is considerably secure. Recently, commercial, financial and healthcare applications implemented using blockchain-based smart contracts have garnered attention. This mechanism is quite secure, but its effective range of applications is limited due to constraints associated with latency, scalability, and limited interoperability.

The plume of the plasma containing pyrolyzed precursor is directed into and submerged in a bath of chilled, high purity water or other liquid, where condensation-quenching of vaporized species takes place, leading to the formation of graphene nanoflakes.

    "ip_description": "Rutgers University has been breeding eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin) since 1960. Rutgers oyster strains have shown strong to moderate resistance to two diseases (MSX and Dermo). Rutgers also invented tetraploid oysters (with 4 sets of chromosomes) and a new type of triploid oysters (with 3 sets of chromosomes) by crossing diploid and tetraploid oysters. Because of their sterility, superior growth, and improved summer meat quality, new triploid oysters developed by Rutgers have become an important part of the oyster aquaculture industry worldwide, accounting for 30-50% of oyster productions in the US and France. Continued research and development since 1998 have led to further improvement of Rutgers disease-resistant strains. Growth and shell shape have been improved through intensive selection. New genetic materials have been introduced through progressive rotational crossing. Two disease-resistant strains have been released to the oyster industry. One is the Rutgers HASKIN NEH\u00ae strain, which is derived from Northeastern populations and shows improved growth and survival throughout the Northeastern region. The other strain is the Haskin DBX strain that is derived from Delaware Bay populations and shows improved tolerance for medium and low salinity environments of lower Delaware Bay. Both disease-resistant strains show improved survival and growth compared with wild and susceptible oysters. New tetraploid lines have been developed from disease-resistant strains through selection and systematic interploidy breeding that combines genetic improvement from diploid, triploid and tetraploid phases. Triploids produced from the new and improved tetraploids are healthier and grow significantly faster than diploid oysters. Tetraploid broodstocks from both Haskin NEH and DBX are available for commercial triploid production. Strains available for release: Haskin NEH: diploids and tetraploids; Haskin DBX: diploids and tetraploids. Market Applications: Eastern oyster farming in estuary and coastal waters of mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. Advantages: Genetically improved oyster varieties for mid-Atlantic and Northeastern US waters. Diploid oyster strains with improved disease resistance, growth and diversity. Improved tetraploid lines for the production of 100% and improved triploids. Oyster broodstocks that produce uniform, faster growing, healthier and tastier oysters.",

Excessive delays not only inconvenience passengers, but also disrupt supply chains downstream the POE, often causing severe economic damage. In addition, they elevate carbon footprint resulting in environmental and public health impacts. US Custom and Borders Protection (CBP)\u2014a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014has been responsible for facilitating vehicular and pedestrian traffic so as to minimize crossing times without compromising security inspections. Accordingly, DHS has funded work on solutions that provide a flexible simulation environment and models of US POEs to analyze and optimize POE lane configurations and staff allocation with the aim of keeping waiting times as low as possible. Researchers at Rutgers University are part of a project team (funded by DHS) that is working on solutions for CBP. They have developed a modeling methodology and are developing a suite of detailed simulation models of POEs (the POESS simulation software) for computing performance metrics and studying hypothetical \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenarios. The project supports future planning of POE evolution (typically expansion and handling of traffic surges) and contains facilities, such as a dynamic editor and traffic animation, for flexibly studying hypothetical \u201cwhat-if\u201d issues such as changes in POE configurations and operating parameters, as well as disruptions in the form of road and plaza obstructions. POESS creates 3D and 2D simulation models layered over a realistic geographic map of the POE and its vicinity with animated traffic and dynamic statistics displays. The models are easy to use and readily understood by users and observers. Each simulation model serves as a decision support system (DSS) helping POE stakeholders analyze and optimize their POE operating decisions.

Early recognition and rapid eradication of exotic species can prevent detrimental ecological or economic effects. However, in terrestrial systems, this approach is often limited by the difficulty of detecting the invasive species early, while its population numbers are still low. To address this challenge, scientists at Rutgers have developed a method for surveilling terrestrial exotic species by aggregating environmental DNA (eDNA), which is contained in fragments (e.g., skin flakes, fecal matter, etc.) shed by individuals as they move about an environment. The novel technology describes the following strategy: (1) identify likely deposits of target eDNA (e.g. on fruiting bodies, plant surfaces, or in soil); (2) utilize an easily implementable method for aggregating the eDNA (e.g., sampling crop wash water); (3) concentrating the sample; and (4) extracting the target eDNA and utilizing a sensitive detection method (e.g., qPCR). The key = aggregation step significantly increases the likelihood of detecting species present at very low abundance.

    "ip_description": "The ideas for Polynomiography grew out of Dr. Bahman Kalantari\u2019s research into polynomial root-finding, an ancient and historic subject that continues to find new applications with each generation of mathematicians and scientists. The term \u201cpolynomiography\u201d, coined by Dr. Kalantari, is a combination of the word \u201cpolynomial\u201d and the suffix \u201cgraphy.\u201d A \"polynomiograph\" is an individual rendered image.\n\nPolynomiography is a fusion of math _and art_, which as software gives rise to a new form of abstract art. Rendered images are through algorithmic visualization of solving a polynomial equation via iterative methods. Images are beautiful and diverse, yet unique. The software inputs equations or point locations as roots of polynomial equations via a computer mouse. Locations can be arbitrary, or ones that form user\u2019s desired pattern.\n\nIn the latter case the software converts the points into a polynomial equation and then renders a polynomiograph. Because the input can be numbers, words, sentences, images (or any type of input that can convert into a polynomial) users do not need to understand the underlying mathematics of polynomials. The software includes filtering tools for manipulation of generated images.\n\n**Applications:**\n\n**Education:** Polynomiography has had positive feedback from presentations to hundreds of middle and high-school students. The software helps to increase students interest and excitement about learning mathematics and STEM.\n\n**Design:** The images generated by polynomiography can be the source for fabric, carpet or wall paper designs, as well as images imprinted on items of clothing, posters, postcards, business cards, logos, and promotional items.\n\n**Art:** Images rendered by the software become unique pieces of fine art when placed on canvas. Artists and designers can decide to further develop images. Art work that the software generates has been in US and International exhibitions.\n\n**Image Processing:** Many image and photo editing products allow users to add specialty tools (referred to as plugins) into the software. A polynomiography plugin adds the ability to generate polynomiographs as a feature of the underlying image processing software.\n\n**Security**: An interesting use of polynomiography is for the encryption of numbers such as ID numbers and credit card numbers into images that resemble a fingerprint. Different numbers exhibit different fingerprints.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nPolynomiography generates beautiful abstract works of art that are spectacular and diverse. The software has multiple potential uses and applications. It is a fantastic tool for education at all levels, from children to college level. For use in design it reduces costs by generating images instead of requiring the use of human designers.",

Typically, sound generating devices create pressure waves by mechanical deflection of electromagnetic or piezoelectric elements at discrete or limited resonant frequency bands. The deflecting elements in these devices deteriorate over time; a sound generator without these sensitive moving parts will lead to a more robust and broadband device. Researchers at Rutgers University have developed a new type of sound generator in the form of a transducer array capable of generating sound without the need for a vibrating solid object or membrane. This sound generator creates acoustic waves in fluid directly by harnessing the versatile frequency response of the electroosmotic effect.

    "ip_description": "Airway Hyperresponsiveness (AHR), a hallmark of asthma, represents exaggerated airway narrowing in response to contractile agonists such as acetylcholine. Human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) mediate AHR by shortening in response to contractile agonists. Inhibition of calcium sensitization pathways in human airway smooth muscle has been shown to be an effective method of inducing bronchodilation. Due to off target effects in vascular smooth muscle, however, clinical trials of bronchodilators targeting calcium sensitization pathways have been precluded. Accordingly, there is a strong need for alternative approaches to the clinical management of airway obstruction in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other inflammatory lung diseases. About 50% of asthma patients currently have uncontrolled symptom. This research approach may overcome the limitations of existing therapy. Rutgers scientists identified a novel target - G\u03b112 signaling - for relaxing human airway smooth muscle. This discovery demonstrates that G\u03b112 plays a crucial role in human airway smooth muscle contraction via RhoA-dependent activation of the PI3K/ROCK axis. In human asthma models, inhibition of G\u03b112 signaling serves as an effective and novel method of inducing bronchodilation, a clinically desirable outcome in asthma treatment. Targeting G\u03b112 signaling may elucidate novel therapeutic targets in asthma. In addition, inhibition of RhoA activation induces bronchodilation in human precision-cut lung slices. Taken together, these findings provide alternative approaches to the clinical management of airway obstruction in asthma, COPD, and any other inflammatory lung disease. Market Applications: Agents and method for therapeutic treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis and other inflammatory lung diseases.

    "ip_description": "Communication and language disorders occur in over 5% of the general population and estimates show them to be more prevalent in youth with psychiatric disorders that require psychiatric services. Early detection in young patients can improve treatment for the communication disorders (CDs) and the additional associated diagnoses. Comprehensive assessment of CDs is expensive, time-consuming, and is impractical in most clinical settings, particularly inpatient and most time-limited partial hospital programs. Self-report measures rarely focus upon CDs as a symptom, dimensional or categorical area of concern. Few if any self-report instruments provide data for CD screening exist. Researchers at Rutgers University have created the Communication Perception Estimate Scale (CoPES) to help identify undiagnosed communication disorders. CoPES is based on DSM-5 criteria for CDs and is a set of questionnaires that captures perceived and self-perceived communication difficulties in receptive- and expressive-language and in social (pragmatic) communication for youths between ages 11-18 years. CoPES is a 30-item scale structured to determine the extent of the following: Perception and self-perception of CDs (e.g., Present \u201cAlmost all of the time\u201d to \u201cNever\u201d or \u201cmaybe once or twice a week\u201d), Frustration or anger where CDs exist, Previous therapy for CDs (yes/no), Desire for help (or more help) to improve CDs. The audience for CoPES provide care for children and adolescents, particularly in the areas of health and social services. Examples include the following: mental health and pediatric clinics, programs offering pediatric mental health services including inpatient, and partial hospital programs, therapeutic day school and residential programs, doctors\u2019 offices and schools. Two hundred youths (ages 11-18 years) receiving psychiatric services in a restricted setting used an earlier CoPES self-report questionnaire. The conclusion of the study was that many youths in restrictive clinical settings report substantial CDs. Youths are aware and able to self-report. The scale appears to be psychometrically sound with a potential to provide a quick and reliable screen for CDs. Advantages: CoPES is a self-report instrument that focuses on and specifically collects CDs screening data, Has the potential to become a component of diagnosis for CDs and other disorders, Can help in the treatment of other disorders such as anxiety, depression ADHD, learning disabilities and autism.

A service may try to gain the trust of potential clients by making suitable promises, writing them on its website. But there is no good reason for potential clients to trust such promises of most services. This situation makes it very hard for the vast majority of services to compete with the few reputable ones. So many vendors opt to operate under popular services like Amazon.com, under unfavorable conditions.\n\nTo address this situation, Rutgers researcher, Dr. Naftaly Minsky, have developed a mechanism that enables practically any Internet service to make a useful range of promises regarding its services, which can be justifiably trusted by practically any Internet client\u2014even if these clients have no knowledge of, or trust in, the service itself.

PS-binding domain of Gas6 was used to generate Gas6-IFN-\u03b2-IFN-\u03bb fusion protein. The protein has been demonstrated to possess potent anti-tumor activities in breast cancer and melanoma in vivo models and antiviral activities in a mouse model of respiratory influenza A virus infection. Market Applications: Cancer Therapeutics, Broad-spectrum Multifunctional Antiviral Therapeutics, Research Tools. Advantages: The PS-binding domain allows targeted site-specific IFN delivery, Multifunctional mechanism of action, Higher efficacy due to synergistic effects of PS blockage and actions of IFNs, Tuning the strength of IFN activities to PS concentration, Ability to target multiple cell types that respond to either type I or type III IFNs, Piggyback delivery by enveloped viruses to target cells, Combination of the fast action of type I IFNs with long lasting effects of type III IFNs, Simplified production and delivery as a single molecule.",

    "ip_description": "Wearable systems have been emerging for broad applications. One of the major technical challenges for the technology is its power management. The self-powered wearable electronics which aim to provide users continuous, non-interrupted, and hassle-free experiences are highly desired. However, current self-powered technology faces 3 challenges: (1) unstable due to the environment variations; (2) requirement of an external bulky power management component, and (3) built on the rigid substrate.\n\nTo address these issues, a research team led by Professor Yicheng Lu at Rutgers University has developed flexible high voltage thin film transistors (f-HVTFT). This novel f-HVTFT is designed with a unique structure to achieve uniform field distribution with better mechanical strength and electrical characteristics against bending along any directions, which is particularly important for wearable systems. The f-HVTFT is fabricated at low temperature. The high blocking voltage (~150V) and sufficient on-current (~10 micro-A) satisfy the output characteristics of different energy sources, such as wearable triboelectric nanogenerators (WTNG) of high impedance and wearable solar cells. The small off-current (~ 0.01 pA) promises the low standby power, which is desired in wearable system applications. The f-HVTFT opens the possibility of a lightweight, integrated and wearable power management system.\n\nBy integrating power management system with multiple wearable energy sources, a more stable power can be provided for wearable electronics without external connections. It enables stable and sustainable operation of wearable and portable systems.\n\nMarket Applications:\nSelf-powered wearable systems built on flexible substrates, including plastics and fabrics\nFlexible power management systems with small size, lightweight, and stable and sustainable operation\nFlexible HVTFTs for inverter and converter circuits used in MEMS and flexible displays\nAdvantages:\nHigh voltage operation, key for power management\nFlexible \u2013 suitable for wearable systems\nLow temperature processing (<400oC)\nMore reliable and stable than organic HVTFT\nMechanical strength and uniform electrical characteristics against bending along random directions\nLow cost",

Most computational models rely on large numbers of weak interactions to describe protein energetics. One challenge of folding a protein through computer modeling and simulations using quantum mechanics lies in finding the global minimum of the protein conformational energy landscape which corresponds to a region close to the global energy minimum. There is therefore a need for improved and/or complementary analysis tools for understanding, predicting, and designing protein and/or peptide behavior, intra- and inter- protein interactions, and the three-dimensional structure of proteins based on the primary amino acid sequence. Rutgers researcher Dr. Lawrence Williams has developed a computer-implemented method and system for modeling the three-dimensional structure of a protein by generating an energy map for peptides and/or proteins given the amino acid sequence and a per-residue conformation index. The description of proteins in terms of per-residue interaction potentials allows proteins to be understood both qualitatively and quantitatively. CHARMM, a top performing force-field simulation software package, and Watermap, the most widely accepted best-performing solvation computational tool, both require long computing times (hours or days), while the novel proposed method performs in much shorter periods (seconds). Applications A computational tool which can be utilized for designing drugs, protein mutation studies, 3D protein folding, and protein engineering.

The most efficient vectors and their corresponding toxicities are highlighted with red arrows.\n\nFor various biomedical research and preclinical or clinical applications, stem cells (SCs) are transfected ex-vivo with transgenes to either express a biomolecule or differentiate in a certain way. This genetic engineering process usually involves the use of a gene delivery system (vector) to transfect the SCs. Many research laboratories prefer to use non-viral vectors to genetically modify SCs because they are more cost-effective and, in general, safer than viral vectors. However, commercially available non-viral vectors (polymers and lipids) not only have low transfection efficiency (at best 30%), but also could negatively impact SC viability and/or cause genotoxicity. Electroporation is another method for SC transfection, but it leads to excessive cell death (>60% toxicity). Therefore, there is a need for the development of a vector that is both efficient and safe.\n\nRutgers Scientists have developed a gene transfer system that include a novel recombinant non-viral fusion peptide vector and a transfection cocktail that have been optimized to achieve high transfection efficiency without significant somatic- or genotoxicity. Side-by-side comparison with five commercially available transfection reagents that are advertised for SC transfection demonstrated that our system leads to more than 50% efficiency, while the commercially available reagents only had 30% or less efficiency.\n\nFurther, the scientists investigated cell proliferation rates, membrane integrity and morphology, genotoxicity, gene regulation (microarray analysis), SC surface biomarkers and SC differentiation.

Therapeutic treatments are often ineffective because they lack cell-type specificity, even when combined with psychological intervention. Off-target effects of traditional treatments mostly are not easy for patients to tolerate. Therefore, improved and effective therapeutic treatments are highly desired. Rutgers scientists created a gene therapy-based method for treating depression, by utilizing the retina as a target for DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs) expression. This method circumvents neurosurgical problems associated with brain-injected DREADDs for human therapeutics. Our solution involves a simple outpatient clinical procedure (one intravitreal injection) to first express the DREADD in the patient, followed by either eye drops or pills to activate the receptors. This method works on the same neurological pathways that provides elevated mood in response to bright light. Data generated to date indicate that depression-like behavior in rats (weight loss, immobility as measured by forced swim test) can be prevented by use of our invention (DD-hM3Dq) compared to control (shown in Figure 1).

The disorder affects about 1% of the population. Early detection and treatment significantly improves patient response to treatment; and can prevent progression to full relapse by prompting adequate clinical intervention. In addition, currently schizophrenia diagnosis requires a diagnostic battery such as the SCID-II personality assessment which can take up to an hour and must be administered by a mental health professional, psychologist, or psychiatrist. Researchers at Rutgers have developed a diagnostic software system that can be hosted on a variety of computer platforms (e.g., mobile device) that allows clinicians to use displayed dynamic 3-D computer graphics to assess disease severity in schizophrenia patients.

    "published_date": "3/6/2018",
    "ip_description": "Various pathological states including tissue injuries, inflammation, degenerative diseases and cancer are frequently associated with elevated free radicals, such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. These locally-generated free radicals are extremely reactive and are known to damage cells and tissues to exacerbate the pathology. Rutgers scientists have developed a novel strategy that aims to harness the reactivity of these free radicals to target and sustain the delivery of therapeutics.\n\nThe therapeutic is conjugated to a biomaterial that reacts with free radicals to crosslink. Elevated levels of free radicals at the site of injury or disease lead to crosslinking locally, thereby immobilizing the conjugated therapeutics at the site of injury. In addition, the crosslinking process itself also consumes free radicals, which can reduce radical-mediated damage.\n\nOne example application is traumatic brain injury (TBI). Following TBI, free radicals are produced by a number of mechanisms and contribute to the propagation of damage long after the initial trauma. This novel approach described above has the potential to enhance neuronal survival and recovery following TBI by protecting cells and tissue from free radicals while simultaneously targeting and sustaining the delivery of trophic, regenerative and neuroprotective factors.\n\nSimilarly, biomaterials conjugated with image-enhancing agents can be used for early detection of diseases that are associated with increased free radical generation. For example, pro-inflammatory cells that infiltrate the tumor microenvironment produce high levels of free radicals. This approach can potentially facilitate the detection of early stage tumors without the need for ligand-specific markers.\n\nMarket Applications:\n\nTargeted delivery of bioactive materials such as therapeutics, trophic factors and micronutrients\nFree radical scavenger \u2013 prevention of secondary injury\nApplicable to a variety of diseases associated with elevated level of free radicals\nImaging/detection of early stage diseases\nAdvantages:\n\nLow cost\nTargeted delivery of treatment\nAdaptable to various injuries or diseases\nBiocompatible & biodegradable",

    "ip_description": "Neuropathic pain (NP) typically arises as a consequence of a lesion or disease affecting peripheral nerve fibers. Prominent features in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain include increased, ectopic neuronal activity in pain pathways. In general, NP is frequently refractory to conventional analgesics and currently there are no effective treatments.\n\nRutgers researchers have proposed a chemogenetic therapy for NP, where a novel viral vector encoding the synthetic Gi-coupled DREADD (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) receptor known as hM4Di, is microinjected into the trigeminal ganglion of rat. A robust expression of the hM4Di receptor in ganglion neurons is achieved under control of the Tac1 promoter. After the hM4Di receptor is activated by the DREADD agonist, e.g. Olanzapine (marketed as Zyprexia), the indices of pain in the rat model of trigeminal neuralgia are significantly decreased.\nIn addition, the hM4Di receptors are transported distally along trigeminal ganglion axons, therefore, these receptors can be stimulated peripherally to achieve pain relief, e.g., by topical application of a skin cream containing the DREADD agonist. This targeted gene therapy should also be effective for other neuralgias by expressing the hM4Di receptor in the dorsal root ganglion associated with any peripheral nerve.\nAdvantages:\n\nNovel targeted gene therapy to express the hM4Di receptor in peripheral ganglion neurons and decrease their activity by administration of the DREADD agonist\nTac1 promoter-driven vector to express hM4Di receptors specially in neurokinin neurons to limit effect of the DREADD agonist to neurons that mediate pain information\nA topical application of the DREADD agonist in a skin cream\nMarket Applications:\n\nA therapy to treat any painful peripheral never neuralgia, including trigeminal neuralgia",

    "ip_description": "Various materials have been tried for fabricating high voltage thin film transistors (HVTFTs), including amorphous-Si, poly-Si, and organic materials. However, these TFTs all have certain limitations, ranging from low blocking voltage, low ON-current, high cost, high process temperature, poor uniformity and stability, to complex fabrication process. These issues prevent the existing technologies being used as HVTFT on glass for solar inverters. A research team led by Professor Yicheng Lu at Rutgers University has developed a novel Mg-doped zinc oxide (MZO)-based HVTFT on glass technology. MZO possesses a wide energy bandgap and a good thermal conductivity, which are critical for high voltage devices. In comparison with the pure zinc oxide TFT, MZO HVTFT shows better and uniform electrical performance and stability. The unique ring structure configuration of the MZO HVTFT on glass has superior electrical field distributions as compared to the conventional rectangular configuration, enabling mitigation of electrical field crowding and therefore leading to much enhanced blocking voltage capability. Further, the novel interface design and engineering prevent zinc diffusion from the channel to gate dielectric, therefore enhancing the electrical performance and increasing the blocking voltage. Through these innovations, MZO HVTFT on glass provides a very high blocking voltage (>600 V) and a large ON/OFF current ratio (>109). The manufacturing process is fully compatible with the fabrication of conventional TFTs on glass. Market Applications: Micro-Inverters in integrated photovoltaics system on glass (PV-SOG) for Building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), self-powered smart glasses, high speed printers, digital radiology instruments.

There are two classes of FMs, the ash FM (organo-molybdenum molecules) and ashless FM (sulfur-free organic molecules). The ashless modifiers such as fatty acid esters have the added advantage of being more environmentally friendly. However, current fatty acid molecules degrade too quickly and result in reduced efficacy over time. Rutgers researchers have incorporated fatty acids into thermocleavable systems to produce di-tert-butylT18 which exhibits: (1) step-wise thermal degradation into friction modifying intermediates, (2) controlled release degradation at 200\u02daC or higher (the relevant temperature in car engine pistons), and (3) solubility in base oil.
