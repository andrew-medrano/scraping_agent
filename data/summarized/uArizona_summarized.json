This rack ensures consistent growth conditions for cells compared to traditional incubator practices where plates are often directly stacked, potentially affecting the growth consistency of cultured cells. In laboratory settings, cell cultures are commonly grown in microplates that are placed directly in incubators. Reducing plate-to-plate variation when performing cell culture in microplates is an essential goal in cell-based research. Existing incubator racks have solid (often thermally conductive metal) shelves and walls. This limits air flow around the microplates (causing differences in CO2/O2 exposure and evaporation among plates in the stack), as well as increases thermal conductivity often causing the plates closer to the bottom stack to change temperature faster, which can lead to inconsistent growth that can affect experimental outcomes. Hence, there is a need for incubator racks that can better support consistent growth of cell cultures across multiple microplates. Applications include cell culture, laboratory research, biotechnology, pharmaceutical industries, educational institutions, and clinical research.

AGS is triggered by the ingestion of alpha-galactose (aGal), a carbohydrate found in red meat and, in some cases, dairy products. While not all AGS patients react to dairy, avoiding its consumption completely is often recommended to prevent symptom progression. This method preprocesses milk using an enzyme to remove aGal effectively, resulting in a product suitable for AGS patients without sacrificing the nutritional benefits of milk. This innovative approach not only reduces the immunoreactivity of aGal in milk but also ensures the process is cost-effective, leveraging an enzyme already available as a supplement. This method provides a potential breakthrough for AGS patients, expanding safe dietary options and contributing to improved quality of life. This technology addresses the challenge faced by individuals with Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS), a condition triggered by consuming alpha-galactose (aGal) which is found in red meat and dairy products. AGS can cause severe allergic reactions, leading to recommendations that all AGS patients avoid dairy, despite only 10-20% being affected by it. Currently, the only effective strategy for these individuals is complete dietary avoidance of foods containing aGal, limiting their access to essential nutrients found in dairy products. This restriction impacts quality of life and nutritional intake, as there are no widely available dairy alternatives that ensure alpha-gal is eliminated.

TR is a phenomenon that occurs when the temperature in a LIB causes reactions to occur which produce more heat, which causes more reactions and is one of the leading causes of LIB fires. This technology uses an array of thermal sensors placed throughout a LIB module to collect real-time data. Then, a convolutional neural network-based machine learning model is used to compare the data to electrochemical models and predict whether TR will occur. By enabling the early detection of potential TR events, this technology identifies heat source locations and triggers real-time alerts, enhancing battery safety and thermal management. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) power a wide range of technologies including electric vehicles, phones, laptops, and wearable electronics. They are widely used because of their efficiency, high energy density, long lifespan, and fast charging, among other factors.

By combining biological treatment with membrane distillation, this technology guarantees high-quality water reuse while significantly cutting energy use. Unlike conventional systems that rely on membrane bioreactors followed by reverse osmosis (MBR-RO), which require large amounts of electrical energy and create brine waste, this MBR-MD system eliminates brine waste and runs on much lower energy levels.

The manifold integrates pressure relief mechanisms before and after a ball valve, ensuring that hazardous energy from pneumatic, hydraulic, or water-powered tools is safely controlled. The isolation of energy ensures that tools and supply lines are not over-pressurized when operating or during an ascent from depth. This system enhances diver safety by enabling in-water control of hazardous energy and rapid intervention during emergencies or tool maintenance.

The system leverages the light field synthesizer to convert a single probe pulse into a train of temporally separated pulses, each with a distinct wavelength range. These pulses interact with a sample at different time delays, capturing multiple snapshots of the event's progression in a single measurement with high precision. These time delays can be adjusted by the user to optimally capture different types of events. This imaging technique makes it possible to take many shots of a sequence of events with only one measurement. This makes it ideal for the study of fast, non-repetitive phenomena in fields like material science, biophotonics, and chemical reactions. Traditional pump-probe imaging techniques often require a sequence of events to be repeated multiple times.

It functions by utilizing ultrashort pulses, shorter than ten femtoseconds, to modulate the reflectivity of a material at optical frequencies greater than 100 THz. The modulation rate can be tuned for different purposes, as both the pulse repetition rates and interpulse delay times are adjustable. This modulation creates an environment in which entangled proton pairs can be generated via the dynamic Casimir effect. Furthermore, the high temporal resolution and high repetition rate of this laser pulse method allows it to be applied to a broad range of time-varying photonic applications. Developing time-varying photonics at optical wavelengths is a significant research challenge. To achieve time-varying photonics in the visible range, modulation of the optical properties of a material must be achieved at extremely high frequencies.

The ability to control the transmission of light through different sections of the glass structure paves the way for diverse applications in optics and other fields requiring tailored optical properties. Glass is an essential material, because of its physical and chemical properties. However, it is a material that is challenging to process in terms of transparency, strength, and resistance to chemical reactions. Tuning glass transparency is a key element of controlling light intensity and blocking unwanted light when creating microstructures. Current 3D printing methods of glass have limited control over transparency, in which other processes must be used to improve and create the transparency. An improved method would allow for enhanced structure functionality and more applications. Additive manufacturing techniques, such as two-photon polymerization, have opened new possibilities for creating intricate 3D microstructures. This invention addresses these challenges by allowing precise in-situ control over the transparency of glass micro-objects during the printing process, offering enhanced design flexibility and efficiency.",

    "ip_description": "Chronic pain affects millions of people, making it a challenging condition to effectively manage. Traditional methods of assessing and treating pain rely heavily on subjective measures, which can lack accuracy and sensitivity. As a result, there is a growing need for objective tools to assess chronic pain and improve treatment outcomes. EEG (electroencephalography) has emerged as a promising option, offering a noninvasive, portable way to measure brain activity and capture real time changes related to pain perception. EEG's high temporal resolution allows for tracking rapid changes in brain processes, making it an ideal tool for studying pain modulation in clinical and research settings. The goal of this innovation is to use EEG data, which captures real time brain activity, and machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict which patients are most likely to respond to spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy, a common treatment for chronic pain. By identifying key EEG features linked to pain response, the system aims to provide a more reliable and objective way of predicting treatment success. While this innovation is still in development, it holds the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes by helping doctors tailor treatments based on individual neural profiles, reducing the risk of unsuccessful surgeries and improving cost effectiveness in pain management. Chronic pain is notoriously difficult to manage because it is largely subjective, and current assessment methods rely heavily on patient reported outcomes, which can be inconsistent and imprecise. Existing solutions, like questionnaires and pain scales, fail to capture the complexity of chronic pain and often lead to trial and error treatment approaches, including invasive procedures like spinal cord stimulation (SCS) without a clear prediction of success. This results in some patients undergoing unnecessary surgeries or treatments that do not alleviate their pain, adding both physical and financial burdens. This innovation aims to address the need for an objective, reliable tool to assess and predict treatment outcomes for chronic pain patients. Unlike traditional methods, this approach provides a data driven, personalized way to predict which patients will benefit from the therapy, potentially reducing unsuccessful interventions and improving patient outcomes. It represents a significant improvement over current technologies by offering objective insights into chronic pain and the likelihood of treatment success.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a twisting heliostat that automatically adjusts its reflector\u2019s shape throughout the day to adapt to changes in the sun\u2019s relative position to the heliostat field. It uses closed loop tracking to ensure that that light reflected from each twisted heliostat is centered on a target point. This design allows for higher concentration of solar energy with better efficiency than conventional heliostats with a fixed shape. Researchers developed and tested a prototype to validate the twisting heliostat design.\n\nHeliostats are reflectors placed on rotating mounts capable of reflecting incoming sunlight to a target. Fields of heliostats are used to reflect sunlight towards a central point, concentrating the solar power reaching the field at that single spot as a method of solar energy generation. For each heliostat in a heliostat field to achieve the highest possible concentration, its reflector must be in a toroid shape. The ideal side lengths of this toroid vary depending on the angle of incident sunlight.\n\nStandard heliostats are capable of dual-axis rotation to continuously reflect the sun\u2019s rays to a target point but have fixed reflector shapes that cannot be changed to reflect changes in the angle of incident sunlight throughout the day. Additionally, many current heliostats operate on open loop tracking systems in which the ideal heliostat angle is calculated based on the heliostat\u2019s location on Earth and the relative positions of the Earth and Sun. While functional, these systems can\u2019t achieve a high level of precision since they can\u2019t account for uneven ground conditions or heliostat flaws and irregularities.

It enhances traditional identity verification methods by using occupation-specific questions. For instance, a doctor might be asked about medical terminology, while an accountant could face questions about financial regulations. By leveraging recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) and large language models like ChatGPT, it dynamically generates unique challenge questions tailored to the user's professional knowledge and experience, ensuring only those with genuine expertise can successfully authenticate. Occu-KBA also incorporates behavioral analytics, evaluating not just the correctness of answers but also how users interact with their devices while answering. This multi-factor approach enhances security, making it significantly harder to breach. The tool can seamlessly integrate with existing systems, providing a more personalized and secure user experience across various industries such as finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and government services. This solution effectively addresses the common challenges of traditional methods, such as forgotten answers and compromised databases, and offers robust protection against family-and-friends fraud. Traditional Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) methods that rely on static or dynamic challenge questions often suffer from issues such as users forgetting their answers, cumbersome processes, and the availability of compromised KBA answer databases on the dark web.

This method adds an extra layer of precision by allowing the decoder to handle variable nodes with higher precision, enabling the correction of previously challenging error patterns more effectively than traditional bit-flipping methods.\n\nQuantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes have recently gained attention over topological codes due to their superior minimum distance and asymptotically scaling code rates. However, QLDPC codes impose long-range qubit connections that increase noise and add delays, restricting the latency available for decoding. Traditional decoders like belief propagation (BP) and min-sum (MS) struggle with handling trapping sets in QLDPC codes, leading to poor error correction performance, particularly in error-floor regions. The proposed method, adapted from classical error-correction techniques, addresses these issues by allowing greater flexibility in flipping decisions based on node states, making it a low-latency, high-performance solution for quantum applications. This framework allows multiple decoders to operate collectively, which enhances the error-correcting capabilities of QLDPC codes while maintaining computational efficiency.",

    "ip_description": "This invention encompasses a series of DNA-based antimicrobial compounds that prevent transmission of _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ (Ngo) during sexual intercourse and possibly treat an extant Ngo infection, alone or in combination with antibiotics, while leaving commensals unharmed. These DNA molecules are effective against low-passage antibiotic sensitive and resistant Ngo clinical isolates through a unique and experimentally proven mode of action. These \u201ckiller\u201d DNA molecules have the following attributes: They have defined nucleotide sequences with homology to genes essential for Ngo viability, linked to a DNA Uptake Sequence (DUS) that allows them to enter Ngo cells; and they are methylated differently than Ngo DNA. Upon entering Ngo, the \u201ckiller\u201d DNAs attempt to recombine with homologous sequences in the chromosome; restriction/methylation systems in the cell recognize the DNA heteroduplexes as foreign because of their mismatched methylation signatures and nick these complexes, leading to chromosome instability and ultimately cell death. These DNA molecules kill over 90% of input Ngo cells in both buffered media and commercially available personal lubricants. These first-in-class microbicides are designed to be incorporated into personal lubricants that can be applied topically by the user prior to sexual intercourse, or into lubricants on condoms. Gonorrhea is the second most reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI). Each year, _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ (Ngo) causes over 1.5 million new infections in the United States, and >87 million worldwide. The decades-long effort to develop a gonorrhea vaccine has been unsuccessful, and the ability of Ngo to rapidly develop antibiotic resistance greatly limits the effectiveness of antibiotics currently approved for treating gonorrhea. The effectiveness of the few antibiotics in the development pipeline will be short-lived: Ngo has already developed resistance to Zoliflodacin, an antibiotic in Phase 3 clinical trials. Prevention and treatment of gonorrhea remain elusive goals. This invention addresses these needs. These DNA-based antimicrobial compounds, introduced topically in gel form to the genital surfaces during sexual intercourse, kill Ngo thereby preventing transmission. They do not harm commensals.

The invention consists of algorithms that aim to accurately classify objects with varying softness and roughness into corresponding deformation or texture labels. By designing and implementing a sensor-based system which comprises feature extraction and a recognition module, the surgeon can detect texture (the roughness of a biological organ on its surface) and deformation (tissue hardness / softness). It integrates two microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors and a force-sensitive resistor (FSR) sensor attached to a thoracic grasper instrument.

    "ip_description": "This invention is an apparatus and method for controlling the motion of heliostats, which are mirrors that reflect sunlight towards a common target. For heliostats to be maximally efficient, they must be able to shift in orientation precisely as the Sun\u2019s relative position to the Earth changes. This technology utilizes a beamsplitter perpendicular to a heliostat reflector surface and to the incident and reflected rays of sunlight, as well as a camera that views both the sunlight transmitted through the beamsplitter and the sunlight reflected from the beamsplitter. By applying the law of reflection, the system ensures that the images of the sun and the target captured by the camera share a common center when the heliostat is correctly oriented. A computer processes these images to continuously adjust the heliostat\u2019s orientation, maintaining accurate targeting of the reflected sunlight. The integrated dual-axis mount and automatic mechanical shape adjustment significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of solar energy collection. Numerous heliostat tracking and orientation correction methods currently exist, including open loop methods, which calculate the necessary orientations of each heliostat in a tower or field based on relative positions of the Earth and Sun and the precise location of the heliostat. However, these methods are imprecise and cannot account for irregularities or imperfections in the heliostat, or for uneven or rocky ground beneath a heliostat tower or field. Closed loop methods of heliostat control, in which the heliostat\u2019s degree of unalignment is continuously calculated using sensors and cameras and then corrected, are more effective and precise than open loop methods, but many current methods require cameras with very wide fields of view, which have relatively low resolution and high distortion. This limits the accuracy of most current closed loop heliostat orientation control to greater than 1 milliradian milliseconds.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a novel method for measuring pressure inside the body without invasive procedures that combines ultrasound and laser technologies through the acousto-optic effect. By combining ultrasound and laser technologies, it offers a safe and accurate way to assess pressure levels in biological environments. An ultrasound wave is directed at the target area, such as the eye or brain tissue, which creates variable vibrations in the tissue depending on the internal pressure. At the same time, a laser beam is aimed at the vibrating tissue. When the ultrasound wave and laser light interact, they produce changes in the diffraction pattern of the laser light. These changes are linked to variations in the speed of sound, which correspond to changes in pressure. By analyzing the angle and intensity of the diffracted laser light, precise measurements of pressure at different depths and locations within the tissue can be obtained. This method is advantageous as it is non-invasive, eliminating the need for uncomfortable procedures such as measuring intraocular or intracranial pressure. With its potential applications in ophthalmology, neurology, and cardiology, this technology could significantly enhance patient care and medical diagnostics.

    "ip_description": "This technology is a functional test to assess which patients will have toxicity to drugs that use the same transporters as ezetimibe glucuronide, or EZE-Gluc. By administering ezetimibe, a commonly used drug, as a predictive diagnostic tool, healthcare providers can gauge the likelihood of treatment success for various medications. The key lies in measuring the levels of a specific metabolite, EZE-Gluc, in either urine or blood samples. This metabolite's behavior shifts in patients with Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH), affecting its elimination process. Normally eliminated through bile, in MASH patients, it tends to accumulate in plasma and urine instead. Understanding how EZE-Gluc behaves in MASH patients provides valuable insights into the functioning of crucial transport processes in the body. These processes not only impact the efficacy of ezetimibe but also influence the disposition of other drugs that share the same transport mechanisms. By conducting tests to assess EZE-Gluc levels before initiating treatment with drugs like pemetrexed, methotrexate, sorafenib, and others, healthcare providers can identify patients who might be at risk of adverse reactions or altered therapeutic outcomes. The technology addresses the challenge of predicting the effectiveness and potential adverse reactions of various drugs, particularly in patients with conditions like Metabolic dysfunction-Associated SteatoHepatitis (MASH). Currently, healthcare providers rely on trial and error or general guidelines to determine the most suitable treatment for individual patients. However, this approach can lead to inefficiencies, suboptimal outcomes, and even harmful side effects. Existing methods for assessing drug efficacy and toxicity typically involve monitoring symptoms, conducting laboratory tests, or adjusting dosages based on observed reactions. By using ezetimibe as a predictive diagnostic tool and measuring the levels of its metabolite, EZE-Gluc, healthcare providers gain valuable insights into the patient's ability to transport and eliminate certain drugs. This information allows for more targeted treatment plans, potentially reducing the risk of adverse reactions and improving therapeutic outcomes.

Green's functions can be obtained from cross correlation techniques when either the location of an acoustic source is known or when it is unknown. The geometric phase as a function of frequency is a sensitive indicator of the structure of surface and subsurface features in the geological environment. The sensitivity of geometric phase sensing provides unique advantages in the detection of features (e.g., oil and gas deposits, geological structures) compared to current active or passive source techniques that depend only on the amplitude of reflected and transmitted waves. Traditional seismic sensing methods predominantly use the amplitude of seismic waves to infer the presence and characteristics of subsurface features. However, these methods can be limited in their resolution and sensitivity, particularly in complex geological environments. The geometric phase of seismic waves, which changes with frequency, offers a more detailed picture of geological structures. This invention opens new opportunities for the detection of surface and subsurface features in the geological environment which will allow for accurate and robust detection of oil and gas deposits, among other subsurface and surface resources. The information available from the geometric phase as a function of frequency will enable industrial application in sensing and discovery that are unavailable from current active source methods.",

    "published_date": "5/13/2024",
    "ip_description": "This innovation involves the development of a probe that attaches to a specific protein called cardiac troponin I (cTnI), which is involved in muscle contraction of the heart. This probe, created through genetic engineering techniques, is designed to detect changes in cTnI's neighboring protein, cardiac troponin T (cTnT). When there's a change in cTnT, it alters the environment around cTnI, which the probe can detect by changes in fluorescence. Essentially, the probe acts like a sensor that fluoresces when it detects certain changes in the heart muscle. The purpose of this innovation is to aid in the validation of potential drug candidates for treating a heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). By using this probe, researchers can observe how different drugs affect the interaction between cTnI and cTnT. This information helps in understanding the effectiveness of drugs in treating HCM, a condition characterized by thickening of the heart muscle, and may lead to the development of improved treatment options for patients with this condition. This technology is addressing the need for better methods to understand and treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is a condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, leading to potential complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure. Current solutions for studying HCM involve various methods, including genetic testing, imaging techniques like echocardiography, and medications to manage symptoms. However, these methods often fall short in providing a detailed understanding of the molecular changes underlying HCM and assessing the effectiveness of potential treatments. The innovation here lies in the development of a probe that specifically targets cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and detects changes in its neighboring protein, cardiac troponin T (cTnT), at a molecular level. This probe offers a more direct and precise method to monitor the interaction between these proteins, which is crucial in understanding the mechanisms of HCM and evaluating drug candidates. Unlike current methods, which may lack specificity or provide indirect measurements, this probe-based approach offers real-time, molecular-level insights into the dynamics of the heart muscle, potentially leading to more effective treatments for HCM. It provides a way to observe subtle changes in protein interactions that may not be easily detectable with conventional techniques, offering a promising avenue for both research and clinical applications in managing HCM.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is for the improvement of nanopore sequencing base calling accuracy via an iterative approach involving the use of existing machine learning algorithms and alignment with ground-truth references. This new method allows base calling accuracy to improve as the technology is trained, which in turn creates countless opportunities for sequencing improvement in a variety of applications. The concept of nanopore sequencing was first described in publication by Branton, Deamer et al in PNAS in 1996. The research group showed translocation of nucleic acids through a nanopore set in a lipid bilayer, and noted that \"Channel blockades can therefore be used to measure polynucleotide length. In 1998 US Patent 5,795,782, \"Characterization of Individual Polymer Molecules Based on Monomer-Interface Interactions\" was granted as one of the first nanopore sequencing technology patents. Since this discovery, the accuracy of base calling has decreased due to chemically modified nucleotides which have caused significant restriction of DNA/RNA investigation with nanopore sequencing. This novel method polishes yielded sequences, comparing them to references that allows for accuracy convergence over time. Applications include training of nanopore sequencing base calling software via machine learning. Advantages include: System is trained over time improving accuracy, Improved sequencing of DNA/RNA, Utilizes common exiting ML technology, Allows for determination of therapeutic RNA agents quality.",

These benefits are accomplished through the incorporation of three innovative components in the RC/AC system: a broadband solar reflector capable of reflecting the entire solar spectrum which makes daytime radiative cooling possible; the use of fluids and gasses with high thermal emissivity as the working fluid, making heat exchange between the system and surrounding environment as efficient as possible; and an angular shield designed to block incoming thermal radiation and reduce the impacts of water vapor on cooling efficiency, minimizing the impacts of parasitic heating and allowing for efficient operation in humid environments. The compact design of the system makes it ideal for use in commercial and residential settings. Air conditioning systems have many limitations, such as electrical issues, leaking ducts, and/or refrigerant leaks or low levels that cause the unit to underperform or not function properly, all while expending additional energy and increasing cost to users.

This system encodes data by varying the width of pits on the disc, allowing each pit to represent multiple bits of information. By exploiting the diffraction properties of light, this technology employs angular-selective thin film coatings that filter diffracted light based on its angle. With the integration of a multiplex detector array, this approach allows for the encoding of multiple bits of information and enables precise determination of pit widths and the encoded data, resulting in higher storage density compared to traditional optical storage media, which typically encode data based solely on the presence or absence of pits. Traditional optical storage media, like CDs and DVDs, encode data using binary pits and lands on their surfaces. The presence or absence of pits represents binary data (0s and 1s), which limits the amount of data that can be stored. To overcome this limitation, this invention utilizes pits of varying widths to encode multiple bits of data in each pit. Additionally, with the rise of cloud storage and high-capacity flash drives, optical storage media has seen a decline in popularity. One problem with this type of storage is limited storage capacity compared to newer technologies. Optical storage mediums have slower data transfer processing.

Strong turbulence regime poses different technical challenges with quantum communications technologies in areas such as terrestrial free-space optical links, uplink to high-altitude platform systems (HAPS), uplink/downlink to/from satellites, near-Earth applications, and underwater communications, to mention a few. Entanglement, or the strong correlation between particles, as used in quantum communication can help beat classical channel capacities, achieve better than classical sensors sensitivity, and provide quantum-mechanics based security.

BIA technology is applied to the limited area of breast as opposed to whole body measurements commonly used to assess adiposity. The goal of the breast BIA device is to reduce breast cancer health disparities by enabling a \"pre-screening\" of breast density (without radiation) that would indicate whether standard mammography screening should be undertaken. Populations particularly targeted will be those in low resource settings as well as younger (under age of 40) Hispanic and African American women who have a higher prevalence of early onset breast cancer.\n\nBIA is most commonly used for whole body assessment of excess adiposity, i.e. obesity. BIA is not currently used as a screening tool for breast cancer, though breast tissue is largely made up of fat and water. Mammography is the current clinical standard for breast cancer risk assessment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessed breast density works on the principles of fat and water and is being developed as an alternative to mammography for breast cancer risk assessment. MRI does not introduce radiation whereas mammography screening does introduce radiation. There is no radiation exposure with BIA either. In fact, BIA current is imperceptible and no side effects have been demonstrated; it is essentially non-invasive. BIA also has the advantage of being able to be small and highly portable and, therefore, amenable to field screenings which are important for rural areas and other underserved populations.",

Analysis of Ce3+-doped BASL glass samples properties confirmed the absence of both strong concentration quenching and Ce3+ oxidation. This Ce3+-doped BASL glass has multiple special applications in advanced photonics manufacturing, laser applications, as well as high energy radiation and particle detection and visualization, medical imaging, radiation-resistant components and devices, neutrino and dark matter detectors, illumination, holography, fiber-optic and magneto-optic devices. Among glass materials, only silicate glasses generally show favorable mechanical properties, chemical durability, thermal shock resistance and thermodynamic stability, making them generally more convenient to handle. However, their doping level is limited due to the facile transition from Ce3+ to Ce4+ during glass melting. Heavy metal oxide, fluoride, or chalcogenide glass materials have more favorable spectral properties, but they are very hard to handle, produce in large volumes and/or dope with high Ce3+ content while maintaining high emission efficiency. Therefore, they have limited benefits compared to crystalline materials. Trivalent cerium (Ce3+)-doped materials possess extraordinary optical and physical properties including no absorption transitions across the entire visible and near-infrared wavelength region (400-3500 nm), broadband UV and visible luminescence (250-700 nm), large Verdet constant, high resistance to radiation and photo-darkening and high scintillation yield. Although photonic devices based on highly Ce3+-doped crystals and films have seen significant progress, their fabrication processes are expensive, complex and time-consuming particularly when compared with glass, and their applications are also restricted by the drawbacks of crystals and films, such as small apertures, brittleness and anisotropy.

This invention not only recognizes the higher demand of iron that characterizes cancer cells, but also takes into account other physiological differences between malignant cells and the surrounding tissue. Specifically, pro-drugs are designed to activate into iron chelating agents within the reducing environment of the cytoplasm of cancer cells. The pro-chelators may be used to target malignant cells or in the treatment in a condition associated with metal ion dysregulation. The pro-chelators may be conjugated to a carbohydrate moiety, which may increase their selectivity for cells that overexpress glucose transporters, for example malignant cells.\n\nBasic and clinical research has improved significantly the prognosis and number of treatment options for cancer patients in the past decades. Broad-spectrum cytotoxins and their unwanted side effects, however, continue to be part of cancer chemotherapy in the clinical practice. Current research efforts are responding to the pressing need for more targeted, less toxic treatment options. Such approaches are necessarily based on new or previously overlooked information on the genetic and/or metabolic makeup of cancer cells, particularly on peculiarities that differentiate them from normal cells within the same tissue. We pursue the molecular design of strategies to study and exploit an aspect of cancer metabolism that is not targeted by current clinical chemotherapy, namely the altered iron metabolism of malignant cells.\n\nIn order to sustain their rapid proliferation rates, cancer cells require higher iron content when compared to normal cells. As such, the use of small-molecule scavengers (chelators) of iron ions could deprive cancer cells of this essential supply, thereby slowing or halting cancer growth. Indeed, chelation therapy has been employed clinically for decades in cases of iron overload conditions associated with genetic disorders, such as thalassemia and hemochromatosis. The key to the success of chelation therapy in cancer treatment, however, is the ability to target iron ions in malignant cells without affecting iron levels in the bloodstream and in normal tissue. Lacking such selectivity, currently available chelators were found to elicit adverse side effects when employed in the context of cancer research.\n\nApplications:\n*   Intracellular iron chelation, targeted at cancer therapy\n*   Treatment of metal ion dysregulation, including iron overload\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Reduce proliferation of malignant cells\n*   Improve selectivity for iron chelation within malignant cells\n*   Targeted treatment for iron overload",

    "ip_description": "This invention involves swept back wings that use Leading-Edge Vortex (LEV) for more controlled improvements of fixed wing aircraft. The technology enables a greater lift force and better aeronautical stability. Additional testing has shown that introducing a crank or a protuberance in the leading edge can initiate the process of vortex liftoff at lower incidence angles, expanding the operational range of the wing before stall conditions are met. Moreover, the use of a high-speed, small jet has demonstrated the potential to delay the vortex liftoff and alter its trajectory, thereby mitigating buffet and enhancing pitch and yaw control. Research conducted on tailless airplane models with swept-back wings has revealed that a Leading-Edge Vortex (LEV) formed on these wings has a significant impact on their pressure distribution, consequently influencing the various forces and moments acting on the wing, such as lift, drag, pitch, yaw, and roll. When the wing is at a low angle of attack, the LEV remains concentrated around the Leading Edge (LE) area. However, as the angle of attack increases, the LEV detaches from the LE, changes its orientation, and periodically moves outward, causing substantial pressure fluctuations that can lead to flutter. Time-resolved smoke images and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) have provided new insights into the periodicity of the vortex liftoff, a phenomenon not previously observed and often assumed to be steady in computational simulations. This research has highlighted the dynamic nature of the LEV and its critical role in the aerodynamic performance of swept-back wings.",

    "ip_description": "This technology uses a multiplexing approach to online size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with Orbitrap CD-MS. A microcontroller is used to deliver pulsed injections from a large sample loop onto a SEC for online CD-MS analysis. The method produces a series of peaks spaced according to the pseudo-random injection sequence, which are demultiplexed with a Hadamard transform algorithm. This improves CD-MS signals while preserving the retention time information. This multiplexing approach provides a general solution to the inherent incompatibilities of online separations and CD-MS detection that will enable a range of applications.\n\nCharge detection mass spectrometry (CD-MS) is a powerful technique for the analysis of large, heterogeneous biomolecules. By directly measuring the charge states of individual ions, CD-MS can produce accurate mass measurements from spectra where conventional deconvolution approaches fail due to the lack of isotopic resolution or distinguishable charge states. CD-MS has found applications in the characterization of very large (up to tens of mega-Daltons (MDa)) biomolecules such as protein complexes, intact virus capsids, vaccines, and gene therapies. Growing needs in biotechnology and the introduction of commercial instruments has led to increased interest in analyzing large, heterogeneous biomolecules. CD-MS is limited in that only a small number of ions can be measured at a time, which necessitates the acquisition of many hundreds or thousands of spectra to provide enough detection events for accurate mass measurements with acceptable signal to noise ratios. These long acquisitions generally prevent the coupling of CD-MS with online (i.e., real-time) separation techniques, such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC), which typically only provide enough time for 50-200 scans during the elution of a chromatographic peak. Progress has been made on this front by refining CD-MS instrumentation to enable the measurement of multiple ions simultaneously and improve charge state assignments with deconvolution algorithms. However, a recent effort to evaluate the feasibility of online SEC-CD-MS produced deconvolved mass spectra that, while sufficient to measure accurate protein masses, had lower signal-to-noise ratios and contained significantly more erroneous peaks than spectra produced from infusion experiments. Accordingly, there remains a need to develop methods, and apparatuses containing a device, for improved acquisition of analytical data for very large, heterogeneous biomolecules and/or microorganisms.\n\nApplications:\n*   Biomolecule design and characterization\n*   Bio-based product development for therapeutics or diagnostics\n*   QC, forensics\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Improved signal-to-noise while preserving retention time information\n*   Improvement to CD-MS methods",

This innovation allows for more precise flooding of fields and precise fertilizer applications. The solution devised by the team at Yuma County Cooperative Extension promises to significantly improve the efficiency of flood irrigation for secondary crops, leading to more sustainable and productive agricultural practices in Arizona and beyond. Historically, secondary crops have relied on \u201cbasin flood irrigation,\u201d a low-cost method that flattens the land and opens a single canal gate to flood the field gradually. This is crucial not only for providing the necessary water and nutrients to the crops but also for dissolving and washing away accumulated salt.

This leads to suboptimal crop growth, as well as salt accumulation in some areas, which can be detrimental to crop health. By replacing low-output sprinkler heads, this innovation enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of flood irrigation, promoting healthier crop growth and reducing the environmental impact associated with excessive water and fertilizer use. Applications include agricultural irrigation, pre-irrigation, and salt leaching.

    "ip_description": "The invention is a dampened flexure mount capable of enhancing the vibration isolation of highly sensitive equipment, including optics, aerospace, and space applications. The mount\u2019s improved dampening capability arises from the incorporation of two or more materials in its design, where one imparts rigidity, while the other imparts flex dampening properties. The design adopts the concept of constrained layer damping. Here, a viscoelastic material is sandwiched between the mount and a rigid constraining layer. Vibrational energy, instead of adversely impacting the equipment, causes shearing in the viscoelastic layer. Over time, this vibrational energy transforms into heat in the viscoelastic layer, ensuring the vibrations do not disturb the equipment\u2019s operation. The design has a Z flexure as well as X and Y, so it is quasi-kinematic in all axes. Flexural mounts are commonly employed, particularly in optics, to create quasi-kinematic supports for components. In most optical applications, the environmental conditions are often benign. However, in scenarios where applications must endure harsh vibrations, such as during a space launch, it is often desirable to attenuate this excitation originating from the base of the structure to protect the delicate optics, detectors, and other supported components. The challenge lies in achieving the right balance between rigid support and damping capabilities. Over the years, many efforts have been made to address this concern, but finding an optimal solution that can cater to both the precision required by optical components and the durability needed to withstand intense vibrations remains a challenge.

The redox potential of various analogues within this class of compounds can be tuned for targeting of cancer cells. Following cellular uptake, the tetrazolium compounds of the present invention undergo reduction to produce formazan species that are capable of intracellular binding of various metals. In this approach, the initial prochelator compound forms an active metal-binding chelator under specific conditions in order to minimize indiscriminate depletion of essential metal ions and potential side effects. The tetrazolium prochelators are stable in blood serum and present antiproliferative activities at micromolar concentrations, as confirmed against a panel of various cancer cell lines. Multiple cell-based assays demonstrate that the compounds impact intracellular iron signaling and that the toxicity is associated, at least in part, to iron sequestration. Iron is an essential element and is the most abundant transition metal in humans. The normal functions of human cells rely on iron due to its vital role in oxygen transport, energy generation, and DNA synthesis. Altered metabolism and homeostasis of transition metal ions (such as iron, copper, and zinc) are associated with several pathological conditions including cancer and neurodegeneration. Thus, metal-binding compounds (chelators) that affect metal availability in disease conditions may be potential drug candidates. Malignant cells have a higher demand for iron to sustain their rapid proliferation rates. As a result, targeting iron metabolism in cancer cells has become a promising strategy in cancer therapy. Iron chelation therapy is a treatment that removes iron in the organism by utilizing a small-molecule scavenger.

By using activated charcoal, urease, zirconium oxide and zirconium phosphate to filter the water of contaminants, this method can make water achieve a purity level that is acceptable for clinical reuse. As dialysis becomes an essential treatment for an increasing number of patients globally, the need for water conservation in the process is paramount. By allowing water to be recycled for clinical reuse, this technology not only contributes to environmental sustainability but also ensures a steady supply of purified water for uninterrupted dialysis sessions. Dialysis is a method used to eliminate waste substances and surplus fluids from the bloodstream in situations where the kidneys are not functioning adequately.

    "ip_description": "The TWICE (Transvaginal Widefield Imaging and Confocal Endoscope) invention is a low-cost, portable confocal endomicroscope for cervical malignancy diagnosis. The device combines the capabilities of widefield imaging (similar to mobile colposcopy) and confocal microscopy images, allowing users to obtain both macroscopic and high-resolution microscopic views of the cervix using a single device. This allows for a broader and more precise examination to ensure that no abnormalities are missed, as well as high sensitivity and specificity for malignancy detection, enabling accurate diagnoses. The endomicroscope is made from high-performance, low-cost, optoelectrical components, while creating high resolution images equivalent to those of high-cost confocal microscopy devices. With this invention, early detection and diagnosis of cervical malignancy can become more widespread, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and a reduction in healthcare disparities. Timely, accurate diagnosis and treatment of cervical precancer remains a significant healthcare challenge in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). More than 80% of the 570,000 annual cervical cancer cases and 311,000 annual cervical cancer-related deaths occur in LMICs, due to the lack of resources for conducting organized screening and treatment services. In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for immediate action to end cervical cancer with a plan emphasizing the importance of screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing of self-collected samples is gaining traction as the first line screening method for cervical malignancy in LMICs. While HPV testing provides a sensitive and quantitative biomarker, a significant portion of the women with a positive HPV test will clear the HPV infection and never develop malignant diseases, which leads to overtreatment that causes an increased burden on the health care system, unnecessary adverse effects (pain, bleeding, discharge, and psychological distress), and an increased risk of adverse obstetric outcomes. Those that do develop disease also undergo additional tests that are often invasive and may not yield accurate results. Mobile colposcopes and imaging methods such as confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are now being used for medical diagnostic purposes, yet challenges remain with providing affordable devices that generate reliable results to improve patient outcomes.",

It is observed that the introduction of topological approaches might allow devices to tackle challenges related to maintaining performance in diverse environments. The potential for this innovation to influence standards of efficiency and compatibility in the acoustic device realm is worth noting. Previously, the literature has proposed to use topologically protected acoustic waves to reduce the loss of acoustic wave devices such as radio frequency devices. However, these approaches rely on topological wave supporting media which are either difficult to realize physically or lack compatibility with the manufacturing process of existing acoustic wave devices.

PAH is a severe cardiovascular disease characterized by thickening of the pulmonary arteries due to uncontrolled proliferation of smooth muscle cells, leading to right ventricular hypertrophy and failure.

    "ip_description": "This invention provides compositions and method of pain treatment using a mu/delta opioid receptor heterodimer (MDOR) antagonist which has improved druggability by nanoformulation and/or glycosylation to increase their bioavailability and efficacy. These modified antagonists and formulations provide for enhancement of opioid agonist therapy's antinociceptive effects, reduction of side effects or adverse effects of opioid agonist therapy, and reduced withdrawal symptoms. Proof-of-concept testing in animals has shown a significant increase in oxymorphone antinociception. Opioids continue to be widely used for pain treatment. However, constant opioid treatment is accompanied with serious undesirable effects including drowsiness and mental clouding, nausea and emesis, constipation and in many cases dependence and addiction. Continuous use of opioid therapy also develops analgesic tolerance and hyperalgesia in many patients. These unwanted effects significantly diminish the patients\u2019 quality of life. The mechanisms for these side effects are still largely unclear. However, one particular side effect, namely addiction, is a cause for great concern in pain treatment using opioids. Prescription opioids can be highly addictive and are widely misused. It has been estimated that the total economic cost of opioid misuse in the United States is $78.5 billion per year. The opioid crisis has been exacerbated by over-prescription of opioid pain-relievers for the treatment of pain. Due at least in part to over-prescription and additive nature of opioids, some who experience chronic pain may suffer undertreatment. In fact, in many parts of the developing world, access to opioids even for acute pain and/or cancer pain can be restricted due to concerns over addiction and overdose. Even in the United States, some patients can suffer from an undertreatment of pain. For example, patients with cognitive impairment and the elderly can be especially susceptible to the central nervous system effects of traditional opioids such as morphine and in some cases are not prescribed enough to meet their pain management needs. Receptors do not only signal as single units, but can bind to each other to form dimers and oligomers that signal differently from single receptors. In earlier work, the inventors developed a selective antagonist compound for the mu/delta opioid receptor heterodimer (MDOR), and used this ligand to show that the MDOR acted as an opioid negative feedback loop, suppressing pain relief and enhancing side effects. Reversing this effect by treatment with this approach thus has promise in improving opioid pain relief and reducing side effects like withdrawal. However, the compound studied previously is a flexible peptide with poor metabolic stability and blood-brain barrier penetration. The inventors thus sought to improve druggability by developing analogues and formulation.",

PLA is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound produced by vaginal Lactobacillus species; however, its mechanisms and functions within the cervicovaginal microenvironment are not well understood. To address the solubility issue of PLA, the researchers synthesized PLA ionic liquids (ILs) using choline and carnitine counterions, which allowed for the solubilization of D- and L-enantiomers of PLA in water. Various assays were conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the PLA ILs against different bacterial species, and it was found that antimicrobial activity varied depending on the stereochemistry of PLA and the counterion present in the ILs, but was effective overall. Overall, this study highlights the potential of PLA and its derivatives as antimicrobial agents against bacterial vaginosis. The stereochemistry of PLA and the choice of counterion in the ILs play a significant role in their antimicrobial activity, while the counterion affects the cytotoxicity to human cervical cells. Further investigations are underway to determine optimal inhibitory concentrations and explore additional formulations of PLA for potential therapeutic applications in the cervicovaginal microenvironment, which could lead to the development of more effective, targeted treatments for BV.

A \u201cphi-bit,\u201d is a two-state degree of freedom of an acoustic wave (an acoustic spin), which can be in a coherent superposition of states with complex amplitude coefficients. Phi-bits are therefore analogues of qubits. The inventors have developed a simple model of the nonlinear array of externally driven coupled acoustic waveguides to shed light on possible mechanisms for the experimentally observed behavior of the logical phi-bit phase. Lastly, the inventors illustrate the ability to experimentally initialize the state of single and multiple phi-bit systems by exploiting the drivers\u2019 phase as a tuning parameter. It is also shown that nonlinear correlation between phi-bits enables parallelism in the manipulation of two and multi phi-bit superpositions of states. Quantum computing is a growing field due to the potential for quantum computers to solve complex computations substantially faster than a regular computer. The field is also increasingly relevant as it shifts towards real world use due to applications in the pharmaceutical industry and around data security, among other uses. A major hurdle in the use of quantum computing is the expensive requirements of use. Along with physical obstacles such as the high temperature quantum computers run at, they are often not scalable due to physical limitations which do not allow for an increase of qubits. However, with the recent advancements in phi-bits, a new pathway towards scalable quantum computing has been illuminated.

Researchers plan to develop cell lines transduced with lentivirus vectors that can be cocultured and the process of trogocytosis will result in cell fusion that will generate a luminescent signal. Selected small molecules with demonstrated inhibition will undergo further studies to validate their functional properties and optimize their structure. The ultimate objective is to develop a drug that can be administered directly into the tumor site through injection or other systemic means to effectively hinder tumor development. Trogocytosis occurs when a very early-stage epithelial cell interacts with an endogenous lymphocyte in a transient manner such that membranes and protein molecules are exchanged.

Cdk5-enriched phosphoproteomics is used to uncover potential downstream mediators of rTBI and show that pharmacological inhibition of Cdk5 reduces both cognitive and pathological consequences of injuries. Millions of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) occur annually.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a smart system for the collection of cerebrospinal fluid from an external ventricular drain (EVD) that can automatically adjust the height and intercranial pressure of a patient. The invention will use a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow sensor, a way to determine the position of the patient and the collection vessel, and an actuator that can automatically adjust the position of the collection vessel to compensate for any motion of the patient to help maintain the patient\u2019s intercranial pressure. This can also determine the actual flow of CSF and adjust the height of the collection vessel so that over-drainage does not occur.\n\nExternal ventricular drain (EVD) systems are used to treat brain trauma, stroke, inflammation, and other conditions associated with the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid and blood in the brain. A typical EVD system contains a catheter inserted in the brain ventricle, tubing with a 3-way sampling port, a check valve preventing back-flow, and a collection vessel placed at a pre-determined height to ensure a constant value of intracranial pressure. One of the drawbacks of such systems is that frequent monitoring of the equipment is needed to ensure that the vessel is in a correct position.\n\nAnother issue of current EVD systems is related to the intercranial pressure. The pressure configuration of an EVD system is patient and disease specific, so it is critical to have a good value for each case. A high pressure might be less effective in treating the patient\u2019s condition, while a low pressure could result in over-draining, with a risk of collapse of ventricles and associated irreversible damage.\n\nApplications:\n*   Collection and management of cerebrospinal fluid related to\n    *   Brain trauma\n    *   Stroke\n    *   Inflammation\n    *   Other conditions associated with accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid and blood in the brain\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Can automatically change the position of the collection vessel\n*   Can determine the flow of cerebrospinal fluid\n*   Can adjust the height of the vessel so that over-drainage cannot occur\n*   Less monitoring needed from nursing staff",

The neural-field technique has a small graphic processing memory (GPU memory) footprint, which allows it to be applied in three-dimensional or higher-dimensional CT imaging. The proposed technique is self-supervised and trained instance-wisely, eliminating data labeling or any training of datasets. This algorithm can also produce synthesized projections that can be combined with existing projections to yield denser or complete projection data to be used by other image-reconstruction methods.

This seizure frequency prediction is a manifestation of the underlying pathophysiology of TLE disease states which have, heretofore, not been identified to have a dichotomized genetic basis. Targeting the underlying TLE pathophysiology in a personalized, therapeutic manner, based on leukocyte gene expression, represents a new medical decision-making paradigm, amenable to pharmacologic treatment and surgical therapy. The dichotomized approach will more appropriately target therapy to the genetic and biological pathway TLE abnormalities amenable to treatment intervention.\n\nHigh and low seizure frequency categories of intractable TLE represent two mechanistically different disease states, based on leukocyte gene expression. These newly identified leukocyte gene biomarkers, for high and low seizure frequency, may direct medical management of TLE by identifying those biological pathways and genes which are involved in the pathophysiology of individual categories of TLE, high and low seizure frequency. These newly identified leukocyte gene and biological pathway biomarkers could direct personalized medical management of intractable TLE with anti-seizure medication targeting the specific gene and biologic pathways, which are unique to high and low seizure frequency categories of disease. In addition, these newly identified leukocyte gene and biological pathway biomarkers could direct personalized surgical intervention, including vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, responsive neurostimulation and emerging techniques of stem cell and gene therapy in temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nCurrently, medical management of intractable TLE is based on the clinical diagnosis of intractable TLE. A more tailored approach for TLE treatment, based on mechanistically separate categories of disease of high and low seizure frequency, will allow more personalized pharmacologic therapy directed at TLE genomic and biological pathway-specific pathophysiology for the high and low seizure frequency categories of disease. This more personalized genomic-based therapy should produce improved control of temporal lobe epilepsy, including reduced seizure frequency.",

The construct created by this method results with no foreign sequences, making the strains markerless mutants. This means that one has the potential to make genetic strains with multiple mutations and can therefore contribute to nearly every area of biological research. Deletion of the Coccidioides CPS1 gene resulted in a mutant strain that shows efficacy and safety as a live attenuated vaccine to prevent coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) that is being developed for commercial production as a canine vaccine. The markerless cps1 deletion mutant may be critical for getting regulatory approval of a live attenuated cps1 vaccine for humans. Ultimately, one wishes to determine how genes\u2014and the proteins they encode\u2014function in the intact organism. Although it may sound counterintuitive, one of the most direct ways to find out what a gene does is to see what happens to the organism when that gene is missing. Studying mutant organisms that have acquired changes or deletions in their nucleotide sequences is a time-honored practice in biology. Because mutations can interrupt cellular processes, mutants often hold the key to understanding gene function.

Different periodic fringes are projected onto the object sequentially and the reflected fringes are measured at different times. A minimum of three sets of fringes are needed for reconstruction and more fringes are often used to improve accuracy.

This is a one-size-fits-all flap that has an adhesive lining at the top, allowing for adhesion to the patient\u2019s perineum and across the patient\u2019s back thighs. The flap will not interfere with the delivery of the infant as it is located inferior to the vaginal introitus. This will create a sealed barrier between the sterile field and any defecation so that the infant will not encounter fecal matter. Providers can then focus on supporting the patient through the pushing process instead of wiping up fecal matter and disposing of it to reestablish a sterile area. If necessary, the flap can be easily removed to expose the anus. Bowel movements are common during the second stage of labor due to the muscles utilized during pushing the infant down the birth canal. The embarrassment from the bowel movements often distracts or causes added stress for the patient during childbirth.

Instead of using binary encoding methods such as frequency resolved optical gating and on-off keying, this invention encodes vital information into the polarization state of the light pulse. This new approach decreases measurement error by generating a key code that uniquely identifies a transmitter and receiver pair. The invention also leverages the diattenuation and retardance of birefringent objects to modify the polarization state of the reflected light pulse. To distinguish these changes, the transmitted light pulse can be duplicated or sent in triplicate pairs, and the modifications in the polarization state can be detected by the receiver. Conventional LiDAR devices rely on the reflectance of the object, and objects with high absorption and light scattering tend to reflect less light back to the receiver. This innovative approach improves on this limitation by considering the diattenuation and retardance of birefringent objects, which can alter the polarization state of the light pulse.

The phase-based camera, coupled with existing cameras and sensors normally equipped on autonomous vehicles, allows for detection and viewing objects through fog, smoke, or other atmospheric obstructions. The system consists of a lens, phase light modulation (PLM) device, 2-dimension detector array such as complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) imager and a light source, such as a collimated laser, which illuminates the object. Return signal from an object\u2014for example, a car in fog\u2014is captured by camera with a PLM which is situated in the optical path between the camera lens and 2-dimentional detector array. In the system, two or more images are captured by camera while displaying phase and/or amplitude profiles which are orthogonal with each other. The images are subtracted to eliminate background and deconvolved to enhance the feature inside the fog or other disruptive media.

This is primarily proposed for medical imaging applications through living tissue. This noninvasive technique only uses light in the optical wave band and works with standard off-the-shelf camera technology\u2013 potentially even with mobile phone camera sensors, leveraging the huge potential of carefully designed optical systems paired with sophisticated algorithms.\n\nThe plan to develop such a camera needs a Synthetic Wavelength Holography (SWH) to image through scattering media and around corners with a demonstrated resolution of up to 800\u03bcm. However, the current SWH approach relies on the acquisition of sequentially captured images and is extremely susceptible to motion, making imaging through living tissue impossible with the current method. The current SWH technique also relies on expensive modulation/imaging hardware.

Methods of administration for a therapeutic may include electric brain stimulation and/or pharmacological inhibitors of specific protein expression. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a prevalent eating disorder seen primarily in females, which significantly disrupts life and health, to the point of reaching fatality in extreme cases, with the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. AN is characterized by self-starvation, fear of gaining weight, and excessive exercise, but also is often co-diagnosed with other psychiatric and emotional disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder. These characteristics of AN suggest the neural circuits regulating eating behavior and the neural circuits regulating emotion interact extensively and significantly to control AN development.

After the two CubeSats are close enough to each other the lights turn off and a two-step process starts to dock the two CubeSats. The first step is to deploy of an inflated balloon structure, and the second step involves turning the electromagnets. Autonomous docking is an important part of spacecraft innovation. It makes possible for spacecrafts to link together, which can allow for in-space assembly and on-orbit servicing. Current docking spacecraft docking methods are more prone to cause collisions and subsequent failures during the rendezvous and proximity operations. The invention proposes using electromagnetic levitations as it has been proved to be one of the safest approaches for autonomous docking. The main goal of the technology is to have two spacecrafts to dock with each other using the electromagnetic levitation method by using the onboard systems which will also enable a minimal use of active thrusters and fuel. Applications include autonomous docking for spacecrafts, formation flying, surveillance, security, and fault detection for smaller non-contact docking. Advantages include more freedom of error in the docking error, reduced change of leakage problems, and a safer approach for docking spacecrafts.",

    "published_date": "7/5/2023",
    "ip_description": "This technology is a method for measuring heliostats for solar energy applications, as well as any large optical surface composed of second-surface mirrors. A small diffraction grating, which is a 1D, 2D, or 3D periodic phase and/or amplitude modulation, is embedded within the glass substrate of a second-surface mirror. Light from a metrology system propagates through this grating before and after reflection, allowing it to be directed to non-specular directions to be measured by the optical system. Multiple gratings can be written in a single layer or multiple layers in the glass to provide additional diffraction orders or more complex control of the reflected wavefronts. These gratings can enable metrology of large specular surfaces with compact optical setups, such as a point source illumination and reflection into a camera, and can also be used to re-direct a small amount of sunlight to a direction offset from the specular direction to allow measurement of the mirror orientation while it directs most sunlight to a receiver for thermal energy generation. The gratings are written with ultrafast laser pulses, with pulse duration in the femtosecond to picosecond range, to impart index of refraction variation, scattering, or both, providing phase and/or amplitude modulation. Large optomechanical structures, such as heliostats used for solar energy concentration, require sub-milliradian precision surface metrology. Due to the large size and long focal lengths of these systems, accurately measuring these surfaces with a compact metrology system is difficult. Several techniques have been developed to overcome these limitations, such as photogrammetry, which is a process of attaching components to diffusely scatter light to the heliostat mirrors; however, attaching components increases measurement uncertainty, degrades robustness, and can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Phase gratings, which do not scatter or absorb light can be more useful for directing light differently based on wavelength, and gratings can be designed to modify the spectrum of reflected light.",

There are fundamental challenges with efficiently and optimally delivering light and (ultra)sound through coupling materials that are placed between a device that emits and/or detects light and/or sound and coalignment is often desirable. Since air is not an efficient coupling material for (ultra)sound, water-based materials that have similar acoustic properties to tissue are often used for efficient coupling. However, liquid water does not exhibit attractive mechanical properties when integrated into many devices or administered at the tissue interface. As a result, water-based and rubber-based gels are sometimes employed since they possess much better mechanical stability than water.

Cryptococcal meningitis is a severe fungal infection of the central nervous system. Worldwide, nearly 220,000 new cases of cryptococcal meningitis occur each year, resulting in an estimated 181,000 deaths. Most of the illness and deaths are estimated to occur in resource-limited countries, among people living with HIV.

However, cryptococcal meningitis is still a major problem where HIV prevalence is high and where access to healthcare may be limited. This infection is extremely life threatening and has a high mortality rate. Despite the severity of the condition, there are few, if any, effective therapeutic options depending on the severity.

    "ip_description": "This technology uses \u2018cellulose sponges\u2019 that can be used to grow pick-and-eat crops without soil. The inventors have tested diverse cellulose derivatives and have determined the best performers. Hydroxyethyl methylcellulose was shown in testing to have a higher water-retention property, higher durability, low density and malleability, and equal performance when compared to current rockwool systems. The crosslinked nature of the technology overcomes the common drawback of current sponges\u2019 material releasing lots of dust and loose fiber that can be dangerous to humans in closed environments. The technology does not threaten respiratory systems while maintaining lower density and high water-retention properties. The other challenge is needed soil to grow crops with the sponges. To overcome this challenge and simplify the cellulose-based plant growth system, the technology controlled the component-structure-property-processing of cellulose materials for plant growth without soil. Furthermore, by testing diverse cellulose derivatives, the inventors identified the best performers to grow pick-and-eat crops, such as lettuce. Cellulose is the most abundant natural biopolymer with a global reserve of up to 75 billion tons from a variety of sustainable sources such as wood, plants, and algae. Due to the good safety profile of these biopolymers to humans and the environment, cellulose and its derivatives are widely used as a binder, thickener, emulsifier, and dispersing agent in various applications such as food, cosmetic and personal care, pharmaceutics, construction, and agriculture. Food-grade cellulose derivatives were crosslinked with food-grade citric acid to construct hydrogels with high water-retention properties. This cellulose hydrogel was buried under the soil and successfully grew a plant with the benefit of providing water and nutrients longer than just soil itself. Although direct plant growth on cellulose materials without soil would be more convenient, the small pores in the cellulose hydrogel prevent the roots from penetrating through and thus, a plant supporting system, such as soil, is required.",

The inventors developed a fluorescence polarization (FP)-based HTS assay to target reference MTases, an essential enzyme to methylate the 5\u2019-cap of viral RNA genome on SARS-CoV-2 and flavivirus. Pilot screening demonstrated that the HTS assay was very robust and identified two candidate inhibitors. Binding studies indicated that these molecules bound directly to the essential enzymes with similar low micromolar affinity. Moreover, the inventors further demonstrated that these molecules significantly inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and Zika virus in cell-based assays at concentrations not causing significant cytotoxicity. Overall, these molecules represent novel and promising candidates to further develop broad-spectrum inhibitors for management of viral infections. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic still persists even after vaccines have been introduced. Similarly, flaviviruses that cause diseases like Dengue Fever, West Nile Virus, Zika, and Japanese Encephalitis have caused outbreaks all over the world and there are only four working vaccines on the market for those conditions. These viruses often are zoonotic or use animals to infect humans. The single-stranded RNA allows for the viruses to quickly mutate and thus evade immune systems and human innovations, making it difficult for vaccines to remain 100% accurate.

By using a paper-based microfluidic chip, this invention provides rapid detection of Perfluorooctanoic acid PFOAs in a lab. The procedure uses commonly available reagents to flow through a microfluidic chip while also loading it with the testing sample. Within 30 minutes of loading the sample, the scientist is able to gather their data. The readout time can be as low as five minutes. Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) comprise around 10,000 different human-made agents that can be added to liquids to decrease surface tension with other solids, liquids and gasses. They are commonly used in carpeting, upholstery, apparel, floor wax, textiles, firefighting foam and sealants. PFAS are comprised of carbon chains linked to fluorine, resulting in the strongest polar covalent bond between carbon and another atom; a strong bond means they do not degrade quickly. These inert chemicals pose a potential risk to humans and their monitoring needs improvement. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a specific type of PFAS, has been acknowledged as causing significant environmental damage to human health, being present in humans at a level of four parts per billion when 70 parts per trillion is considered the safe lifetime health advisory in drinking water by the EPA. Federal agencies are setting advisory levels of exposure and many state agencies are also enforcing regulations of limits on PFOA and PFAS contamination in drinking water. Current testing methods include high performance liquid chromatography, using methylene blue, or using a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP). Using these types of detection requires training and can also be very expensive. Furthermore, the MIP process requires more investigation and the chromatography can take multiple days to return results.

    "ip_description": "This technology is a novel heart valve and deployment system that maintains eccentric geometries while optimizing valve function and hemodynamics, reducing adverse events. The asymmetrical leaflet design features two identical mirrored larger leaflets and one shorter leaflet. Traditional symmetric leaflet design features three equal leaflets that rely on diastolic closure with all leaflets meeting in the center and small bending forces needed in systole to open all leaflets. The larger leaflets preferentially open along the long axis of the ellipse and asymmetrical leaflets coopt off the center of the ellipse, shifting the cooption point along the long axis to increase the opening area. Increasing the angle of the commissural attachment further reduces the diastolic stresses. The leaflet configuration relies on alignment of the long axis of the valve between the commissures of the bicuspid aortic valve, which no delivery system can control/image at this time. Heart valve disease, such as Bicuspid Aortic stenosis, often results in eccentric valve geometry and orifices. The aortic valve separates the left lower heart chamber (left ventricle) and the body\u2019s main artery (aorta). Flaps of tissue (cusps) on the valve open and close with each heartbeat and make sure blood flows in the right direction. Usually, the aortic valve has three cusps. A bicuspid valve has only two cusps. Rarely, some people are born with an aortic valve that has one cusp (unicuspid) or four cusps (quadricuspid).

    "ip_description": "A multi-omics clock analyzes multiple layers of omics data with machine learning to predict remaining lifespan of mammals, particularly for animal model studies. Large omics data sets may be used from combinations of genomics, proteomics, lipids, etc. available from blood or other simple sample collection. This tool can robustly capture changes in this metric following short-term treatment with an anti-aging intervention. This timing reflects the likely point in life where a mammal might expect to receive such an intervention in the clinic. These drugs can then be prioritized for detailed examination in more costly preclinical longevity studies. Over the past four decades hundreds of interventions have been identified that extend lifespan in invertebrate model systems of aging. One major bottleneck in translating these interventions into clinical therapies to increase healthy longevity and treat age-associated disease in humans is the high cost in both time and resources associated with conducting longevity studies in preclinical mammalian models. In principle, one solution to this problem is to identify early- to mid-life biomarkers that can predict lifespan and other late-life markers of healthy aging. However, aging is driven by a complex interplay between many molecular and cellular processes, and biomarkers that provide consistent predictive efficacy across interventions, tissues, and disease types have been historically elusive. Recent advances use omics data to develop biomarker panels\u2014tens to thousands of individual molecular measurements (e.g., epigenetic markers, single-gene expression levels, metabolite levels)\u2014to develop predictive \u201cclocks\u201d that can, to some degree, accurately predict biological age or related age-associated metrics.

    "published_date": "5/7/2024",
    "ip_description": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory RNA molecules that bind to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and affect the stability or translational efficiency of the bound mRNAs. Single or dual-luciferase reporter systems have been successfully used to identify miRNA target genes in mammalian cells, however, they are not sensitive enough to verify miRNA\u2013target gene relationships in insect cell lines. The promoters for the target luciferase in insect cells are too weak to drive sufficient expression of the target luciferase in insect cells. This technology replaces the promoter used for the mammalian cells with a different promoter that has the potential to bind in insect cells. The promoter psiCHECK-2-TK has suitable insect cell luciferase activity ratios regardless of the cell line. PsiCHECK-2-TK was able to detect the interaction between Helicoverpa armigera miRNA9a and its target in both mammalian and H. zea cell lines; furthermore, psiCHECK-2-TK with the target sequence, HzMasc accurately differentiated between H. zea cell lines with or without the negative regulation factor of HzMasc. This demonstrates that psiCHECK-2-TK can be used to functionally characterize small RNA target genes in both mammalian and insect cells. Small non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), are important for regulating gene expression. miRNAs regulate many cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, reproduction, death, metabolism, and development. miRNAs will interact with its target gene through base pairing, but it is very specific and there needs to be a minimum of eight similar base pairs. Currently, there is only one commercially available dual-luciferase (a photoprotein that is bioluminescent when bonded to its target) reporter system that can verify RNA genes. With only one dual-luciferase on the market there is a possibility of many miRNAs that are not being identified do the specificity required. Having the technology to alter and bind to these miRNAs can be useful for the pesticide industry for the development of a new pesticide.",

The Superior cells have a differential gene expression signature as compared to Inferior cells of 264 genes that was positively associated with metastatic prostate cancer in humans. Of significant interest is that muscle-resident tumor cells differentially expressed 84 genes compared to both the Inferior and Superior cancer cells, highlighting the unique environment of the active mouse muscle. Human prostate cancer cell lines are particularly difficult to establish, and most existing cell lines do not exhibit features commonly seen in human prostate cancer.

Globally, colorectal cancer was the second leading cause of cancer death in 2021. Research suggests that collagen, a major structural protein, plays a pivotal role in cancer development and metastasis, and by extension patient prognosis. Collagen surrounding tumor cells undergoes structural changes that can be quantitatively studied with second harmonic generation (SHG), a subset of multiphoton microscopy (MPM). MPM as an imaging modality is difficult to implement in an endoscope because of the complex and expensive miniaturized scanning components required.

    "ip_description": "Existing corner cube reflectors introduce unwanted polarization change to incident light. This invention provides a solution to remove this polarization change and thereby reduces polarization dependent loss and improves the performance of the reflector. This solution can be applied to both mirror-based and prism-based corner cube reflectors. This invention also includes a method to design and manufacture a corner cube reflector to precisely control the change of polarization using a compensation filter and/or coating. The polarization compensation filter is made of at least one layer of patterned birefringent material. In some embodiment, the filter is used to preserve the polarization of the incoming light, such that the polarization of the reflected light is the same as the incoming light for a range of angle of entry. In other embodiments, the filter is used to change the polarization of the incoming light to a predefined polarization, such that the polarization of the reflected light is equal to the predefined polarization for a range of angle of entry. Corner cube reflector is used extensively in many optical systems to redirect an incoming beam of light back toward its incoming direction. One advantage of the corner cube reflector is that it can reflect light at a range of angle of entry, making it an indispensable optical component for alignment. Another advantage is its small compact size, which can be tiled in an array to cover large areas. Applications of corner cube reflector include spectroscopy, road sign, free space optical communication, positioning, land survey, laser cavity, distance or time-of-flight measurement, interferometry, navigation, and precision alignment. A corner cube reflector is made of three intersecting and perpendicular flat reflectors. There are generally two types: one made of three flat mirrors, and one made of three-sided glass prism. In both types, light is reflected by each surface three times, either by the mirrors or by total internal reflection (TIR) at the glass-air interfaces. One disadvantage of the corner cube reflector is the change of polarization state after the reflections which is caused by the reflections of light and by the change of its direction of propagation. The latter change component is geometric in nature. Both change components depend on the location and angle of entry. Generally, reflector made of metal-coated mirror has smaller polarization change than reflector made of glass prism. For applications where the preservation of the polarization state is critical, a corner cube reflector that does not change the polarization state of the incoming light is needed.",

Furthermore, the bone volume (mm3) demonstrates that the composite ceramic scaffolds support more bone growth into the scaffold than pure PBT or PLA. Long bone segment defects typically result from extensive bone resection from cancer or severe extremity trauma. In weight-bearing long bones, the bone is often unable to heal properly following surgical reconstruction, and the result is non-union. These defects are difficult to treat and may require amputation or endoprosthetic replacement. Patients experiencing these defects may undergo multiple surgeries with outcomes of reconstruction and grafting comparable to those of amputation, though neither is optimal. Applications include orthopedic surgery, resorbable bone scaffolds, 3D printed surgical solutions, and composite filaments for 3D printing. Advantages include high strength, customizable shape, high biocompatibility, and customizable resorption rate.",

The resulting high sulfur content polymers are referred to as Chalcogenide Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Polymers (CHIP) materials have improved polymer compatibility and efficient crosslinking. Furthermore, this technology suppresses \"reversion,\" the loss of rubber stiffness over time, which is an undesirable quality.\n\nVulcanization of rubber and other polymeric materials is a well-established method for enhancing physical properties by chemical crosslinking. Vulcanized materials are generally more thermally, chemically, and physically robust than their non-vulcanized analogs. These increased characteristics are attributed to the formation of carbon-sulfur bonds which allow for bridging of the polymer chains by varying numbers of sulfur atoms to form crosslinked networks. While accelerator additives are used to increase the speed of vulcanization, thus permitting polymerization at lower temperatures and greater efficiency, vulcanization still requires high temperatures and suffers from inefficient mixing of components due to poor incompatibility which results in incomplete curing and undesirable decomposition. Hence, there is a need for technology for improved polymer compatibility and lower-temperature curing.\n\nApplications:\n* Tire rubber vulcanization\n* Latex manufacturing\n* Suitable for natural, synthetic, or a combination of materials\n\nAdvantages:\n* Improved solubility in tire rubber precursors compared to elemental sulfur and improved crosslinking\n* \"Reversion\" suppression",

By understanding the genetic makeup of animals and insects, we can learn how to improve human life. Viruses that affect crustaceans may be able to provide insight into genetic promoters that can interact with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.\n\nThere are different types of genetic expression. A gene can be expressed within the same species (i.e. homologous expression) or in a different species than the one in which it originates (i.e. heterologous). Baculovirus penaei (BP) has an affinity to bind with many different types of tissue, allowing it to be used to promote gene expression for various species. Genetic expression can occur for constitutive genes: those that are always expressed and for inducible genes and those that are only expressed under certain conditions or when their products are deemed necessary. BP can be a potential promoter for both types of genes.\n\nInitially discovered in 1974, Penaeus vannamei singly enveloped nuclear polyhedrosis virus (PsSNPV), was the first shrimp virus to be identified. Over the years, it has been analyzed using transmission electron microscopy and was categorized as similar to baculovirus that infects insects. This conclusion was reached based on the identification of a part of its genomic sequence, while the rest of the genome was unknown.\n\nCurrently, there are limited methods of promoting gene expression across species. Bacterial genetic promoters show some potential, but there has yet to be a solution.

A premature stop codon associated with Lmod2 causes truncation of Lmod2. This innovation is the use of antisense for blocking the system that recognizes and prevents the premature stop codon, thereby allowing the truncated/mutant protein synthesis. Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body. Cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure. The main types of cardiomyopathies include dilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Treatment \u2014 which might include medications, surgically implanted devices, heart surgery or, in severe cases, a heart transplant \u2014 depends on the type of cardiomyopathy and how serious it is. There might be no signs or symptoms in the early stages of cardiomyopathy, but as the condition advances, signs and symptoms usually appear and tend to get worse unless treated. Leiomodin-2 (Lmod2) is a regulator of the actin thin filament lengths within the heart muscle. Knockout of Lmod2 has been shown to result in dilated cardiomyopathy.

The small cells are mounted to the module\u2019s front window on small copper/ceramic substrates. An array of lenses molded into a single sheet of glass is attached to the front of the apparatus to concentrate direct sunlight onto each of the MJ cells while transmitting diffuse light to the single junction cells. A very fast molding process for manufacturing the lens arrays is described in which relatively cold molds are used to form the lenses into a sheet of hot, soft glass. To maximize optical coupling efficiency and provide tolerance to wrong pointing, the concentrating optics include a second spherical glass lens and flat glass plate bonded to the MJ cell.

    "ip_description": "Canonical WNT (Wingless/integrase 1) signaling is an important developmental pathway that has attracted increased attention for anti-cancer drug discovery. Researchers at the University of Arizona are investigating utility for the compounds herein for the treatment of colorectal cancer as well as potential disease modifying agents for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Therapeutic opportunities exist for several malignancies and for neurodegenerative diseases. Several WNT inhibitor molecules are in clinical trials with differing mechanisms of action including porcupine and tankyrase inhibitors. Recently, numerous new biological processes and targets related to the WNT pathway have been discovered. Among these targets, the tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase CLKS have been reported to modulate pre-mRNA splicing and as such modulate WNT activity. There are a reported five CLK inhibitors (often denoted CLK2 inhibitors) in clinical trials for different malignancies and regeneration studies. These small molecules could play a crucial role in the delivery of anti-cancer drugs due to their ability to inhibit cell growth. By just inhibiting CLK pathways the WNT pathway gene expression will be reduced, showing that they play a role with one another. Applications include tumor treatment, cancer treatment, and gastrointestinal cancers. Advantages include helping deliver anti-cancer drugs effectively and no added toxins for effective treatment.",

Guidance of needles is required in maximizing efficacy of, and minimizing complications of percutaneous procedures to get specific tissues. While the current standard of external imaging-based guidance (through x-rays/fluoroscopically/CT, medical ultrasound, or MRI) is very powerful, there are limitations. Patients undergoing lung biopsy are often instructed to hold their breath while a CT scan is performed to determine if the trajectory of the needle is in line with the target lesion.

While quantum computing exists today, one of the challenges limiting its usefulness is the problem of noise or faults in the information, resulting in information loss or expensive error correction. This creates increased costs, limiting its value over classical computing. This technology eliminates the need for some components other photonic quantum computers use, thereby reducing the amount of information loss and improving scalability over other solutions. Applications include Quantum computing and Quantum photonics. Advantages include Compact form factor, Low photon loss, Low overhead, High fault tolerance, Improved construction and operational cost, and Room-temp operation.",

The architecture presents a potential blueprint for realizing global-scale quantum networks in the near future.\n\nGlobal markets for quantum applications maintain high growth across many disciplines during this decade despite the many problems of the early 2020s. Many high-profile companies are investing and researching in the area, and it is likely they will begin integrating hybrid systems within the decade. Given that this innovation stands to impact global-scale networks, it may be extremely worthwhile to explore.\n\nMultiplexing allows higher single-photon probabilities and lower contamination from higher-order photon states.

CMN prevents the protein from continuing to splice. While the current treatment methods do not prevent intein splicing, based on a study done on mice, CMN has been shown to be effective at reducing the fungal load of cryptococcosis and may also be extended for use against other intein splicing pathogens. Cryptococcosis is a pulmonary or disseminated infection acquired by inhalation of soil contaminated with the encapsulated yeasts Cryptococcus neoformans or C. gattii. Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii affects hundreds of millions of people a year, with almost 200,000 deaths annually. In immunocompromised individuals, such as those suffering from AIDS/HIV, fungal infection is the leading cause of death. Patients who had COVID-19 are also more likely to become infected by these fungal diseases. One strategy for treating these infections in humans is splicing on inteins from a proprotein precursor that is essential for proteins hosting inteins elements.

Here, the inventors have created four improved ways to manufacture polymers. The first is to create it at its mid-stress point, the second is to make the polymer with a shifting neutral axis, the third method uses polymers to provide support at high-stress points along with the polymer, and the fourth is to use fibers as the support system. All these methods increase the amount of stress that a device can undergo, and it can be used for a longer time. Method and process of making polymeric devices primarily applies to medical and healthcare devices (e.g. heart valve), but also includes polymeric materials for sports, industry, manufacturing, etc. Current polymers are manufactured in a rigid neutral state, meaning it has to experience full force in all directions when bent. They are not given any extra support, leaving them weaker than they could be. The new methods of manufacturing polymers in a partially flexed state will allow it to experience less stress in its flexed states. Current polymers do not apply neutral axis shifting, but changing this would help decrease wear over time on the structure of the material. Manufacturing polymers with a cyclic shift in the neutral axis will increase the life of the polymer as it allows the polymer to experience constant stress and strain over a rotating axis. Current polymers and resins are usually made as a whole part, without any support, or extra support at areas of high tension. Polymers can also be strengthened by increasing the amount of support they have at their high-stress point, and also ensuring that there is no intra-material failure. Another method that is being proposed to increase the strength of polymers is to add fibers that increase durability by supporting the polymer bi-axially. By using a bulking polymer at high-stress locations polymers are better able to distribute the stress. Along with using bulking polymers to strengthen the structure, adding fibers can also increase the strength of a material.",

This effect can be controlled by the system to perform a progressive envelopment of an intended target in a microgravity environment. The system has no dependency on mechanical components. This avoids system complexity, reduces overall system mass/volume, and keeps power requirements at a minimum. Additionally, as the system only exerts small amounts of force on targets in microgravity, mishandling in the form of unwanted spinning or potential collisions is highly unlikely. Tethers provide solutions to a variety of problems in space. For example, the Space Surveillance Network tracks over 27,000 pieces of orbital debris, but there are many more pieces too small to be tracked which still pose a threat to human and robotic spaceflight. Tethers offer an inexpensive and efficient solution while maintaining low chances of mishandling. Additionally, there are 105 countries to date that have at least one satellite in space, and the number of man-made devices will only increase in the coming decades. These devices must currently hold propellant and a mechanism for dispersing it, but this can be replaced by tethers which will precisely reposition the devices in a variety of desirable methods.

One major limitation to developing new medical therapies is the lack of human relevant model systems. Here, the inventors harvested human pituitary adenoma tissue during transsphenoidal surgery from patients to generate organoids (hPITOs). They utilized several methods to investigate the organoid model, including a high-throughput drug screen that demonstrated patient-specific drug responses of hPITOs amongst each adenoma subtype. The reported findings of this study are conclusive and demonstrate that from these patient-derived organoids the treatment of Cushing\u2019s Disease may be improved.

    "ip_description": "This invention describes modulating the temperature of the solution in an electrospray needle prior to charge-detection mass spectrometry (CD/MS) to enable discrimination between the individual stabilities of multiple forms of viral particles that may be present in an AAV preparation. This increased discrimination provides the operator with a unique ability to determine the stability of the fully assembled viral particles even if the AAV preparation comprises partially filled virions, over-filled virions, and/or various assemblies of capsid proteins lacking a nucleic acid cargo. Gene therapy and vaccine delivery using adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a vector has emerged as a novel therapeutic modality that has the potential to lead to substantial disease modification in many monogenic disorders, or perhaps even cures. The interest in this approach has been boosted by the recent approval of two AAV-based gene therapies by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Over the last 5 years the number of clinical trials for commercial use have grown tremendously and AAVs are being used more now than ever before. Differential scanning fluorimetry or differential scanning calorimetry are commonly used to measure the thermal stability of AAVs, but these global methods are unable to distinguish the stability of different AAV subpopulations in the same sample. The goal of this invention is to characterize the stability and unfolding pathways of adeno-associated viral (AAV) capsids, which compose the packaging for efficient viral delivery. Conventional methods for this include charge detection-mass spectrometry (CD-MS) which reports on the solvent exposed surface area of the complex. The method proposed here would be a novel improvement upon current thermal unfolding techniques. Applications include gene therapy, vaccine development, creating model systems, and medical research and development. Advantages include the ability to characterize stability, characterize unfolding pathways, and screen, optimize, and select viral clones.",

By decreasing HMGB1 binding to DNA, cell inflammation can be significantly reduced, thus preventing further cell damage. This technology can be used in a large spectrum of diseases, such as: diabetic complications, hypertension, systemic inflammation, acute chronic heart, kidney, and liver diseases. Chronic cell inflammation plays a pivotal role in cell damage and inflammation to the body\u2019s cells is a major side effect in many different diseases. Current technologies that aim at trying to reduce cell inflammation are to supplement the body with foods that have anti-inflammatory properties, as well as the use of infrared led exposure.

This is an improvement on previous technology that increases sensitivity of defect detection in device-relevant triple cation perovskites. The development of next-generation flexible optoelectronic devices has focused on the incorporation of solution processable lead halide perovskite materials as an active layer because of their high-power conversion efficiency and easy accessibility. In the last decade, the certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells have leaped from 3.8% to a maximum of 25.2% reached in 2020. Although various routes such as compositional engineering, interface modification, surface passivation and encapsulation have been attempted to improve device efficiency, the record for flexible perovskite solar cells is advancing rather slowly, especially in modules. As a result, novel techniques are needed to examine recent work more closely to expedite innovation toward higher PCEs by characterizing and controlling defect populations and improve long-term stability by understanding underlying chemical-physical-electronic equilibration mechanisms to enhance scalability and enable broad applicability. In 2016, a novel \u201ctriple cation\u201d reproducible perovskite with more pure and highly monolithic grains was developed that demonstrated consistent PCEs above 20%. Since then, these perovskites have attracted a broad interest based on their increased absorption, improved stability, decrease in interfacial recombination and number of defects. While their efficiency approximates silicon\u2019s lab record, lattice distortions, grain boundaries, impurities in the perovskite\u2019s crystal lattice and most importantly the connection with other layers contribute to phase instabilities, electronic defects and ion migration that are exacerbated under photon flux, heat, humidity, and/or electrical bias. Once ions leave the lattice they propagate through the active layer not only as defects, but also as active chemical species. In the last 5 years, the interest in quantifying this number of defects has grown tremendously, which caused a surge in the number of methodologies to detect or predict them.

Adaptive profile poling is promising to realize high nonlinear efficiency with strong material second-order nonlinearity. Nonlinear efficiency can actually increase quadratically with length using this method. It was shown that the optical momentum mismatch caused by the thickness variation of thin-film Lithium Niobate wafers limits the overall nonlinear efficiency. In contrast to standard periodic poling where the domain inversion period is fixed, a near-ideal sinc function second-harmonic spectrum can be recovered. Lithium Niobate is inert and difficult to etch. For decades, waveguides have used ion diffusion or proton exchange which suffer small index contrast and bulky, non-scalable, and expensive devices which require a large driving voltage. Furthermore, uncertainties in the ion implantation depth and chemical-mechanical polishing rate cause thickness variations of the device layer. This non-uniformity has prevented the repeatable demonstration of high-performance nonlinear devices, as well as the large-scale photonic circuits based on thin-film Lithium Niobate.

    "ip_description": "Second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy has become a powerful modality for imaging a diverse range of tissues. A preliminary study demonstrated that non-imaging, randomly sampled SHG intensity measurements are likely sufficient to distinguish normal colorectal tissue from tumor/tumor-adjacent tissue with digital simulation of random sampling. While SHG images have been used endoscopically for tumor diagnosis before, the process of taking an SHG image complicates the endoscope and sets lower limits on the size, due to the necessity of scanning mechanisms. The novelty of the proposed non-imaging measurements is the feasibility of a much simpler and smaller endoscope that returns a quantitative value instead of relying on an observer to interpret an image. Colon cancer is the third most common cancer in the United States, excluding skin cancers, and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths when men and women are combined. Despite the high death and case counts, the case rates and death rates have been decreasing the last few years. This type of cancer has a 65% 5-year survival rate. The reason for these decreases is in part due to better screening. This technology will improve screening and result in a continued decrease in cases and deaths. Non-imaging SHG measurements will be used in colonoscopies and other endoscopic procedures to identify and differentiate normal versus cancerous tissue and identify surgical margins in real-time. This would replace conventional methods for sampling and identifying suspicious samples as it is much more reliable since it gives a quantitative assessment for whether there is cancerous tissue present. The reason that is better is because it is definitive, and patients don\u2019t need to rely on a doctor interpreting an image correctly.

The CLN1 and CLN2 genes regulate the production of these enzymes, respectively. Batten Disease, or Neural Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL), is a family of rare diseases caused by the autosomal recessive genetic mutations. Batten Disease is an inherited genetic disorder that affects the function of lysosomes and result in imbalance of the homeostasis of the cell and a consequential build-up of proteins and lipids. These diseases are currently incurable and healthcare providers focus on treating the symptoms of the disorder. The CLN1 gene is responsible for the production of the enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) and deficiency of this enzyme leads to abnormal buildup of lipids and proteins. In CLN1 disease, symptoms can be seen before age 1 and progress rapidly. Developmental skills such as standing, walking, and talking are not achieved or are gradually lost. Children often develop seizures by age 2 and eventually become bind. By age 3, children often are completely dependent upon caregivers and may need a feeding tube. Most affected children die in early to mid-childhood. For CLN2 disease, the tripeptidyl peptidase (TTP1) enzyme is insufficiently active. Developmental delay will usually begin around the age of 2 and children will develop seizures and begin to gradually lose their ability to walk and speak. Brief, involuntary jerks in muscles or muscle groups typically begin around age 4-5. By age 6, children often are completely dependent upon caregivers and may need a feeding tube. Most children with CLN2 disease will die between the ages of 6-12; however, symptoms can develop around this time in some children, and they will experience a slower disease progression, possibly living into their teenage years.

    "ip_description": "This technology is a robust and efficient quantum network that allows for a large number of entangled states to be delivered over the nodes in the network. The network makes use of simultaneous discrete variable (DV) and continuous variable (CV) entanglement unlike existing state of the art quantum networks, making it ideal for serving as the backbone of a quantum internet. Quantum communication networks are important because they provide a higher level of security than traditional communications. To protect traditional communications, encryption is typically applied. But as computers get faster, they can break encryption protocols more easily, and encryption often has other security flaws and can slow down communications. Quantum communication, on the other hand, is inherently more secure and has the potential for higher speeds. Hybrid CV-DV quantum states can be entangled and measured when working with light-based communications. Traditionally, when creating light-based quantum networks, the light is either treated like a particle, leading to DV-based quantum technologies, or the light is treated like a wave, leading to CV-based quantum technologies. However, recent research has suggested a third approach, the hybrid CV-DV approach, which does both. This technology serves to build upon that research to create a practical and effective implementation of hybrid CV-DV quantum communications. Applications: Quantum communication networks, Quantum internet, Quantum key distribution (QKD). Advantages: Robust, Efficient, Enables distribution of large number of entangled states.",

    "ip_description": "University of Arizona researchers have developed a method to offset carbon emissions for industries where carbon-neutral operations are particularly challenging (e.g., airlines, shipping). This invention offers a method to offset carbon emissions for industries where carbon-neutral operations are particularly challenging (e.g., airlines, shipping). This invention offers a scalable solution to efficiently extract CO2 from the atmosphere by utilizing a novel combination of a UArizona patented, low-cost photobioreactor system, which has an excellent track record of growing photosynthetic algae, and a particle filtration system. Due to the intrinsic scalability of this invention, it has a potential to provide the most cost-effective solution to massive (hundreds of Ktons to Gtons-level) CO2 extraction, thereby contributing to reducing the impact of climate change and meeting demands for such capabilities if carbon taxes are introduced worldwide. Transitioning industrial processes worldwide to carbon-neutral operations is a necessity yet an enormously expensive technological and economic challenge. If companies can utilize reliable sources of carbon offsetting, then the total world emissions will greatly decrease, and we can slow the impacts of global warming. Energy is the number one cause of greenhouse gas emissions which is why this invention is an attractive alternative for shipping companies, airlines, and data centers where energy and fuel use is inevitable. Greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 43% from 1990 to 2015. If the number keeps growing at that rate, global warming will be irreversible, and the impact will be massive. As more and more companies pledge to become carbon neutral, it has become difficult to find scalable solutions that are cost-effective. The invention described here offers a scalable solution to efficiently extract CO2 from ocean water (a gigantic reservoir of CO2 that is coupled to the atmosphere) by utilizing a novel combination of photobioreactor and particle filtration system. Three regions of the world (East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and the United States) account for about 74% of the total emissions.

    "published_date": "1/4/2022",
    "ip_description": "This invention provides compositions and method of pain treatment using a mixture of an opioid receptor agonist in combination with an adrenoreceptor modulator compound. The opioid receptor agonist may be a clinically-used drug, and the adrenoreceptor modulator compound is a novel small molecule. Proof-of-concept testing in animals has shown analgesic effect without reward behavior. Opioids continue to be widely used for pain treatment. However, constant opioid treatment is accompanied with serious undesirable effects including drowsiness and mental clouding, nausea and emesis, constipation and in many cases dependence and addiction. Continuous use of opioid therapy also develops analgesic tolerance and hyperalgesia in many patients. These unwanted effects significantly diminish the patients\u2019 quality of life. The mechanisms for these side effects are still largely unclear. However, one particular side effect, namely addiction, is a cause for great concern in pain treatment using opioids. Prescription opioids can be highly addictive and are widely misused. It has been estimated that the total economic cost of opioid misuse in the United States is $78.5 billion per year. The opioid crisis has been exacerbated by over-prescription of opioid pain-relievers for the treatment of pain. Due at least in part due to over-prescription and additive nature of opioids, some who experience chronic pain may suffer undertreatment. In fact, in many parts of the developing world, access to opioids even for acute pain and/or cancer pain can be restricted due to concerns over addiction and overdose. Even in the United States, some patients can suffer from an undertreatment of pain. For example, patients with cognitive impairment and the elderly can be especially susceptible to the central nervous system effects of traditional opioids such as morphine and in some cases are not prescribed enough to meet their pain management needs.",

    "ip_number": "UA22-115",
    "published_date": "2/15/2022",
    "ip_description": "This technology is a system to create a shock impulse on the ground. It operates through a gear-motor that rotates a crank which lifts a linear slider. The slider is mounted in a massive body hammer that compresses a concentric spring on the slider shaft when the gear-motor rotates the crank. This causes the crank to rotate freely and the hammer to drop, creating a shock impulse into a strike plate. The use of a one-way bearing prevents any kind of bounce back and chatter in the impulse signal. This proposed technology fills the need to create an active seismic source on interplanetary landing spacecraft for the characterization of lunar and planetary geology. Natural seismic events are unpredictable both in terms of timing and content. Thus, an artificial signal created on demand and with a known seismic signal content is strongly desired. However, many terrestrial analogs require ordnance or are very heavy and require large power draw. This technology features a compact, lightweight design that relies on low power consumption, which as a result is much more desirable for spacecraft which have extremely limited resources for mass and energy. The global space economy is expected to grow by more than $700 billion in the next 20 years, and with new technologies come more possibilities. Spacecraft are projected to see a CAGR greater than 8%.

Moreover, the capacity of the proposed EA scheme is significantly higher than EA repetition-BPSK, homodyne, heterodyne, and Holevo capacities. Finally, the proposed EA scheme outperforms the corresponding EA scheme with OPC placed on a receiver side. The problem with quantum entanglement devices is that they are easily electromagnetically (meaning light, magnetism, etc) interfered with. It is particularly difficult for the transmitter (the sender of the signal) to send information to the receiver. This tech solves the problem using Optical Phase Conjugation: process where an incoming electromagnetic wave is reflected with a reversed phase, so called \u201ctime-reversal of electromagnetic waves,\u201d allows cancellation of spatial distortion introduced into the incoming beam.

According to the CDC, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States: about one in every four deaths is due to heart disease. Some heart conditions can be treated through replacement of heart valves. However, existing replacement heart valves have limitations. Tissue-based replacement valves, which are taken from other humans or animals, tend not to last long, often requiring another replacement later in life. Mechanical valves, on the other hand, last a long time, but they tend to cause blood clots, so recipients of mechanical replacement valves need to take anticoagulant medicine for the rest of their lives. In recent years, there has been increasing research into the use of synthetic polymers to create heart valves. Many hope that polymeric valves will offer longer life than tissue valves, while reducing the clotting risk experienced with mechanical valves.

This ubiquitous but relatively inert bond, if converted to more valuable C-C bond, can greatly accelerate the construction of a wide variety of compounds. This transformation is particularly sought after in fine chemicals and pharmaceutical applications. Incorporation of an aryl substituents at the \u03b1-position of carbonyl compounds is a powerful and attractive method to construct a C(sp2)-C(sp3) bond; and its coupling products, especially \u03b1-aryl cyclic ketones are significant structural motifs that are often encountered in a wide range of biologically interesting natural and pharmaceutical products.

    "ip_description": "This invention describes a novel therapeutic approach to treat cardiac muscle arrhythmias and skeletal muscle tremors. Cardiac arrhythmias, such as those that cause atrial fibrillation or sudden cardiac death (SCD), are typically viewed as electrical/conduction abnormalities that drive uncoordinated heartbeats and their downstream health effects. Accordingly, most antiarrhythmic drugs are ion channel blockers that alter electrical conduction or cell calcium signaling pathways. These drugs alter electrical conduction or cell calcium signaling pathways by affecting so called \"excitation-contraction\" coupling where electrical/chemical signaling occurs upstream of, and thus prior to, muscle contraction. The inventors have proposed a novel therapeutic that works downstream of these conventional drug targets: treating cardiac and skeletal contractile units, known as sarcomeres, with myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C). Here, they assert that this approach can modulate intrinsic wavelike oscillations of the sarcomeres, and would therefore be a novel antiarrhythmic and antitremor therapeutic approach. This is based on discoveries that have shifted the notion that cardiac arrhythmias and skeletal muscle tremors nearly always result from dysfunction of the upstream electrical/chemical signaling. Applications: Novel therapeutic for cardiac arrhythmias and skeletal muscle tremors. Advantages: May be more effective for those who have not responded to current/conventional treatments; May be more effective in broadly treating these cardiac dysfunctions.",

Iron is an important element that is necessary for many critical processes in biological systems, including both eukaryotic cells and bacteria. Iron chelators act by binding iron, making it easier for cells and tissues to move and excrete. Combining 3HAA with an iron supplement or an iron chelator creates the dual benefit of killing and inhibiting growth of pathogenic bacteria while repressing hyperinflammatory response. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States alone sees more than 2.8 million cases of antibiotic-resistant infection each year resulting in more than 35,000 deaths. Sepsis, a dysfunctional systemic inflammatory response to infection leading to organ damage and failure, is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) and among the most expensive health conditions treated in the United States. Sepsis survivors experience chronic inflammation, immune suppression, reduced physical function, elevated frailty, and higher mortality rates. The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance has left healthcare workers with a depleted toolbox to combat sepsis. Age is both a primary risk factor for developing sepsis and a major determinant of survival and long-term consequences. There is an urgent and growing need to identify novel antibiotics to combat both the general expansion of antibiotic-resistance bacterial pathogens and sepsis-particularly in elderly patients. To solve this problem, there is a need to develop new types of bacteria-resistant antibiotics.

The method may be used to create compounds with multiple, specific chiral centers. Rhamnolipids are a type of chemical notable particularly for their surfactant properties. Unlike most traditional surfactants (such as soaps and detergents), rhamnolipids can be created through an environmentally friendly process, and the resultant chemical is generally less harmful than traditional surfactants. This technology enables production of one specific enantiomer of a given rhamnolipid. Enantiomers have the same chemical formula, but are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, much like a person\u2019s left and right hands. It is valuable to be able to produce specific enantiomers because, despite having the same chemical formula, two enantiomers can have different effects on living organisms.

It is ideal for use with heliostats that can have their shape actively changed to maximize their light concentration effectiveness as they track the sun over the course of the day. Heliostats are devices that track the sun over the course of a day, reflecting the sunlight to a stationary target. Large arrays of heliostats, or \u201cheliostat fields,\u201d can be used to concentrate and focus light on one location such as a spot at the top of a tower. The heat generated from the concentrated light can then be used to generate power or provide a heat source for industrial operations without generating a carbon footprint. Heliostats require calibration to ensure they are reflecting and concentrating light as efficiently as possible.

    "published_date": "8/24/2023",
    "ip_description": "The technology involves the design of a hybrid tilt propeller / tilt wing aircraft augmented with Active Flow Control (AFC). This proposed design enhances the aircraft's cruise efficiency and reduces high-power consumption during takeoff, without compromising on hover, vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), and super-short takeoff and landing (SSTOL) capabilities. The control of pitch in hover using an active tail and the tilt wing augmented by AFC not only reduces the power needed for zero run takeoff or landing but it allows the elimination of the cyclic and the edge flight transition to cruise.\n\nThe big advantage of airplanes capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) is that they do not need a runway. Since the tilt rotor concept such as the V-22 evolved from a helicopter that is also used for search and rescue missions, long duration hover is a requirement. However, the thrust needed to hover is an order of magnitude larger than the thrust used by airplanes during cruise, thus a large penalty is paid by requiring an airplane to do both. A tilt-rotor aircraft has a short range and takes relatively small payloads due to download (i.e. the force generated by flow from the rotors that impinge on the upper surface of the wing during hover) take-off (download), and due to its stubby wings (i.e. the low wing span is necessitated in hover when the entire weight of the plane is carried by the rotor shafts). It is also expensive to run because it uses the cyclic capability of the rotor for stability and control during hover and the edge-flow transition to airplane mode.\n\nA hybrid tilt-wing/tilt-rotor airplane concept that is aided by active flow control, can take-off without a runway and climb at very steep angles. It may transport heavy loads or large number of passengers very effectively and cheaply. Its download is reduced by partial tilt and active flow control. Its wingspan is increased by adding an outboard tilted wing, and most importantly, an active gimbled tail that is effective in hover and low forward speeds can eliminate the need for the cyclic motion thus reduce the cost and complexity of operation.\n\nApplications:\n*   Military aircrafts\n*   Civilian aircrafts\n*   Transportation\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Reduces power requirements of takeoff\n*   High cruising speed capabilities\n*   Ability to climb very steep angles\n*   More efficient\n*   Reduces cost\n*   Reduces complexity of operation",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a technique to improve the accuracy and performance of autonomous planetary landing vehicles. Measurements from a stabilized seeker implementing a sensor capable of range and closing speed measurements is used to construct a velocity field that, when tracked in six degrees of freedom, will bring the lander to a pinpoint soft landing at the designated landing site, at an upright attitude with negligible rotational velocity. This site can either be illuminated by an optical beacon, or can be selected using terrain hazard avoidance software operating on suitable measurements. A possible hardware configuration for a landing site identified by a landing beacon is a Doppler LIDAR rangefinder with boresight axis aligned with a camera\u2019s optical axis. A possible implementation using software to identify a safe landing site would be a flash LIDAR unit, either fixed in the body frame or gimbaled, where appropriate software would use the flash LIDAR image to select a safe landing site. One aspect of the invention is implementing the guidance and control system using deep reinforcement learning. This method supports multiple divert maneuvers during the descent phase, often required when the classification of a landing site as safe or unsafe changes during the descent as the flash LIDAR resolution increases. Another aspect of the invention is the periodic adjustment of the seeker platform attitude during the descent to keep the landing site centered in the seeker field of view. Technical developments have progressively enabled the increased use of automated landers for use in scientific and exploratory missions to the moon and other planets. Furthermore, the US is planning a human return to the surface of the moon in the coming years. One challenge in descent to the surface of a planet is the reliable and resource-efficient landing in a safe area during descent.

    "ip_description": "This technology is a method of compensating for both look angle dependent radome refraction and rate gyro scale factor errors using deep learning technology, significantly improving the accuracy and effectiveness of a guidance and control system. Look angle dependent radome refraction (which can be modeled as a time varying scale factor error applied to the line of sight direction vector) can create a false indication of target motion, potentially destabilizing a guidance and control system. Similarly, rate gyro scale factor errors create a time-varying bias in the integrated rotational velocity, which is used to estimate the change in vehicle attitude over the trajectory. When this biased change in attitude is then used to stabilize a seeker platform, either computationally in the case of strap down seekers or mechanically in the case of gimballed seekers, imperfect stabilization occurs, again leading to a false indication of target motion. Prior art to compensate for these errors typically estimates the scale factors using a bank of Kalman filters using adaptive models. However, since these models typically adapt only parameters in the ordinary differential equations describing the equations of motion, performance suffers when the structure of the model differs from the actual deployment environment. In contrast, our approach can learn a more expressive representation of the dynamics, and quickly adapt to the actual deployment environment. This technology is a novel method for adaptively correcting sensor scale factor errors using deep learning techniques to predict both the rotational velocity and line of sight scale factor errors, and compensate for these errors using the predictions, improving the performance of a guidance and control system.",

According to NASA, there are approximately 23,000 pieces of space junk larger than a softball orbiting Earth, and there are over 100 million pieces a millimeter or larger. These pieces of junk are moving at high speed and can severely damage a satellite or spacecraft they hit. A collision can even cause more debris to form, worsening the problem; in 2009, a defunct spacecraft collided with another craft, resulting in 2,300 new pieces of debris.

This method can detect samples of SARS-CoV-2 in saline gargle solutions down to 10 ag/\u03bcl (below single copy level). A saline sample is collected, loaded onto a paper-based microfluidic chip, and analyzed using a smartphone-based fluorescence microscope. The method uses lower-cost materials to detect virus samples in a saline solution and is more sensitive that similar rapid kits. The sample-to-answer assay time is less than 20 minutes. The method also has high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, hitting 100%, 88%, and 93% respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed society\u2019s need for rapid, low cost, highly sensitive diagnostic tests. Many tests have been developed throughout the pandemic but many of them require expensive laboratory equipment and may have long processing times, especially in high case volume periods. Additionally, many of the point-of-care tests are inexpensive and user friendly, but they often have inferior sensitivity. Many of these existing methods also require uncomfortable nasal swabs, which may expose healthcare staff to the virus. This testing method resolves these problems by using a saline gargle solution and a smartphone fluorescence microscope. The saline gargle samples are easy to collect and are easily obtained from patients and pose less risk to healthcare staff during sample collection. The smartphone fluorescence microscope is also more readily available than most lab testing equipment.

The infected droplets are collected on a paper microfluidic chip, which then has antibody-conjugated submicron fluorescent particle suspension added, with the antibody binding to the SARS antigens and aggregation. A smartphone-based fluorescent microscope is then used to quantify the extent of the particle aggregation to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2. This method can be applied to other airborne viruses.\n\nThe novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19, became a global pandemic in early March of 2020. Since then, the virus has infected more than 180 million people worldwide and has killed nearly 4 million. Although there are now vaccines to inoculate against the virus, only 23.2% of the world population has received a vaccine, and the vaccine is not 100% effective in protecting against the disease. Therefore, it remains imperative to be able to rapidly detect the virus when someone becomes infected, so that they can seek medical treatment and avoid spreading it to others.\n\nWhile many COVID-19 diagnostics exist, many are unreliable or take many days to receive results. Furthermore, most COVID-19 tests cause discomfort for the individual being tested, deterring some from receiving the test. This technology instead can detect SARS-CoV-2 through small saliva droplets from an infected individual using a small microfluidic chip and a smartphone-based fluorescence microscope technology.

The method here exploits the non-linearity of the quantum computing systems to create logical phibits. The number of phibits is not constrained by the domains of the physical state and the approach here also allows for the definition of the space of states which lie the elastic states of multi phibit systems. Because of the lack of physical constraints, the size of space of states is 2^N where N is the number of phibits, which corresponds to an exponential scaling. This level of exponential scaling is vital to the implementation of quantum computing style algorithms. Quantum computing is a growing field due to the potential for quantum computers to solve complex computations substantially faster than a regular computer. The field is also increasingly relevant as it shifts towards real world use due to applications in the pharmaceutical industry and around data security, among other uses. A major hurdle in the use of quantum computing is the expensive requirements of use. Along with physical obstacles such as the ultralow temperature quantum computers run at, they are often not scalable due to physical limitations which do not allow for an increase of qubits. The invention here is a method that will allowed for a scalable multi phi-bit system, which will allow users to avoid many of the expensive requirements of quantum computing systems. By taking advantage of phi-bits, which is a two-level classical analogue of the qubit, the method here is not constrained by physical limitations on the number of phi-bits as the phi-bits are differentiated in the spectral domain.

The technique works by using a shutter or chopper to periodically block one of the exposing beams during the fabrication and measuring the power of the diffracted beam using a power meter. This technique has the potential for a higher accuracy calculation of the diffraction efficiency of VHOEs at a greater simplicity. Volume Holographic Elements (VHOEs) have many applications ranging from display systems, medical devices, and solar energy systems. An important characteristic of VHOEs is diffraction efficiency, which measures how much power is diffracted into a designated direction compared to the power incident onto the diffractive element. Most VHOEs must attain a certain diffraction efficiency; in many designs, the diffraction efficiency should be maximized while in others, the diffraction efficiency is intentionally a lower value. The most common method of controlling the diffraction efficiency is to characterize the holographic material\u2019s diffraction efficiency as a function of exposure energy by fabricating a set of holograms with different exposure energies and measuring the diffraction efficiency of each, with the hologram most closely matching the design constraint used to fabricate the desired VHOE. Another method uses additional equipment and complicated experimental setups to measure the diffraction efficiency by shining light from a separate laser at the construction wavelength from the VHOE. This technique, which works by using a shutter or chopper to periodically block one of the exposing beams during the fabrication and measuring the power of the diffracted beam using a power meter, can calculate the diffraction efficiency at a higher accuracy at a greater simplicity. The calculations are performed in real time, meaning the technique has the potential to account for local variations in the material or laser power that causes the necessary exposure time to fluctuate between samples, which allows for a more precise reading of the diffraction efficiency.

Various analogues within this class of chemistry can be tuned to the redox potential for selective targeting of cancer cell types. Following cellular uptake, the tetrazolium compounds of the present invention undergo reduction to produce metal-binding formazan species that are capable of in vivo binding of various metals. In this approach, the prochelator compound forms an active metal-binding chelator under specific conditions in order to minimize indiscriminate depletion of essential metal ions and potential side effects. The resulting formazan compounds are stable in blood serum and present antiproliferative activities in the 10-30 \u00b5M range, as confirmed against a panel of various cancer cell lines. Iron is an essential element and is the most abundant transition metal in humans. The normal functions of human cells rely on iron due to its vital role in oxygen transport, energy generation, and DNA synthesis. Altered metabolism and homeostasis of transition metal ions (such as iron, copper, and zinc) are associated with several pathological conditions including cancer and neurodegeneration. Thus, metal-binding compounds (chelators) may play important roles in these pathways and may be potential drug candidates for these pathological conditions. Malignant cells have a higher demand for iron to sustain their rapid proliferation rates. As a result, targeting iron metabolism in cancer cells has become a promising strategy in cancer therapy. Iron chelation therapy is a treatment that removes iron in the organism by utilizing a small-molecule scavenger (chelator). This invention uses tetrazolium salts as pro-chelators, namely precursors to iron chelators that can limit intracellular iron availability and cause cell death. The invention relates to methods of making the tetrazolium salts and methods of treatment using the compounds. A prochelation strategy uses disulfide switches to mask the tridentate binding unit of thiosemicarbazone and aroylhydrazone chelators. Upon cellular uptake, the reduction of the disulfide bond releases a thiolate chelator that coordinates iron with high affinity in mammalian cells. The treatment involves a prodrug strategy in which the pro-chelator forms accumulate in cancer cells and transform into the iron-binding chelator forms. Preliminary results have shown moderate anti-proliferative activity in two cancer cell lines.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a new ultra-sensitive torsion balance device small enough to fit on a microchip which can be used to measure forces, gravity or acceleration with a high degree of resolution. A torsion balance measures torque by monitoring the rotation of a test mass suspended from an elastic fiber acting as a torsion spring. To increase the sensitivity of the balance, the size of the fiber can be reduced, resulting in a smaller torsional stiffness and, therefore, larger rotation. This technology merges the concepts behind the original torsion balance with modern-day technology to create a small and ultra-sensitive device for measuring forces and changes in gravity. One of the key insights is that model nanofabrication techniques can be used to dramatically reduce the size of the torsion fiber, yielding higher sensitivity and, at the same time, a smaller form factor.

    "ip_description": "This technology is a device that facilitates accurate and precise volume measurements of solid objects. Originally created for the purpose of measuring the total volume of a sample of plant matter, it is ideal for measuring the volume of any solid material with complex shapes or many holes and gaps. In agriculture, it is valuable to have methods of measuring the yield of crops in a reliable and repeatable way; this can facilitate precision agriculture practices, where the ideal distribution of nutrients or irrigation are used to maximize crop yields. However, to reliably maximize production, there needs to be a means of accurately and precisely measuring the crop yields. There are many remote sensing technologies being investigated for solving these problems (such as drone, camera, and satellite monitoring, 3D scanning, and soil sensors). However, many of these solutions either offer only a coarse approximation of volume measurement of a plant due to to the complex shape and open gaps in the plants. This technology offers a simple, inexpensive, and high-fidelity means of measuring the true volume of plant matter, that can be used either on its own or to validate alternative means of volume measurement. Because it can accommodate many types of solid objects beyond just plant material, it has the potential for use anywhere there is a need for high-precision and high-accuracy measurements of the volume of objects with complex shapes. Applications include crop management / yield measurement, laboratory volumetric measurement, and any applications needing precise and accurate measurement of objects with complex shapes.

MMP-12 is a protein biomarker associated with neurological inflammatory diseases and has been found here to be correlated to chronic inflammation in the brain following stroke. Therapeutic efficacy may also be assessed using MMP-12 assays.\n\nAccording to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke every year.

    "ip_description": "University of Arizona researchers have discovered a novel approach for treating fungal or yeast infections using a previously unstudied GPCR-like protein, which is integral to the regulation of cell growth in yeast cells. This protein and metabolic pathway is absent in higher-order animals, which provides a novel pathway for drugs to stop the growth of deadly fungal pathogens, such as drug resistant Candida glabrata. This technology may also provide a route to improved control of yeast growth in manufacturing. This invention builds on a previous UArizona discovery of a novel cell signaling pathway/mechanism regulating cell growth and metabolism via TORC1, that is present in simple eukaryotes, such as fungi, yeast, and some parasites, but is not present in higher-order animals. To function correctly, cells set their growth rate based on a wide array of factors, such as nutrient, stress, and hormone signals. In eukaryotes, this fine-tuned control depends, in a large part, on a single, highly-conserved, signaling hub called the Target of Rapamycin kinase Complex I (TORC1). In the presence of pro-growth hormones and abundant nutrients, TORC1 drives growth by activating protein, ribosome, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis. In contrast, when nutrient or hormone levels drop, TORC1 is repressed, causing cells to switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism, and eventually enter a quiescent state. Applications include a solution to address drug resistant fungal infections, treatment to slow or stop the growth of fungal infections, and control the growth/metabolism of yeast in an industrial setting. Advantages include a selective mode of action for controlling yeast or fungal growth and a novel approach to address drug resistant fungal infection.",

This ion flotation technique is a simple, cost-effective, green method to extract rare earth elements from aqueous solutions in an effort to keep the public and environment safe and compliant with EPA standards. In the western half of the United States especially, there are approximately 4,200 legacy mining sites that have been used in the past to mine for uranium. However, between 1980 and 2000 the price for uranium dropped and many of these mining sites were left abandoned. Many of these abandoned mines were left with unlined leach pads and much of the uranium seeped back into the groundwater. The issue now is not only compliance with EPA standards and regulations, but the health of the public who interact daily with groundwater in those areas. Currently, there are many techniques for removing uranium from aqueous solutions including, but not limited to, membrane filtration methods, anion exchange, or the application of coagulation processes. The important questions asked when addressing the many different techniques are questions of scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness. This ion flotation technology checks all three boxes in a way that would potentially allow communities and industrial waste sites to use a simple, inexpensive technique for uranium removal from aqueous solutions.

Not only do blue light suppressing glasses decrease some of the stress on an individuals\u2019 eyes, but the decrease in blue light staves off another side effect of blue light consumption: a decrease in melatonin production.

This technology provides a means of delivery of GI therapies for a number of indications without requiring metabolism through the liver or other systemic exposure.\n\nAs one example of GI disease, colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. Patients with colorectal cancer often receive chemotherapy as a primary treatment or as a pre/post-surgery treatment for their cancer. One of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of colorectal cancer is 5-Fluorouracil. 5-Fluorouracil is used due to its high effectiveness rates against colorectal cancer. Current oral administrations of pro-drugs for 5-Fluorouracil, capecitabine and tegafur, must be metabolized in the liver before 5-FU can be released, thus, the drug is not concentrated in the colon, but rather is systematically available.

The separation media comprises a selective surface modifier, with tunable properties, incorporated on an inexpensive material, which may be a cellulose sponge, fiber, or powder. \n\nBackground:  Perfluorinated organics are very stable manmade chemicals that have properties that allow them to repel both water and oil. PFAS are often referred to as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not readily breakdown in the environment and are water soluble. PFAS have been found to accumulate into bodies of humans and animals. Scientists are still learning about the health effects of exposures to PFAS. PFAS are very expensive to remove from water supplies or aquifers with conventional water treatment due to their low concentrations in water and their high hydrophilicity. Current treatment programs typically use a process of one-pass loading and then disposal of granulated activated carbon while separation processes (absorption, ion exchange, or membranes) continue to be developed to meet the challenge of cost-effective and environmentally sound clean-up of environmental contamination.\n\nApplications:\n*   Water treatment\n*   Environmental clean-up\n*   Simple point-of-use application\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Ease of use\n*   Inexpensive\n*   Re-usable sorbent\n*   Sorbent tunable properties\n*   Low pressure drop\n*   Potential for no or little additional fluid generated for backflushing",

    "ip_description": "Entanglement Assisted Communication (EACOMM) and quantum computing is the future for many different industries. The unique capabilities of being able to calculate some superposition of atoms between 0 and 1 is a huge asset for complex computing. While the channel capacity for EACOMM has been theoretically demonstrated, optimal quantum receivers have yet to be determined. In order to realize the optimal efficiency and capability of EACOMM, quantum receivers must advance in tandem with the other hardware involved in EACOMM. This technology is a step in realizing the capability of EACOMM and does so with a lower-cost solution. The technology involves the use of several low-complexity quantum receivers employing the optical parametric amplifier as a basic building block. Entanglement Assisted Communications (EACOMM) relies on quantum entanglement which is the heart of quantum physics. EACOMM takes advantage of the fact that quantum physics laws describes how atoms are able to take on some superposition between 0 and 1 instead of the simple binary in communication over the internet today. This principle of superposition allows for the performance of far more complex calculations which is extremely useful in many different areas. The superposition allows for secure transfer of information through quantum key distribution (QKD). Because each particle is some fraction between 0 and 1, two communication systems are able to send information through fiber optic cables and through a process known as key sifting, ensure that they have the same key. This process makes the transmission of information practically impossible to hack. All of these stand as theoretical capabilities of EACOMM and are beginning to become reality with several EACOMM applications beginning to unfold in real-time. However, the hardware needs to continually improve in order to achieve the theoretical capabilities of the theoretical channel capacity of this technology. These new quantum receivers enhance the actual capabilities of quantum communications.",

The documentary describes methods of jaguar detection motion cameras, scat sampling, and hair sampling. The camera tracking method for jaguars and ocelots uses cameras deployed at 140 sites over 16 mountain ranges, and the success of this method makes it a model for other research programs tracking large mammals. Given the large number of cameras and large detection area, collaboration with local residents and multiple government agencies is vital. This documentary serves to educate both the general public and residents with affected land about the program, its impact, and its importance. In Southern Arizona over the last 15 years, solitary male jaguars\u2014typically one at any given time\u2014have migrated from Northern Mexico into Southern Arizona and New Mexico. Controversial lawsuits and federal actions for habitat designation for this endangered species has raised concerns in the ranching community that operates on\u2014and in some cases owns\u2014the land within these boundaries. Although habitat designation fuels the perception that the ranching livelihood is under threat, it\u2019s unlikely that the designation in itself will have any impact on the ranching operations within jaguar critical habitat. Instead, the protection of these large, unfragmented open spaces is mutually critical for both the jaguar and the ranchers. The National Park Service describes different wildlife monitoring programs, such as at Point Reyes National Seashore. In Canada, wildlife sensor and alert systems have been set up to reduce the number of collisions with large animals such as moose.

The enzyme was engineered to target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and become expressed using an embryo-specific promoter in the transgenic maize. It can be used in combination with an RNAi suppression method, HIGS, to protect maize during pre-harvest conditions. It is estimated that 25% of the world\u2019s crops are contaminated with a mycotoxin, a toxin produced by fungal sources. Aflatoxins are one class of mycotoxins that have two particularly toxic strains that are often found in maize, peanuts, cotton, and tree nuts. When ingested through the consumption of these crops, aflatoxin has been shown to be a Group 1 carcinogen for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer. HCC is the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Many countries restrict the levels of aflatoxins allowed in food, which results in millions of crops being disposed of each year. Most prior methods to reduce the prevalence of aflatoxins in crops have been insufficient and still result in the loss of many crops. Because aflatoxin contaminates crops in both pre-harvest and post-harvest storage, it is essential to have a method that is capable of working under both conditions.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a novel method to the improvement of nano-fiber scaffolding. The cells that make up every human, or any organism for that matter, are held together largely depending on the extra-cellular matrices within different tissues (bone, skin, tendons, blood vessels etc.). These matrices help to keep the cells in place and provide a structure upon which cells are able to proliferate and adhere correctly. Electrospinning has proven to be a way to recreate scaffolding using micro and nano fibers that also allow cells to adhere and propagate.\n\nThis invention and advancement of the current technology is different 2D scaffolding topographies and the effect that topography has on cellular adhesion. It was found that the topographies play a significant role specifically influencing the number of cells adhering to the 2D structure over a 24 hour period. This discovery and method can focus the direction of research and understanding to create the optimal topography for wound healing and other tissue engineering applications.\n\nTissue replacement and repair are some of the important goals of tissue engineering. Much like any other form of rebuilding, scaffolding needs to be built to support the proliferation and adhesion of cells and, in this case, smooth muscle cells. Electrospinning is a widely recognized process for the replication of tissue matrix composition, topography, and other mechanical properties of natural tissue stroma. The process of electrospinning can be done with biologic or synthetic materials with the purpose of the electrospun scaffolds to provide a base for cellular adhesion which could facilitate faster wound healing.\n\nThis study focused on differences in cellular adhesion and retention in different topographies generated on a 2D plate. To what degree does the topography affect how cells interact with the scaffolding? That question may lead to important considerations for large-scale applications where the considerations of quick proliferation and widespread cell adhesion would directly affect the recovery of a medical procedure.",

    "ip_description": "There are two cysteine proteases that are encoded by SARS-CoV-2, the main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). Both of these proteases have been shown to be essential in viral replication and are validated antiviral drug targets. PLpro cleaves the viral SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein at three sites. In addition, it modulates host immune response by cleaving the ubiquitin and ISG modifications from host proteins. This technology identified several novel compounds that are effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Because of its role in viral replication and immune modulating, inhibition of PLpro is expected to provide therapeutic benefits in patients that are infected with SARS-CoV-2. As of February 1, 2021, there have been over 27 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States and nearly half a million deaths related to the virus. Worldwide there have been over 100 million cases of COVID-19, with over 2.2 million dead from the virus. The virus also has been damaging to the global economy as well as the U.S. economy. Despite the devastation caused by the virus, there are still very few FDA-approved treatments for those who become infected with the virus. In late 2020, two vaccines were approved for emergency use to be administered to prevent the disease; however, a very small percentage of individuals have been able to receive that vaccine. Therefore, it is essential that more treatment options become available for those that become ill with COVID-19. This technology introduces novel, highly-potent PLpro inhibitory compounds that will be able to be used to stop the viral replication of COVID-19. This can be used retroactively to slow the spread of the disease in individuals who have already become infected with COVID-19. PLpro inhibitors have also been shown to be useful antivirals for other human coronaviruses, giving this technology potential to be used to develop treatments for future infectious diseases that resemble COVID-19.",

The method of the invention is particularly useful in producing an alpha-aryl substituted cyclic ketone from an un-activated cyclic ketone compound. This is vast improvement to the synthesis of building blocks to many different fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. This allows companies to perform the alpha arylation at room temperature, in the absence of expensive and toxic metals, and with commonly available white or green light.\n\nThe development of practical methods for the arylation of carbonyl compounds is, and has long been, a challenge in organic synthesis. Typically, this has been done through catalysis using expensive metals, such as palladium, and with temperatures exceeding 130\u00b0C or 266\u00b0F. All of this contributes to the difficulty of manufacturing commercial important intermediates for fine chemicals or pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals especially face difficulty in manufacturing because of heavy regulation regarding the use of heavy metals in the manufacturing process.\n\nFor example, ketamine is one of the largest breakthroughs in severe depression in years when it was developed. Currently the process of synthesizing ketamine is an eight-step process that requires metal complexes and toxic reagents. With this synthesizing technique, Ketamine could be synthesized in four steps without any of the expensive metals or toxic reagents. Furthermore, the four steps now require much lower temperatures, around room temperature, and photosynthesizing agents instead of heavy metals.\n\nApplications:\n\n* Pharmaceutical chemical synthesis\n* Fine Chemicals production\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* Direct photoredox synthetic approach for alpha-carbonyl arylation from unactivated cyclic ketones\n* Photocatatalyst effective at room temperature under green light\n* Wide functional group tolerance\n* Inexpensive precursors\n* High yields\n* Fewer synthetic steps",

The optical system combines state-of-the-art optical lens technology with new corrective lenses that address shortcomings in the state-of-the-art optical systems. Telescopes in space that orbit earth are typically used for scientific research and surveillance purposes. The aperture size is a limiting factor in the effectiveness of a space telescope, especially when examining deep space for exoplanets or other celestial objects and phenomena. However, the larger and more massive the telescope is, the more expensive and difficult it becomes to successfully launch and deploy it. Recent developments in lens technologies have helped address the weight issue, enabling a new generation of much more powerful space telescopes. This technology builds on the advantages of state-of-the-art refractive and multi-order diffractive lens elements, and introduces novel corrective elements to produce an optical system with superior image quality while maintaining ultralightweight construction.

It can be used on its own or working together with existing streak reduction techniques, such as iterative reconstruction. Radial sampling (as opposed to Cartesian sampling) in MRI is particularly useful in reducing scan times and producing images resistant to artifacts caused by the subject\u2019s motion. This makes radial sampling particularly useful in abdominal imaging, where it is difficult to keep the abdomen still. However, streaking artifacts often result in these images, making the image difficult to read and could potentially result in misdiagnosis of a condition. Existing techniques to correct for the streaking have some success but are limited in their effectiveness. For example, one technique is to remove the samples causing the biggest streaks, but this can often result in degradation of the overall image quality, which still leads to difficulty reading the image. This technology, on the other hand, can reduce or eliminate streaks, while still preserving the quality of the underlying image. Applications: Radial MRI, Particularly useful in abdominal imaging. Advantages: Flexible; can be used as a preprocessing step or incorporated into iterative reconstructions, Superior performance over state of the art streak reduction techniques, No significant signal loss.",

The resulting high sulfur content polymers are referred to as Chalcogenide Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Polymers (CHIP) materials have improved polymer compatibility and efficient crosslinking. Furthermore, this technology suppresses \"reversion,\" the loss of rubber stiffness over time, which is an undesirable quality.\n\nVulcanization of rubber and other polymeric materials is a well-established method for enhancing physical properties by chemical crosslinking. Vulcanized materials are generally more thermally, chemically, and physically robust than their non-vulcanized analogs. These increased characteristics are attributed to the formation of carbon-sulfur bonds which allow for bridging of the polymer chains by varying numbers of sulfur atoms to form crosslinked networks. While accelerator additives are used to increase the speed of vulcanization, thus permitting polymerization at lower temperatures and greater efficiency, vulcanization still requires high temperatures and suffers from inefficient mixing of components due to poor incompatibility which results in incomplete curing and undesirable decomposition. Hence, there is a need for technology for improved polymer compatibility and lower-temperature curing.\n\nApplications:\n* Tire rubber vulcanization\n* Latex manufacturing\n* Suitable for natural, synthetic, or a combination of materials\n\nAdvantages:\n* Improved solubility in tire rubber precursors compared to elemental sulfur and improved crosslinking\n* \"Reversion\" suppression",

There is a body of research surrounding mammalian exposure to light pulses and the effects of those light pulses on the circadian rhythm. This technology is an addition to the body of research and shows the utility of intermittent light administration on the order of nanoseconds and microseconds rather than minutes or hours. The idea is to positively affect the circadian rhythm of an individual without consistent medication or extreme life changes. There are many diseases and mental health issues that can be affected by the shifting of the circadian rhythm and this technology is the first step in showing this can be an effective combatant of various disease states. The circadian system influences the date and time perceptions of the human body and, with that information, the human body responds accordingly. Understanding and influencing the circadian timing allows for simple things like improving moods to changing the health and well-being of an individual suffering from chronic ailments. Traditionally, circadian timing has been influenced with elongated exposure to bright synthetic light to perhaps shift the circadian system. While it has been established that elongated light stimulation can, and does, shift circadian timing, that elongated timeline is not efficient nor is it practical for many individuals wishing to influence their circadian system in hopes of positive effects. However, with the hopes that much faster exposures to light would allow the subject to feel the benefits of shifting their circadian timing, the very real possibility of affecting that shift with light begins to take shape.

    "ip_description": "Animal studies have always been a large part of scientific and medical discoveries both for the animals being studied and for eventual human application. Plethysmography, studying the changes in the volume of a body or organ, is a critical part of those studies. Here specifically is the study of respiration endpoints in mice and rats given different environmental conditions including the introduction of aerosolized medication. Typically, there are two ways mice and rats have been studied: conscious or unconscious. Administering anesthesia is tricky and it does not accurately reflect the conscious reactions sometimes sought after in the research. However, conscious plethysmography offers its own set of problems. Scientists are trying to record accurate data while simultaneously keeping the mice under as little stress possible. Typically, head-out chambers require restraints to keep the mice in place. There is a problem particularly with head-out plethysmographs in losing pressure from leaks in those restraints. This invention introduces an air-fillable balloon that tightens safely and securely around the rodent\u2019s neck. The balloon seals the container, preventing air leaks and maintaining accurate pressure in the plethysmography chamber ensuring thousands of accurate breath measurements. Conscious, restrained plethysmography during research on rodents can be difficult to achieve accurate results in terms of keeping accurate pressure, temperature, and humidity in the chamber or chambers. Much of that has to do with the restraint on the rodent\u2019s head. While most head-out chambers offer a few different sizes, each mouse head is shaped slightly differently which just means that there are some gaps for air to escape. This technology allows one to measure the respiratory rate, lung capacity, etc. for any sized rodent by sealing the chamber encapsulating the rodent\u2019s abdomen away from the rodent\u2019s head. This simple solution allows for more flexibility in experimental design, less stress on the rodent yielding more accurate results, and eliminating the need for additional sensors and cumbersome solutions to the pressure, temperature, and air leak.",

    "ip_description": "Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease (AHPND) also known as Early Mortality Syndrome (EMS) is one of the most devastating diseases for shrimp farming in the last decade. Since its discovery in 2009, AHPND caused $2.56 billion dollars worth of losses in Vietnam, $11.6 billion in Thailand, and significant losses worldwide as the disease increases its geographic reach. This technology is part of the solution to the AHPND problem plaguing the shrimp market. The idea is giving the shrimp an ability to defend against the disease by using a feed that includes a protein additive. This protein attaches to the toxin produced by bacteria causing AHPND, thus functionally blocking the toxins from affecting the shrimp. Demand for shrimp the world over has increased in recent years for a number of reasons. These include but are not limited to: An increase in the middle class income in developing countries, An increase in seafood consumption, The continuing ease with which products are shipped around the world. Because demand for shrimp has increased, the need for industrial shrimp farming has also increased to meet that demand. However, just like any other farming practice, the close proximity and intensive farming with high stocking density exacerbates disease problems that otherwise may not be found in nature. Those diseases are the number one challenge in the shrimp industry and account for billions of dollars worth of losses every year. Each pathogen requires three things: (1) a host; (2) an optimum environment (temperature, proximity etc.); and (3) pathogen present in the water or other organism. Usually, farmers try to disconnect the third prong from the other two. One of the best ways is to give the shrimp some kind of protection from specific pathogens or diseases. One major way to accomplish this is to provide shrimp, from the beginning, feed and feed additives that prevent the pathogen from finding a suitable host in the farm. This research produced the end product designed to provide that defense to shrimp from AHPND.",

Virus-specific antibody-conjugated fluorescent particles and a biological fluid sample (saliva, mouth gargle, etc.) from the patient are added onto a paper microfluidic chip, causing target antigens to flow through the chip and inducing particle to aggregate. The microfluidic chip is then analyzed using the smartphone-based fluorescence microscope, which can count the aggregated particles one-by-one and quantify the amount of virus in the sample with the extreme limit of detection, down to a single copy. This process occurs rapidly, within minutes, allowing the user to assess their treatment plan quickly after administration of the test. The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, became a global pandemic in early March 2020. Worldwide, the virus has since killed nearly 1.5 million people and infected 64 million more. One of the key aspects to controlling the spread of the virus is to detect it early through testing and tracing infected individuals. Currently, there are not many diagnostic tests for COVID-19 that rapidly give an individual result. The most commonly available test is an RT-PCR test, results of which usually are not available for a couple of days. Rapid antigen tests are also available, however, its limit of detection and accuracy are not as good as RT-PCR.

This algorithm was programmed and tested in calculations of hydrogen deuteride (HD) in a stationary magnetic field. The splitting of the HD singlet and triplet energy levels were studied. This advancement involves using explicitly correlated Gaussian functions with shifted centers to represent the wave function dependent on the spatial coordination of the electrons and the nuclei. The work involved high-accuracy calculations performed with the use of supercomputers. Computer simulation to rationalize and predict the behavior and course of atoms and molecules in chemical and materials systems has been of critical importance in the chemical and allied industries for several decades. The advent of supercomputers and parallel processing has opened the door further for accurate predictions of chemical behavior which could previously only been usefully interrogated with empirical methods. In the last decade, various research groups have developed algorithms for predicting the structure and behavior at the atomic and molecular level taking into account quantum effects of atomic systems and states of electrons.

    "ip_description": "This technology uses deep neural networks to examine the power states of a device performing cryptographic operations and determine the underlying encryption key with high accuracy across varying processor architectures. Embedded systems are among devices often the most vulnerable to attacks on their security. They are often used in public or in distributed environments where it becomes a challenge to prevent physical tampering. The Internet of Things has resulted in a dramatic increase in the prevalence embedded devices, many of which process sensitive information. And the rapid technological developments in the defense industry demand high levels of security for technologies used in the field. One type of security threat particularly important to embedded devices are side-channel attacks. Side-channel attacks use information about a system, such as power states, to infer other, more valuable information. While the concept of side channel attacks has existed since the turn of the millennium, recent developments in machine learning technology, as illustrated in a 2016 article, have dramatically improved the feasibility of such attacks. This technology builds upon breakthroughs in side channel attack technology to create an attack method that can be used against devices with varying processor architectures, without significantly sacrificing accuracy. Other side channel attack methods include waveform matching with Fourier analysis to improve correlation accuracy of power states and keys, targeting processor branch instructions, measuring keyboard acoustics for password detection, and measuring interrupt latency for coarse-grained information in even the most secure Intel commodity processors. In addition to its potential offensive applications such as cyber warfare, it provides a valuable method of testing and verifying the security of embedded systems and their resistance to side channel attacks. For example, a research group detected cache-based side-channel attacks through identifying abnormal cache behaviors associated with those attacks. Side channel attack patents filed in the US in the past 5 years tend to concern defensive mechanisms to attacks (i.e. Intent patent US20190042479 A1 filed in 2018).",

The increased ability of people to travel all over the United States and the world is a trend that continues to rise. While hotels provide a number of amenities for guest comfort (i.e. WIFI, flat screens, entertainment etc.) is there a way to understand how well guests sleep in a given hotel? All of the other comforts are important, but customers are usually there to sleep. Is there a way to accurately track the sleep quality of a given hotel\u2019s guests? This study is the first step to establishing a uniform standard for tracking sleep satisfaction and how sleep quality affects the overall customer satisfaction in a given hotel. This research offers a unique perspective to the existing literature because it shows a strong correlation between the rating of a good night\u2019s sleep and the overall hotel experience. A number of factors contribute to the correlation. The research provides an incentive perspective for hotels because often it seems that the rate of return on increasing mattress quality, for example, is very low. However, this study would suggest that specifically modifying a few variables will allow an increase in overall hotel satisfaction without needlessly spending money. As established earlier, people travel more both for business and pleasure. And, in an era of online reviews, consumer sleep quality could be a million-dollar question for hotel owners. An easy way to increase satisfaction is to lower cost, increase room size, upgrade the mattress quality etc., but this is a business. Hotels, like any other industry are looking for the best possible return on investment. Many websites and apps like Yelp, review hotels and allow consumers to do the same. But these ratings are somewhat arbitrary to hotel administrators. What is it that makes the overall satisfaction three stars instead of five?

    "ip_description": "A lack of information is perhaps the crux of every problem involving public policy. In 2020, COVID-19 emphasizes the lack of data and information with which public figures attempt to make decisions. Ideally, public policy, including policy for large institutions, would be made with a crystal ball and 100% certainty of the effects of the policy. Because this is impossible, simulations try to iterate and propagate key assumptions over time. This invention provides policy makers a novel simulation based on a student-mobility model and a disease propagation in tandem. Student mobility meaning a GIS map overlaid with daily student schedules including classrooms, buildings, dorms, and so on, while the disease propagation model shows student health, shedding rate of the disease, number of infected students in various locations, probabilities of disease transmissions (airborne, droplet, etc.). The invention will allow administrators to get some insight into the impact of policy decisions. Computer models are used in applications like tensile-strength modeling of a steel beam to fluid modeling of biohazardous material in a given scenario. All of these computer models are run for the same reason: it is too expensive to run the experiment physically. This is true for COVID-19 and other diseases; the human cost and organizational cost is too expensive. It is imperative that administrators and policy makers are not ignorant to the effects of their policy decisions, nor should they be paralyzed because the effects of that paralysis may be equally deadly. Accurate models give those policy makers a reasonable glimpse of potential policy outcomes. There is a large need for these models in many areas and, in 2020, this could be the difference between locking down forever and changing input parameters to get people back where they need to be. While there are many models considering crowd control or disease transmission, this model integrates all of the data available to the university to provide a holistic presentation of campus reactions to policy changes.",

However, specialized equipment is expensive and unrealistic for family practices to carry. This invention is a low-cost, high-quality solution to the general problem. It allows general practitioners to analyze questionable skin areas to check for abnormalities, discoloration, lack of cell-uniformity, etc. Furthermore, the accessibility of the technology could expand to encompass the general public. This technology is an inexpensive, effective dermascope attachment to the smartphone that allows the user to map out dermal lesions using polarized white light imaging (PWLI) and polarized multispectral imaging (PMSI).

This invention provides people the information they need to reduce their stress as they re-enter. This is done by providing near real-time and real place information about factors that increase different types of perceived risks (e.g. potential for violence, PP usage, crowding, pinch-points, building occupancy and ventilation), mapping out potential areas of risk, and providing users potential routes around those areas. This information and dashboard can be applied to many campus-like settings, such as university campuses, shopping malls, office and industrial parks. The dashboard provides real time feedback to users. The feedback uses survey results for areas where people aren\u2019t following virus mitigation techniques, building facilities information like percent maximum occupancy, ventilation and humidity, and movement data. The dashboard serves as an information hub for risk assessment and mitigation for campuses at large. Furthermore, this dashboard would provide information for individuals to assess their own risk. Post-COVID, the dashboard can be used to overlay positive emotions on real places, to identify areas of comfort and wellbeing, and provide building owners and operators, and organizations feedback regarding occupant experience, thus identifying environment features that enhance their occupants\u2019 health and wellbeing. Lack of information about safety risks and comfort of places causes stress and anxiety for those entering those spaces, especially in the context of viral risk. Public and private policies for large groups of people are created, in large part, based on the idea of risk and reward. The multi-variable analysis required for assessing risk lacks the necessary variables. For example, number of people in certain locations, ventilation in specific buildings, number of people social distancing or wearing masks, etc. And, even if that information is collectible, there is a large time gap between collecting the information and assessing the information. This is a solution to the real time information gap. Real time risk assessment for those who make policy and for those who are on campus weighing their own risk and reward.

This technology can rival pupillometry in understanding physiological responses under various stresses and circumstances. This is a real-time, non-invasive way to detect sweat pores\u2019 response to stimuli, both physical and emotional. In society today, mental health is acknowledged perhaps more than any other time, as universally important to an individual\u2019s health. Physiological markers accompany certain disorders, for example PTSD, but those markers are difficult to measure or evaluate. This technology can improve how professionals evaluate some of those physiological markers. The American Psychiatric Association claim that 3.5% of American adults suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), but only 11 people are diagnosed. As a society, we are understanding the effects of mental health problems on concrete physiological responses to the human body. The novel steps in this technology allow for a new way to evaluate stressors like PTSD in, for example, candidates for positions where understanding of one\u2019s mental or emotional stressors are required. Furthermore, in the realm of professional and amateur athletics, athletes would have the ability to test their response to emotional and physical stressors and adjust accordingly. While other methods of evaluating the Automatic Nervous System (ANS) exist, they can be difficult to operationalize and often require wearing multiple sensors and complicated equipment. This method frees the individual from those inconveniences, allows the user or researcher to test a wide variety of situations, and does so in a non-invasive manner. Aside from improving athletic performance and screening for appropriate candidates, there is a growing market for diagnosing and treating mental health disorders. This study explored the possibility of identifying physical markers, such as sweat gland response, to physical and emotional stimuli to perhaps indicate triggers for PTSD. There is a research grant market, and a market for healthcare treatment of these conditions. This technology fills the need for innovative and versatile ways for detecting stressors and treating individuals who suffer from disorders like PTSD.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a recombinant protein that is designed to restore the activity of immune cells that have been exhausted in patients with cancer. This invention focuses specifically on the restoration of the anti-cancer activity of immune cells, in particular natural killer (NK) cells. Immune cell-based therapies are a widely utilized technique to fight off various illnesses. Notably, CAR-T cell therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment against cancer; however, CAR-T cell generated using exhausted T cells is not effective and continuous stimulation of CAR-T cell can lead to immune cell exhaustion. Immune cell exhaustion causes the cells to lose their functionality and reduces cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. Thus, once immune cells, like NK cells, have become exhausted, they become ineffective in fighting against cancer. There are other methods for restoring NK cell efficacy; however, these methods are not able to permanently restore exhausted NK cells. On the contrary, this invention can be used as an adjuvant with immune-cell based therapies in order to restore the NK cells during the treatment and/or the cell expansion and results in permanent restoration of the anti-cancer activity of those cells. Applications include restoring activity of exhausted immune-cells, increasing cytolytic activity, decreasing expression of inhibitory antigens on exhausted NK cells, enhancing cytokine secretion, inhibiting tumor growth, and can be added to the culture media during immune cell expansion. Advantages include permanently restoring immune-cell functionality, can be used on a variety of different innate or adaptive immune cells, and is not restricted to the treatment of cancer.",

As electronic devices with display screens are becoming increasingly common, the amount of time spent in front of screens is correspondingly growing. A UK survey found that the respondents spent, on average, 3 hours and 23 minutes of screen time per day, adding up to 50 days over a year. Screen time is particularly high among teens and tweens; in 2019, teens spent 7 hours and 22 minutes of screen time per day, even after excluding screen time for school or homework. Given the trends in screen time, it is no surprise that society has paid increased attention to the potential harmful effects of spending so much time in front of display screens. In particular, the blue light emitted by these devices has been linked to eye problems such as dry eye, cataracts, and macular degeneration, as well as disruption of biochemical processes like production of melatonin and other hormones. In response to these concerns, solutions have been developed that limit blue light exposure from electronic devices. Popular solution include software that eliminates blue light or simulates the natural sunrise/sunset cycle, tinted glasses, and sheets applied to the physical screen. This invention takes a different approach. Instead of merely eliminating the effects of blue light, it provides a controllable source of green light.

This is an important first step in the development of small molecule inhibitors that could not only be used to treat neuropathic pain and cancer, but also serve as a preventative measure against SARS-CoV-2 virus entry. COVID-19, a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to infect millions of people worldwide and no therapeutic has been made commercially available as of yet. One promising therapeutic approach would be to inhibit neuropilin 1 (NRP-1) signaling, as there is evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the VEGF-A/NRP-1 signaling pathway in order to gain viral entry into cells. Additionally, NRP-1 has also been a long-time focus of drug discovery efforts for cancer treatment and represents a novel target for treating neuropathic pain as well.

The robot can roll over flat and uneven terrain and, when obstacles are too big or difficult to maneuver around efficiently, the robot can transition into an unmanned aerial vehicle to get around them. Exploration of unknown areas presents terrain that is unpredictable and weather and temperature conditions that can be extreme. Furthermore, energy consumption of drones and robots is a major concern for space exploration. The problem is navigating the terrain in the most energy efficient way possible with a vehicle that can collect information effectively. The designs in this invention address those problems. The spherical cage allows the robot to roll on the ground over relatively flat terrain for up to an hour. The propellers on six axes allow the robot to produce the thrust to maneuver in any direction depending on the terrain. The propellers also allow the robot to take to the air to maneuver around extremely difficult terrain for up to 20 minutes. The combination of being able to roll and fly allows the robot to map out the most efficient route to its destination. This design can save more than 10 times the energy compared to other robots performing the same tasks. Furthermore, the sensors and electronics can either be in a sealed box or outside the inner sphere in the center of the robot depending on the expected conditions. This allows for more versatility in planned missions. The added protection for electronics may also be necessary depending on the required equipment. Energy is the driver of design, innovation, and expense. While designed primarily for space exploration, this robot could be used in agriculture, space flight, and defense. Covering large distances with complicated sensors is not always possible with a simple drone. This design provides a new solution to a drone-filled market concerned with energy consumption.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a method used primarily for mining that extracts metals using electrodeposition from a mixture of refined ore and molten salt in order to reduce the melting point. Much like the process of extracting aluminum from Bauxite, gold is extracted from ore using electrodeposition as a replacement for the widely used sodium cyanide mixture. Mining for precious metals like gold, silver, and copper fuel economies across the world. These metals are very commonplace--all of the major technology used on a daily basis requires these precious metals in some capacity. However, the state of mining technology relies heavily on cyanide in the United States and mercury and cyanide throughout the world. The health problems that stem from using poisonous mixtures are prevalent throughout the world in the environment and the surrounding populations. This technology is a replacement for both heap leaching and vat leaching for mercury and cyanide. Using molten salts and electrodeposition allows the mining industry to transition from the poisonous processes of the past, for a more efficient, environmentally friendly process for the future. Furthermore, this process in some cases increases the amount of metal extracted from the ore. While cyanide typically recovers about 90% of precious metals after several rounds of leaching, molten salt treatment as described here recovers between 90 and 98%. A similar process is used in extracting aluminum from Bauxite and has been extremely effective in that field. This technological step forward is to lower the required mixture temperature thus decreasing energy costs and making the idea more plausible for companies to adopt. Not only is this technology environmentally and morally responsible, but economically efficient. Mining is essential for the lives of people across the globe.

The solar dryer uses solar radiation, requiring minimal energy input. The dried food waste can be stored and used as needed to fertilize fields, feed livestock, or it can be sold as a commodity, turning a waste stream into a revenue stream. In the United States alone, a staggering 62.1 billion pounds of fruit, vegetable, and grain waste end up in the landfill each year. This amounts to an economic loss of $75.5 billion. The biggest constraint on salvaging this food waste is time: food waste needs to be processed before it rots.

    "ip_description": "University of Arizona researchers have created sugar-based low molecular weight hydrogels that spontaneously self-assemble through weak, noncovalent intermolecular interactions. These gels are thixotropic, biocompatible, and biodegradable. Despite being held together through non-covalent interactions, these hydrogels exhibit greater mechanical strength than other non-cross-linked hydrogels. These hydrogels are biocompatible and biodegradable since the materials are based on sugars. The other advantages of these low molecular weight hydrogels include resistance to acidic and salty environments, stability at human body temperature, and formation in water without requiring additives. These hydrogels are based on alkyl glycolipids which are readily produced in large quantities through a scalable, high-yield synthetic process. Hydrogels have been utilized in many biomedical fields, including dermatology, drug delivery systems, stem cell delivery systems, bonding and coating systems, tissue engineering or repairing systems, wound healing, cell culture, etc. One current field of study is concerned with tissue and tissue manipulation using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) compounds. Another field of study is using biopolymer-based hydrogels as scaffolds or artificial extracellular matrices that provide growth spaces for cells from the viewpoint of tissue engineering. The scaffolds or artificial extracellular matrices allow cells to grow better or in desired directions for the purpose of tissue engineering. Some of the biopolymers currently used for producing hydrogels include polysaccharides such as glycogen, chitosan, cellulose, and hyaluronic acid. These biopolymers are often converted into hydrogels by physical crosslinking or irreversible chemical crosslinking. The process of cross-linking biopolymers to produce hydrogels results in high molecular weight hydrogels and requires additional time and cost. Unlike high molecular weight hydrogels, low molecular weight gels (LMW) are composed of small molecules that aggregate via noncovalent interactions and form fibrous 3-D networks or porous structures that immobilize solvent. Thus, LMW gels do not need any cross-linking steps, and therefore, are less costly and time consuming. In addition, LMW gels are known to be thermoreversible, gel at low concentrations, and have high tolerance towards salts. LMW hydrogels are some of the most unique gels, as they are mainly composed of water; this allows their potential use in diverse applications in soft materials and biomaterials including drug delivery, cell growth, enzyme immobilization, and tissue engineering. Sugars have long been of interest for use in LMW hydrogels. However, common hydrogel compositions with functional properties utilizing sugars have relied on complex gelator molecules with relatively complex chemical syntheses or are based on materials harvested from natural sources requiring extensive effort. Therefore, there is a need for a simple method of producing LMW hydrogels using readily available sources.",

As ARDS onset can occur very quickly after the appearance of mild respiratory symptoms of COVID-19, it is essential to have a means to monitor and quickly identify respiratory decline before it reaches a critical level.\n\nCurrent evaluation of respiratory distress and failure uses cumbersome and relatively invasive pulmonary function tests (e.g. spirometry, lung volume, lung diffusion capacity, etc.).

Quantum communication makes use of quantum physics to create highly secure networks that are immune to many techniques used to intercept the communication while in transit. But because quantum information degrades quickly, there are limitations on how far the information can travel. This limitation is addressed by placing intermediate nodes between the source and destination, which act as \u201crepeaters\u201d to break the transmission into several steps of shorter distance. However, existing quantum repeater technology is inefficient and introduces latency into the transmission. Furthermore, the security of a quantum communication network relies on the assumption that the nodes used to receive and transmit information are themselves secure. If a node were to be compromised, it could undermine the security network. Accordingly, as more repeater nodes are added, the network as a whole becomes less secure. This invention uses surface codes, a technique used for error correction in quantum technologies, to implement a quantum communication network that leaves the nodes less susceptible to compromise and eliminates the latency typically introduced at repeater nodes.

Epifluidics is a rapidly evolving area of microfluidics, where devices are applied to the surface of the skin, typically to collect tiny amounts of sweat for analysis. The sweat can then be analyzed within the device to look for particular markers. Research suggests this type of technology can be used to non-invasively detect many health-related metrics, including hydration levels, blood sugar levels, and blood alcohol levels.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a replication method for volume holographic optical elements and waveguide couplers. It is a new configuration for fabricating transmission holograms using composite master holograms and reflection holograms using a pair of master holograms. It produces a method that is scalable and able to increase the type of waveguide holograms that can be fabricated. This invention has the potential for commercial application in augmented reality displays and solar energy systems. This method utilizes successful replication techniques from prism-coupled assemblies without the drawbacks of limited spatial frequencies in those systems. Volume Holographic Optical Elements (VHOE) are a type of diffractive optical elements with applications in solar energy, display systems, security, and medical imaging. Holographic optical elements (HOE) can be classified into two main types, thin and volume. Historically, VHOEs have been used in customizable applications, but this application is becoming more commercially available as technology matures. Manufacturability still lags development so improvements to ease manufacturing are valuable to process efficiently an increased commercial demand. Currently, contact-copy is the main manufacturing process. It uses a master hologram that creates copies of itself through contact with a photopolymer. However, this process is not well suited to input beams that are non-planar or when apertures of the VHOE need to be well-defined. A prism-coupled technique used total internal reflection of beams to create replication holograms without these limitations, yet the technique required an air gap between the master hologram assembly and replication hologram, which prevented the production of waveguide holograms because the air gap limited spatial frequencies of the interference pattern created by the object and reference beams.",

    "published_date": "5/13/2021",
    "ip_description": "This technology is a method of detecting an online impostor using keystroke dynamics without requiring prior collection of behavioral data from the true user. Keystroke dynamics is an area of behavioral biometrics that attempts to identify or authenticate a user by collecting data about how a user types, such as the length of time between key presses and the duration a key is depressed. This information can then be used to detect changes in typing behavior, which may suggest the person typing is an impostor or bot. This technique has seen widespread adoption in recent years and adds a layer of security that can augment traditional knowledge-based authentication such as providing a username and password. One limitation of keyboard dynamics for authentication is that it usually requires establishing a baseline by training the detection mechanism with normal typing activity by the authentic user. As a result, keyboard dynamics is generally ineffective if the user is new or no prior data has been collected on the user\u2019s behavior. This invention is innovative in that it requires no prior user interaction and therefore can be used for new accounts or in applications where behavioral data is not collected across multiple interaction sessions. Applications include online fraud prevention in eCommerce, banking, and insurance, as well as enterprise identity and access management. Advantages include requiring no training period to establish a baseline and the ability to work in concert with existing behavioral biometric techniques.",

Mood disorders and negative moods are pervasive in the modern world. The World Health Organization estimates that over a quarter of a million people worldwide suffer from depression. In the same vein, an estimated 7.1% of all US adults experienced at least one major depressive episode in 2017. And these numbers are limited to the clinical definition of depression; other people may experience shorter-lived depressed mood or other negative moods but would not meet the clinical criteria to be classified as suffering from a depressive disorder. Mood is also closely intertwined with general health and wellbeing. Research suggests that adults with a depressive disorder or depressive symptoms have a 64% increased risk of coronary artery disease, and early treatment of depression can decrease the risk of heart attacks and strokes by nearly 50%. Furthermore, depression accounts for 490 million disability days taken off work each year in the US, at an estimated economic cost of $100 billion per year.

Diffraction efficiency is an important characteristic of VHOEs, and the most basic technique for controlling the diffraction efficiency during fabrication is to use separate beams to expose the holographic material and measure the material\u2019s efficiency. However, this technique is time consuming and requires additional equipment. Ideally, a measurement technique that used the exposure beam would reduce both these limitations.\n\nThe technique proposed in this invention works by periodically blocking an exposing beam during the fabrication and measuring the power of the diffracted beam using a power meter. Once the diffraction efficiency of the VHOE is measured to reach the desired value, the exposing beams can be shut off. Since this measurement is performed in real-time, the method has potential to account for the local variations in the material or laser power variation that cause the necessary exposure time to fluctuate between samples.\n\nMost Volume Holographic Elements (VHOEs) must attain certain diffraction efficiency depending on the design. In many designs the diffraction efficiency should be maximized, while in other designs, such as exit pupil expanders in waveguide display systems, the diffraction efficiency is intentionally a lower value. In other setups, light from a separate laser at a different wavelength from the construction wavelength and at a separate incident angle is used to measure the diffraction efficiency. The diffraction efficiency at the construction wavelength can then be obtained through mathematical approximations. However, this method requires additional equipment and complicated experimental setups and the mathematical approximations reduce the accuracy of the method.\n\nIn this invention, a new technique for monitoring the diffraction efficiency of VHOEs in real-time is proposed that has potential for higher accuracy and greater simplicity than previous setups. The invention has potential for fabricating VHOEs that have precise tolerance in the required diffraction efficiency.\n\nApplications:\n*   Industrial manufacturing of volume holographic elements\n    *   Waveguide holograms\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Simpler/less equipment\n*   Precise and real-time",

The idea is to have terrestrial quantum networks be connected with low earth orbit satellites and have a subnetwork of medium and greater earth orbit satellites. This invention capitalizes on the security and speed of quantum networks and common satellite communications. Quantum communication takes advantage of the laws of quantum physics to protect data. These laws allow particles\u2014typically photons of light for transmitting data along optical cables\u2014to take on a state of superposition, which means they can represent multiple combinations of 1 and 0 simultaneously. The particles are known as quantum bits, or qubits. If viewed, qubits break down to either a 1 or 0 because of their fragile quantum state. This makes quantum communication secure because information cannot be viewed or tampered with when it is being sent. Quantum networks facilitate the transmission of information in qubits between physically separated quantum processors. A quantum processor is a small quantum computer able to perform quantum logic gates on a certain number of qubits. Quantum networks work in a similar way to classical networks.

Millions of people in the US and globally are diagnosed with respiratory diseases every year. It is believed that more than 30% of the information about the patient comes from nonverbal cues. In routine doctor-patient interactions, much of the nonverbal acoustic information is not captured and is lost. This information is valuable for all cases and breathing sounds are a main source of information in diagnosing a patient with a respiratory illness, irregularity, or disease. Current methods involve spirometry which is a way to measure airway obstruction by measuring inflows and outflows.

This is an electrically driven device without fixed valves that functions with \"functional equivalents\" of valves via a sliding vane. The vane serves to propel flow as well as to partition flow. A high bandwidth positive displacement reversible pump/motor with two embodiments is proposed. More than 5 million Americans have heart failure, with 670,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, such as ventricular assist devices (VADs) and total artificial heart (TAH), have emerged as approved frontline therapy, providing restoration of failing circulation, as either a bridge to transplantation, or an alternative to transplantation as destination therapy. While MCS is vital and effective in restoring hemodynamics, sadly, more than 70% of implanted MCS patients require re-hospitalization within one year of implant due to thrombosis and/or bleeding. Additionally, infection from device bulk and exiting drivelines is a major limitation as well. Most current MCS devices are either piston-cylinder-like positive displacement architectures (SynCardia, Carmat, Berlin Heart) with valves to direct flow directions or fast spinning turbine or centrifugal architectures. The proposed invention architectures are able to generate the same amount of required flow rate with a more compact size and at a dramatically reduced speed due to its positive displacement feature. The reduced speed would lead to lower shear stress on blood and lower blood damage. As positive displacement architectures, valves are eliminated, thus reducing valve-related blood damage.

    "ip_description": "This invention represents a new chemical composition of photoresponsive, polymer photoresists, where the refractive index of the polymer can be modulated via UV radiation to facilitate the arbitrary writing of optical waveguides and other photonic devices in the material. The material can be spun on to any substrate or existing photonic device architecture and, through lithography, create polymer waveguides and enable interconnecting of individual silicon integrated photonics chips, functioning as an inexpensive optical interconnect medium. The ability to transfer an optical signal between waveguide devices is critical in the formation of optical printed circuit boards, which can provide faster processing and potentially lower cost than traditional electric printed circuit boards. Optical interconnections can be directly written to connect spatially separated waveguides using maskless lithography. The material composition leads to low optical propagation loss at telecommunications wavelengths such as 1310nm and 1550nm. A photonic integrated circuit (PIC) integrates one or more optical components, such as modulators, lasers, detectors, multiplexers and demultiplexers, attenuators and optical amplifiers, into a system. Large-scale PICs, like their large-scale electronic counterparts, may have complex organization, requiring effective interconnections for desired system performance. Next generation photonic devices have ever increasing needs for accelerated methods to fabricate waveguiding elements and optical interconnects. In particular, polymer waveguides play an important role as optical interconnects facilitating incorporation of silicon photonics elements into the electronic processing framework, which is the new paradigm for fulfilling the demand on data centers and high performance computing. Hence, there is a compelling need to simplify and streamline polymer waveguide fabrication techniques which require spatial control of refractive index (RI, or n).

    "ip_description": "This invention proposes combining snapshot phase-shifting interferometry with high resolution polarization imaging to create quantitative phase maps from diffraction microscopy. A polarization grating separates the incident beam into object and reference beams, and a digital camera captures four phase-shifted interferograms from polarization filters to reconstruct a high spatial resolution phase map. Due to the common path configuration and snapshot feature, the proposed system provides a feasible way for real time quantitative phase measurement with minimal environmental impact. Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) refers to methods of collecting high resolution images and using both phase and amplitude data to create quantitative phase maps. These are particularly valuable for microscopic examination of tissue samples because data can be collected with minimal harm to the tissue and in some cases may be collected in vivo. Traditional QPI methods require widely separated optical paths, which can introduce noise through vibrations in the setup or even air turbulence. Diffraction phase microscopy and other off-axis imaging systems reduce this noise through using a common optical path for the object and reference beam, but this configuration often limits the size of the imaging field that can be collected. Also, creating the phase maps can be computationally intensive, preventing real-time imaging. Algorithm refinement can reduce the processing time for holographic imaging (another off-axis image collection method), as can optimization of graphics processing. This invention overcomes these limitations by using a diffraction phase microscope with polarization grating, phase-shifting interferometry, and a polarization camera to create a larger field real-time phase map. Similar approaches use holography with spatial light modulators, diffraction phase microscopy with optimized graphics card processing, polarization wavefront shaping, and digital holography with polarization states.",

This technology provides a means of delivery of GI therapies for a number of indications without requiring metabolism through the liver or other systemic exposure.\n\nAs one example of GI disease, colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. Patients with colorectal cancer often receive chemotherapy as a primary treatment or as a pre/post-surgery treatment for their cancer. One of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of colorectal cancer is 5-Fluorouracil. 5-Fluorouracil is used due to its high effectiveness rates against colorectal cancer. Current oral administrations of pro-drugs for 5-Fluorouracil, capecitabine and tegafur, must be metabolized in the liver before 5-FU can be released, thus, the drug is not concentrated in the colon, but rather is systematically available. This leads to adverse effects which might be avoided if 5-FU was specifically released in the colon and remained concentrated there. Therefore, there is a need for a method that allows release of 5-FU or other active pharmaceutical ingredients in the colon.\n\nApplications:\n*   Colorectal cancer treatment\n*   Stomach cancer treatment\n*   Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment\n*   Infectious diarrhea treatment\n*   Infectious bacterial treatment\n*   Intestinal bacterial overgrowth treatment\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Targeted rather than systemic delivery\n*   Reduces systemic exposure\n*   Reduces off-target effects",

The idea is that there are going to be so many satellites and other debris in low-Earth orbit that collisions between objects may become inevitable. Because of the high density of space debris, those inevitable collisions could cause a cascade where any collision creates a greater likelihood of future collisions. The reality of increased space debris makes space travel and launches more difficult. Furthermore, the satellites that orbit the Earth often in low-Earth orbit are in constant danger of impact from space debris.\n\nThe Gatekeeper is a solution to the inevitable collision problem between satellites and space debris. The Gatekeeper is designed to be installed in a satellite that can determine the probability of a collision with space debris and warn the satellite/users if there are possible collisions. This warning system would allow the satellite time enough to make proper collision avoidance adjustments.\n\nSince the late 1950s, humanity has what can be regarded as an obsession with sending persons and things into space. Since then, many satellite constellations are currently orbiting Earth for global communications, Global Positioning System etc. Researchers are constantly working on small, micro, and nano satellites as well as different ways to improve communication and wireless transfers of information. Expansions into space have allowed humanity to exist in an entirely different way.\n\nHowever, low-Earth orbit now has thousands of pieces of space debris that threaten to damage multi-million dollar projects as well as the health of the utilization of low-Earth orbit space for generations to come.

Intraoral cameras are an alternative that dentists may use instead of mirrors to review and examine the mouth of patients. The added benefit of using an intraoral camera compared to a mirror is that it provides the dentist high-resolution images of a patient's mouth that are real-time and the data can be stored for future reference. These images can be stored for time analysis of patients for better health care by providing timed data. There are three main restrictions with current methods: Some devices do not have a flexible head; therefore, to navigate around the tongue or bend the camera, one would have to move the full device. Images collected do not have analysis on them. It requires a trained dentist to manually review the image and provide details on analysis. Devices are expensive, usually priced at more than $1,000.

    "ip_description": "This invention is an adaptive optics (AO) system for broadband and/or polarization dependent light. The system includes a wavefront sensor and compensator, and the compensator splits the broad waveband into different wavelength and/or polarization states, applies compensation, then recombines the light into a single wavefront with distortions that may be compensated by following optical elements of the AO system. The wavefront compensator is based on known optical corrections techniques but applied in a new way. The area of adaptive optics and correction techniques applied to optical signals is patent dense, but this combination of techniques and application appear to be novel within the field. Adaptive optics (AO) is a technology used to improve the performance of optical systems by reducing the effect of incoming wavefront distortions by deforming a mirror or applying an optical filter like a spatial light modulator (SLM) in order to compensate for distortions. In existing AO systems, the compensation is the same for light of all wavelength and polarization states. The system works well as long as the distortions for different wavelength and polarization state are the same. For light sources with a broad range of wavelength and different polarization states, the distortion compensation will be incomplete, leading to greater blur in the spatial resolution in the resulting image. This invention proposes a design of an AO system that can better compensate distortions in broadband and polarized light.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is an efficient, green route for oxidizing simple pyrenes without any metal-mediated catalyst or reagent, with desired product in high yield. This direct oxidation method may be used to synthesize organic semi-conductors for use as photovoltaics, transistors, LEDs while avoiding poor yields, product impurities, and expensive work-up. This method has been demonstrated for selectively oxidizing the K-region of pyrenes using a meta-free oxidizing agent to produce a pyrene 4,5-dione and/or a pyrene 4,5,9,10-tetraone compounds. Pyrene compounds are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules that are used widely in various applications including, but not limited to, use as fluorescent probes and starting materials for producing various organic electronic components such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field effect transistors (OFETs), and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Chemical modifications of pyrenes through a variety of methods enable their incorporation into more complex chemical systems make them useful starting materials for larger organic semiconductors as they enable the extension of the \u03c0- conjugated system via simple condensation reactions with ortho-diamines. This strategy enables the synthesis of imine rich N-heteroacene chains known as pyrene-fused pyrazaacenes (PPAs) that exhibit a wide range tunable semiconducting properties (p-type to n-type) unlike their nitrogen-free acene counterparts. Owing to the two Clar sextets provided per pyrene subunit, PPAs are air-stable even above 500C. Even though ortho-quinones of pyrenes are useful starting materials for the synthesis of PPAs and other organic semi-conductors, their synthesis via direct oxidation of pyrene derivatives have been difficult due to lack of selectivity to desired products, even with expensive transition metal catalysts, as well as the expense and loss of product during purification due to formation of tarry residue.

    "published_date": "5/13/2020",
    "ip_description": "This invention is a new hybrid cementitious material that has a high viscosity rate to be used in pumpable roof support application in underground mining. This hybrid is a fusion of geopolymer and biopolymer that results in a high load stiffness, high peak strength, and large residual strength compared to current cementitious material used in this application. This increases the safety of underground mining.\n\nUnderground mining is essential for acquiring materials in everyday use. Underground mining consists of digging tunnels and/or shafts into the earth. As these structures are built in the early and equipment is moved into the earth to extract the material, strong support structures are required within the tunnels and shafts to prevent ground falls. Ground falls lead to 8 to 10 fatalities and approximately 800 injuries globally each year. Therefore, design and construction of roof supports, to prevent ground falls, are critical to ensure safety. The intrinsic supports systems, such as roof bolts, and standing support systems, such as cribs and posts, are the two most common roof support systems. These support systems provide the three key factors for roof supports. These key factors include maximum load-carrying capacity, stiffness, and residual strength. Secondary factors include timing of installation, stability of support as it is loaded, and capability of support system to provide skin control. New technology has provided a third option of pumpable roof supports, due to its ease and speed of instability. However, there are issues with finding a satisfactory pumpable cementitious grout material that has high load stiffness, high peak strength, and large residual strength when compared to the two preferred methods.\n\nApplications:\n*   Underground mining\n*   Coal / hard rock mining\n*   Construction\n*   Energy\n\nAdvantages:\n*   High strength\n*   Fast setting",

The proposed variants of pixelated polarization filters would have applications in display and sensor designs and could cover light sources, such as organic light emitting diodes or liquid crystal light panel, to form a polarization display which can display an image of arbitrary polarization states. This is a patent-dense area, and the novelty in this invention is that the polarization camera design is perfectly achromatic for measurement of linear polarization state and the process reduces the transition region between pixels. For many applications, there is a need to create an array of polarization filters with well-defined shape and orientation. For existing CMOS and CCD optical sensor arrays, the size of the pixel can be of the order of one micron or smaller. There is a need to create patterned polarization filters that have the same dimension and shape as the pixel. The current problem in practice, is a transition region between regions of one alignment angle and an adjacent region of an alternate alignment angle. This can range from 0.5 to 5 microns and limits the spatial resolution of the patterns in the polarization filter.

This method provides a fast, low-cost method for acquiring detailed multi-spectral data for cell objects.\n\nImaging biological cells and tissues is central to research and medical diagnosis, and imaging tissues requires contrast to distinguish areas of interest from the background. In the past, use of dye or other form of staining or tagging structures was necessary to achieve sufficient contrast but this contrast data was qualitative rather than quantitative. Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) emerged as a method to create a phase map of the sample to indicate refractive / optical path differences through tissue structure. Digital holography captures both phase and amplitude data from interference of reference and object waves, but phase maps do not separate tissue physical thickness differences from refractive differences. Instead, use of multiwavelength digital holography can provide quantitative 3D color images and dispersion information.\n\nApplications:\n*   Health research\n*   Biological imaging\n*   Cell and tissue imaging\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Faster and more accurate\n*   Lower cost than current methods",

    "published_date": "4/15/2020",
    "ip_description": "This technology is an improvement to the well-established microscopy technique structured illumination microscopy (SIM), which uses a periodic structured pattern of light to image a sample. In SIM, it is common for artifacts to arise during imaging, because the pattern is often distorted due to aberration and index mismatches in samples. These artifacts distort the image and reduce the amount of information that can be extracted from the raw data. This technology is capable of correcting distortions in challenging experimental situations, such as strong background scattering, low signal-to-noise-ratio, and a sparse sample structure. In addition, it is easily applied to existing hardware, making it cost-effective and simple to implement into existing workflows, as opposed to current solutions which utilize much more expensive adaptive optics to accomplish the same effect. Structured illumination microscopy has been around since the late 1990s but is still being improved as a technique. SIM can be used in multiple ways: optical sectioning structured illumination microscopy (OS-SIM) and super resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM), among others. OS-SIM allows the technique to act much like a confocal microscope, reducing out-of-focus light and thus increasing contrast. SR-SIM can be used to increase a microscope\u2019s resolution below the diffraction limit of light, previously thought to be impossible. While it is currently better suited to techniques like OS-SIM, this technology has the potential to be applied to both types of SIM. Other techniques for reduction of out-of-focus light exist, like Leica\u2019s Computational Clearing technology, but they are more limited in their potential applications. This technology has the potential to cheaply and easily improve results from existing structured illumination microscopy hardware in a variety of different applications.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is an automated label-free method to measure the affinity of membrane proteins for lipids by using conventional small molecule mass spectrometry (MS) to monitor lipid exchange between lipoprotein nanoparticles called nanodiscs. We call this method lipid exchange-mass spectrometry (LX-MS). The concept is that if a membrane protein binds a certain type of lipid, it will shift the equilibrium distribution of lipids between empty (tagged) nanodiscs and membrane protein (untagged) nanodiscs. We quantify the equilibrium distribution by measuring the lipid composition in the membrane protein nanodiscs after exchange. By titrating the lipid composition, we can determine the optimal ratio of lipids surrounding a membrane protein. This assay should be general to any membrane proteins or lipids and uses small amounts of samples.\n\nMembrane proteins make up the majority of drug targets yet only account for 2\u20133% of high-resolution structures. Thus, there is a great need for improvements in structural biology and drug discovery with membrane proteins.

    "ip_description": "TMEM184B is a relatively uncharacterized 7-pass transmembrane protein that is a member of the Transporter-Opsin-GPCR (TOG) superfamily of proteins. It was discovered that over-expression of TMEM184B caused a reduction in scratching in response to interleukin-31 (Il-31) exposure. This was surprising given previous studies had shown that knock-out of TMEM184B resulted in a reduction in Il-31 induced scratching. Increasing the activity and/or abundance of TMEM184B in a patient may be used to treat itch. Chronic itch affects up to 15% of the population. It may be caused by inflammation or more serious diseases of the kidneys, liver, nerves, and cancer. Chronic itch can impair quality of life, leading to disrupted sleep and anxiety / depression. Somatosensory neurons transduce multiple types of stimuli, including temperature, chemical, and physical changes in the local environment of their nerve endings. Nerve endings receiving these cues can also directly sense inflammatory compounds, and this inflammation alters their response properties to cause hyperalgesia (heightened responses to noxious stimuli) and allodynia (painful responses to non-noxious stimuli). A common consequence of increased skin inflammation is the triggering of itch. Acute and chronic itch are significant morbidities in humans. Itch-causing pathological conditions have a variety of causes, including skin disorders (atopic dermatitis), drug-induced reactions, systemic disorders such as liver disease, and other neurological disorders. The sensation of itch is distinct from pain and is carried by a subset of itch-specific somatosensory neurons called pruriceptive neurons with cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Skin itch is triggered by release of pro-inflammatory compounds such as cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31), thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and histamine from mast cells and epithelial cells, which act upon membrane receptors and channels present in epidermal nerve endings. In addition to chemical itch, mechanical stimuli can evoke similar itch sensations but rely on a distinct spinal circuit.",

In addition, the invention surrounds the process and manufacturing of these newly formulated Suramin microparticles and nanoparticles so they can be effectively used in the treatment of wounds. Specifically, these new formulations would be utilized for wound healing purposes in mucositis and diabetic foot ulcers.\n\nOral mucositis is a consequence of chemotherapy and radiation treatment of head and neck cancer, the third most common cancers with nearly 550,000 cases per year. However, chemotherapy and radiation have horrible side effects, with the most common being ulcers and sores of the mouth and throat, otherwise known as mucositis. Nearly 40% of patients undergoing chemotherapy and 100% of patients receiving radiation experience mucositis, which results in pain, trouble breathing and swallowing, and infections. In addition, diabetic foot ulcers occur in nearly 15% of all diabetic patients and precede nearly 85% of all diabetic related amputations.\n\nThese serious complications of highly prevalent diseases have limited treatment options. If left untreated, mucositis and diabetic foot ulcers have horrible effects on patients ranging from pain and infections to the loss of a limb. This invention re-formulates Suramin to help promote wound healing. Currently, Suramin can only be administered intravenously, which means a medical professional must administer each dose and each dose is delivered invasively. This technology could potentially allow Suramin to be administered by more patient-friendly routes including non-invasive targeted routes. Early studies have already shown its effectiveness in increasing the healing process of diabetic related sores in a mouse model.",

    "ip_number": "UA20-106",
    "published_date": "3/25/2020",
    "ip_description": "For many applications, the output of a laser diode is coupled into an optical fiber to direct the light beam more easily. This fiber can be doped with rare earth metals such as Erbium to increase efficiency and absorption. Instead of using Erbium (Er3+) exclusively for doped fiber lasers, this method proposes the use of codoped Er3+ fiber lasers with Holmium (Ho3+) and Dysprosium (Dy3+). Current Er3+-doped lasers can only reach the 2.8-2.9 micron wavelength range but deliver a high power output. Ho3+/ Dy3+-doped lasers lack the power output of Er3+-doped lasers but are able to reach wavelength regions above 3 microns. By codoping Ho3+ and Dy3+with Er3+, compact all-fiber lasers above 3-micron meter can be developed with the use of readily available, high power, and efficient diode lasers.\n\nBackground:  Erbium is the most common rare earth element used in fiber lasers because the available atomic energy levels for excitation and decay better match light energy output (wavelengths) from cheaper diode sources. Fiber laser beam quality is high and the power output is over 6kW, which is very high compared with a traditional gas or crystal laser. Fiber lasers are also efficient (70%-80%) which means they consume less power and are easier to cool. Because the beam remains focused within a fiber, it can be very small which makes fiber lasers an excellent source for laser cutting.\n\nA fiber laser requires an energy source, such as 980nm pumped light from a laser diode coupled to the fiber, to produce the beam. This light energy source stimulates emission in the doped material of the fiber which creates the beam along the laser fiber. Emission is generally lower energy than the pumped energy \u2013 1535nm compared with 980nm \u2013 but some heavy metal fluoride upconversion fiber lasers (ZBLAN) use multiple stimulated phonon transitions to produce higher energy emissions (480nm output with 1140nm input). ZBLAN fiber lasers may also be used for longer wavelength emission in the \u201ceye-safe\u201d region beyond 1400nm though output power remains lower than for shorter wavelengths.\n\nApplications:\n*   Material processing\n*   Medical\n*   Sensing\n*   Imaging\n*   Spectroscopy\n*   Defense (directed energy)\n*   Telecommunications\n\nAdvantages:\n*   3-micron meter wavelength regions\n*   Cost efficient\n*   Energy efficient",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a new type of lipid vesicle or liposome that can be used to encapsulate drugs and genes for therapeutic applications. It improves upon existing liposome formulations in its increased stability, subsequent increased circulation time, and effectiveness as a nanocarrier. For many years, therapeutic drugs were released in an uncontrolled and untargeted manner. This often resulted in drastic side effects, most dramatically exemplified by the side effects of chemotherapy treatment. Much research has been conducted to create more advanced systems for drug delivery that allow for controlled release of the therapeutic payload, with better control of temporal and spatial distribution of the drug. One such advancement in the field of advanced drug delivery systems has been the liposome, or lipid vesicle. Liposomes consist of one or more bilayers of lipid molecules that form a shell with an empty core when dispersed in a liquid medium such as water or blood. They have been used to encapsulate drugs and deliver them at controlled rates to specific targets in the human body, but have conventionally been prone to many issues such as instability, leading to unsatisfactory release kinetics and circulation times. The technology has implements a liposome based nanoparticle that will improve upon the current technologies. Cholesterol has been included in liposome formulations because it helps to stabilize the lipid membrane, but it is prone to transfer from the liposome into other biomembranes, lipoproteins, and lipid vesicles, which again destabilizes the liposome. The inventors have discovered innovative way to prevent cholesterol transfer from the bilayer and increase stability. Applications include delivery of drugs such as cancer therapeutics and delivery of genes for gene therapy. Advantages include more stable, better circulation times, more effective drug delivery, and tuneable to accommodate various payloads.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is an improvement to a commonly used drug delivery vehicle: liposomes. Liposomes, while useful for their improved pharmacokinetics, have not demonstrated significantly improved efficacy and patient survival. This may be in part due to the fact that generally only one drug can be loaded per liposome. However, this technology allows co-delivery of multiple drugs. Coupled with its sphingolipid composition, this technology has the potential to result in therapeutics that not only have improved stability and circulation time, but also greater efficacy in treating patients. It is also a versatile approach that enables the creation of liposomal formulations of drugs which are not currently possible with existing liposomes. Liposomes (spherical lipid bilayers enclosing an aqueous center) can be used to deliver hydrophilic drugs (in the center cavity) or hydrophobic drugs (within the lipid membrane). Compared to non-liposomal drugs, liposomes circulate in the bloodstream for a longer period of time, and they are also capable of accumulating at the sites of tumors or infections. Improvements to their structures have been made\u2014they can be temperature- or pH-sensitive for controlled release, or coated in PEG to reduce immune detection\u2014but there is still much room for improvement in clinical outcomes. Traditional liposomes compete with other methods of drug delivery, such as lipid nanoparticles and micelles, but this invention is poised to begin a new era of improved liposomes with broader applicability in terms of payload, and improved therapeutic outcomes.",

This novel blends of filaments have better properties for 3D printing bone scaffolds with improved degradation kinetics and functionalities. Due to an aging global population, the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders is increasing. Today, small volumes of bone or bone-like materials are commonly used in a variety of treatments to help heal or fuse a patient\u2019s bones as necessary. These bone grafts are generally autografts (bone sourced from the patient\u2019s own body), or allografts (bone from another person\u2019s body). Each type of graft has its own issues: taking bone from elsewhere in a patient adds cost, complexity, and pain for the patient to the procedure, and sourcing bone from another person leads to potential for rejection by the immune system. Bespoke, patient-specific bone scaffolds that can be made on demand are being developed to circumvent these issues, through methods such as electrospinning and various types of 3D printing. Currently, most filaments available for purchase for use in fused deposition modeling-type 3D printers consist of a single type of material, which limits their chemical and mechanical properties.

The display panel is either LCD, LED, or OLD and it displays a certain pattern onto the freeform surface. The cameras then record how the pattern is distorted on the surface and this is fed into a processing unit where it calculates the surface shape. This invention involves a robust and easy to use deflectometry system for measuring freeform surfaces. The system includes three cameras, two which are positioned at the edge of the display panel and one in the middle. The processing that this invention uses consists of a trained neural network to more accurately calculate the surface shape. The two main issues with freeform surface metrology are that systems of this nature are not robust enough and they are often very difficult to use. It\u2019s difficult to use because the location of parts must be precise and information about the surface must be known to be able to make a precise calculation. The system will be robust as the cameras and display panel are integrated into one unit.

The invention describes a system for bilateral electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve that can be implanted in the human body with the goal of ameliorating symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. This device can be used with neonatal populations, where there have been limited therapies approved.\n\nPulmonary hypertension is a group of diseases characterized by elevated blood pressure in the lungs. There are five types defined by the World Health Organization, each based on the root cause of the elevated blood pressure. All types of pulmonary hypertension are serious, and if untreated, can lead to right heart failure and even death--group 3 pulmonary hypertension has a 1-year mortality of 46%, followed by group 2 at 40.9%. Among neonatal patients, there are limited therapies and drugs that have been approved for the treatment of PAH. Currently nitric oxide is an existing treatment, but it is not widely used. Pulmonary hypertension is currently not curable, but its symptoms can sometimes be managed. Partly thanks to its \u201corphan\u201d status, a number drugs have been recently developed to treat group 1 pulmonary hypertension directly, but other types are often approached in terms of treating the underlying disease or even surgically. There is a clear need for more and better therapies for pulmonary hypertension, given that the current drugs are expensive, can have unpleasant side effects, and cannot be applied to all groups of pulmonary hypertension. This invention has the potential to fill that gap, and provide a way of treating all groups of pulmonary hypertension with few to no side effects.\n\nApplications:\n* Nonpharmacological treatment of pulmonary hypertension\n\nAdvantages:\n* Targeted to neonatal population, where limited therapies exist\n* Stimulation results in few to no side effects\n* Technique can be applied to all groups of pulmonary hypertension unlike current pharmacological interventions\n* The invention may also be more cost-effective than current drugs\n* Once implanted, patient will rarely need to return to the point of care whereas some drugs require repeated or constant infusions",

This invention generates and measures an RF signal (millimeter wave) and processes the data with machine learning to extract and identify body motion within a region. Unlike other systems that focus on breathing or heart rate, this system can distinguish larger scale motions of specific limbs.\n\nThis detection system includes both hardware and computationally efficient algorithms to detect motion and interpret it in terms of human skeletal components. Similar patents focus on detecting motions through walls for security or detecting motions for computer-human interactions.\n\nCurrently, there are several technologies that are able to provide imaging of humans through a wall or another obstruction. These technologies rely on identifying vital signs like minor chest movements during breaths to detect humans, but these can be inaccurately recorded in complex environments. The tracking of skeletal structure motions would enable more detailed and accurate imaging.\n\nClothing is highly transparent in the millimeter-wave band of electromagnetic radiation which makes millimeter-wave sensors an obvious choice for security screening purposes. Passive and active millimeter wave systems are commonly used to detect concealed objects. However, the nature of this longer-wave technology far outside the visible wavelength range makes image processing of the data collected more intensive; the data must be heavily analyzed to create 2D images. Therefore, it is advantageous to use efficient algorithms for faster frame rates.\n\nAs an alternative to monitoring systems, some groups are investigating uses of RFID chips because they have become cheaper with longer lasting battery life. Yet, these require multiple chips for multiple motions and have applications more for specific medical purposes than remote monitoring.\n\nApplications:\n*   Security monitoring and threat detection\n*   Remote medical monitoring\n*   Detailed body motion sensing for computer-human interactions\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Same methodology applies to systems using single or multiple axes of motion\n*   Computationally efficient",

This invention is concerned with delaying the onset of transition and the subsequent breakdown to turbulence as far downstream on the vehicle as possible. As the transition process in high-speed boundary layers is associated with strong unsteadiness, large pressure fluctuations, and intermittency, it may also be beneficial to accelerate transition to quickly establish a fully turbulent state.

Using bioelectrical impedance analysis as a diagnostic tool for breast cancer screening through examination of the electrical characteristics of breast tissue provides information on a continuous basis to patients in the field without the need for radiological investigations. Measurement of fat and water mass through established algorithms help assess the standard density and composition of breast tissue and identify lesions and abnormalities indicative of breast cancer.\n\nBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the U.S. and makes up 15% of all new cancer diagnoses. In 2016, 3.5 million women in the U.S. were living with a history of breast cancer. Approximately 1 in 8 women (12%) will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime.

Ambient dried aerogels utilize calculated levels of temperature and pressure using certain chemicals to remove the liquids from the aerogel. This technology is a method of preparation of low density, porous aerogels without the use of supercritical temperatures and pressures from bridged polysilsesquioxane alcogels with dialkylsulfide, dialkyldisulfide, and dialkylpolysulfide bridging groups. These gels are prepared from bis (trialkoxysilyl) monomers which are dried by heating at ambient pressure over a period of days. Aerogels are synthetic, porous materials that are derived from gels. Due to its solid state but low density, it is an ultralight material that can be used as a thermal insulator, desiccant, or even as a means of providing a waterproof coating. Aerogels are used for a variety of purposes from thickening agents to makeup and paint. After discontinued use in the 1970s, efforts began to develop a non-toxic, safer aerogel that was less hazardous and flammable. Aerogels have wide commercial applications in everything from wetsuits, skylights, windows, paints, cosmetics to nuclear weapons. Currently, aerogels are dried by either using freeze or other supercritical methods. These methods are able to successfully dry the aerogels to their final state; however, there are some drawbacks.

    "published_date": "9/18/2019",
    "ip_description": "This technology surrounds the usage of plant extract microemulsions for the prevention of biofilm formation on food contact surfaces and medical devices. These microemulsions are non-toxic, plant-based, and are effective against known biofilm-forming pathogens such as Salmonella sp., E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. This invention presents a safe and natural way to prevent the formation of biofilms, thereby reducing the risk of contamination of ready-to-eat food products and potentially medical devices.\n\nThe term \u201cbiofilm\u201d refers to a colony of prokaryotic organisms that have aggregated together, forming a thick film with a protective layer of polysaccharide that is tightly adhered to a surface. Biofilms are particularly troublesome because when protected by the polysaccharide matrix, the bacteria inside can become up to 1,000 times more resistant to disinfectants than when suspended. As a result, biofilms can be difficult to remove once formed, and represent a source of contamination in both the food and medical device industries that can be very challenging to eliminate.\n\nBiofilms are a serious issue in both the medical device and food industries. In the early 2000s, 50-70% of hospital acquired infections manifesting between 2 and 30 days were implant-associated, representing 1-1.4 million cases. Treatment of biofilms in medical devices is very challenging as the above current techniques for removal, such as the use of disinfectants, cannot be used in humans, and antibiotics are often ineffective. Often, surgical replacement must take place if symptoms persist, which can be expensive and risky.\n\nIn the food industry, biofilms can cause outbreaks of disease if the food product becomes contaminated. Biofilms in food production and processing are usually chemically treated, with chlorine-based sanitizers being the most common. Hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and quaternary ammonium compounds are also often used.\n\nThe most effective treatment of biofilms is to prevent bacteria from attaching to the surface and initiating the formation of the biofilm. This invention can prevent biofilm formation, and is likely to be safe for use in both the food industry and medical devices.\n\nApplications:\n*   Biofilm prevention on food-contacting surfaces in food production and processing\n*   Biofilm prevention on medical devices\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Non-toxic (can be used in medical devices in the human body and in food)\n*   Natural and \u201cgreen\u201d appeal\n*   Easily-sourced components",

By creating a medical training system with a more life-like simulation, users can experience the inherent difficulties encountered in performing intubation and use the visual, tactile, and force feedback systems to improve their technique.\n\nAn endotracheal tube is placed when a patient is unable to breath on their own. It is also necessary to use when the patient needs to be sedated and \u201crest\u201d or protect the airway. These tubes are used on patients in a wide variety of environments. Also, the trachea varies in condition from patient to patient. Placement of the tracheal tube comes with complications, vomiting of patient, swelling of airway, and other conditions in which the doctor loses visibility of the trachea and causes impairment with placement of the tube. Due to these issues, there are short-term complications that may arise.

It can be utilized for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with potential application in other abnormal proliferative disorders such as cancer.\n\nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disorder affecting 1.1 to 17.6 million adults per year with a prevalence of 6.6 to 26 million. This progressive disorder is characterized by angioproliferative vasculopathy in the pulmonary arterioles leading to endothelial and smooth muscle proliferation, dysfunction, inflammation and thrombosis.\n\nThe pathology of the disorder is associated with the thickening/remodeling of the pulmonary artery wall. The Atk1 (Protein Kinase B) serine/threonine kinase pathway plays an important role in normal and pathological vascular development and functioning as well as in other cellular functions such as glucose metabolism, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration and transcription. Increased activation of the Atk1 signaling pathway is believed to play a role in PAH pathophysiology through inhibition of apoptotic signaling and promotion of cell survival.\n\nCurrently the disease remains incurable despite existing therapies which are largely ineffective. Patients are therefore limited to invasive heart-lung transplantation which is only available in limited surgical centers worldwide and which has only a 50% survival rate at 5 years. Thus, the present invention is a targeted peptide conjugated with an antioxidant, that acts as an inhibitor at the Atk1 nitration site associated with PAH pathological conditions.\n\nApplications:\n*   Targeted treatment for PAH and other proliferative disorders\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Significant need\n*   Few alternative effective therapies currently available\n*   Targeted selectivity for Atk1 nitration (i.e will not affect Atk1 phosphorylation and thus affect other physiological processes controlled by Atk1 signaling pathways)\n*   Potential for greater applications beyond PAH to also include other proliferative disorders",

    "ip_description": "This project proposes three improvements to a falloposcope under development. This falloposcope was designed with optical elements selected for detection of early stage ovarian cancer in fallopian tube epithelium. The data collected by the falloposcope is grounded in a growing body of medical research.\n\nFalloposcopes were used in the 1990s to treat infertility through cannulation of tubal occlusions. However, use waned because devices were fragile and required greater training to use. Plus, IVF was gaining popularity and generally the preferred method for treating infertility. Pregnancy rates from IVF and falloposcopic tuboplasty (FT) were similar though, and better quality images might improve the diagnosis of tubal patency (health of lumen and mucosa) which is a factor for understanding infertility.\n\nAlthough rare, ovarian cancer is often deadly because it is detected late. Pelvic ultrasounds and the CA-125 blood test are generally accurate for detecting late stage III-IV ovarian cancer, but the survival rates are less than 30%, compared with > 90% survival rates for cancer detected in early stages, I-II. Therefore, there is strong interest in developing better early detection screening procedures, particularly for high risk women with the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation. A reliable early detection procedure would provide an option other than removal of all reproductive organs after 40 for high risk women.\n\nResearch includes examining early stage lesions on the surface of ovaries and fallopian tube epithelium. Access to the fallopian tubes through the cervix is an attraction option because it does not involve surgery; instead, falloposcopic examination can be done in a clinic with mild sedation. However, to be effective, a falloposcope must be small enough to pass through the narrow 1mm opening from the uterus to the proximal portion of the fallopian tube but it must have sufficient resolution and field of view to image the 4cm wide fimbral portion of the tube approximately 10cm away.\n\nApplications:\n*   Falloposcopic tuboplasty\n*   Detection of early stage ovarian cancer\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Small diameter\n*   Sophisticated optics\n*   Able to collect variety of data",

    "ip_description": "This invention discloses a rate-adaptive forward error correction (FEC) scheme based on spatially-coupled (SC) LDPC codes derived from quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes with its field programmable gate array (FPGA) architecture. FPGA emulation demonstrates that the proposed LDPC codes provide larger coding gain and smaller error floor compared to the QC-LDPC base code with comparable computational complexity. The hardware friendly structure of the codes make them a promising candidate for the next-generation intelligent optical communication systems such as long-haul optical transmission system.\n\nLow-density parity check (LDPC) codes were discussed as early as 1962, in information theory research. The codes have encountered various performance barriers to speed and accuracy when decoding high volume of information, such as Shannon limit performance when information is decoded using a probabilistic algorithm, but continuing developments in new code construction, such as binary spatially-coupled codes based on Euclidean geometry have reduced errors compared with regular LDPC codes. As the speed requirement of modern optical communication systems keeps increasing, forward error correction (FEC) becomes an essential technique to enable high-speed transmission ranging from long-haul to access networks. LDPC codes have long strived for FEC from LDPC block code to the most recent spatially coupled (SC) LDPC code. SC-LDPC code approached asymptotic capacity as LDPC convolutional code (LDPC-CC) in 1999, and much research followed. Further analysis has shown that the decoding thresholds for the LDPC-CC codes are not only better than the belief propagation decoding thresholds of corresponding regular LDPC block codes, but also even very close to the maximum likelihood (ML) decoding thresholds.\n\nThis invention includes a simple method to construct a set of SC-LDPC codes with different code rates that is easily ported to hardware via an FPGA-ready configuration.",

As the capability of optical manufacturing has grown such that it is easy to mass produce optical components with non-symmetric surfaces, optical metrology \u2013 the process of measuring these surfaces \u2013 has also been forced to push in new directions to characterize complex optical surfaces. Various techniques have been used to measure large and small optical elements, from measuring local surface slopes in deflectometry to wavefront differences in interferometry and height differences in profilometry. However, measurement of steep slopes on optical surfaces remains a challenge for all methods and one that hinders fast, accurate measurement. Interferometers are commonly used to characterize optical surfaces. Interferometers compare wavefront properties from a surface being tested with wavefront properties from a reference source through an output called an interferogram. This image contains contrast fringes representing the combination of wavefronts that reveals differences between the test surface and reference beam. One way of measuring complex optical surfaces is to introduce a \u201cnull lens\u201d into the interferometer that acts to correct for deviations in the test surface such that the final interogram is a null image with no fringes. However, creating a physical null lens or a virtual null lens through computer generated holograms is a time-consuming process and one that must be repeated for each new surface under test. Therefore, it is desirable to find other approaches that act like a null lens without actually requiring a null lens. Applications include testing freeform optical surfaces with a short focal length, such as cell phone lens elements, projection elements and heads-up display.

The automated analysis calculates corrosion rates in an unambiguous and automatic way. It is less time-consuming and arbitrary than the conventional graphical analysis used currently. The data analysis is used in an automated test station which is currently being developed at the Water Energy Sustainable Technology (WEST) center in Tucson, Arizona. The data is of primary interest for converting electrochemical (I/V) data to corrosion rates (pipe metal loss rates). The crucial aspect of the invention is that it takes raw measured electrochemical current and voltage data and gives a metal loss rate and corrosion potential. Throughout the world, society is powered by often unseen pipes that transport water and other products through pipes. Because of the importance of such pipes, there is the constant need to ensure they are working properly. This helps to reduce costs and prevent destruction caused from leaks. Leaks themselves can often be caused by corrosion of pipes. This invention helps to address that problem. Applications include water companies, especially in Tucson and the rest of Arizona, where the technology has been tested; companies that sell corrosion prevention products and solutions; companies that treat corrosion in various piping projects; and potentially applicable to other projects that use extensive piping (i.e. oil and gas).

    "ip_description": "This technology is an extended depth of field (EDOF) system that maintains high lateral resolution while extending the depth of field. It is based on white light interferometry but adds a feature where the interferometer scans through the different depths of an object to create a depth map.\n\nWhite light interferometry offers a solution to the age-old trade-off in optics between depth of field and lateral field of view. Using white light interferometry, contrast fringes in interference images appear near zero optical path difference and best focus. By scanning through a range of height positions and integrating the resulting 3D data cube into a final 2D image, one can create a focused, full-color 2D object image. However, this process is both data collection and processing intensive. This project proposes a method to reduce both data collection time and the degree of post-processing needed to create a final focused image.\n\nThe relative phase between the signal and reference of the interferometer is not taken into account when examining the contrast fringes. The most accurate height measurements with height resolution on the order of 0.5 nanometers are from systems using best focus from contrast fringes and phase-shift data to correlate phase differences to surface height deltas. This project uses the contrast fringes for best focus measurements for height resolution on the order of microns.\n\nApplications:\n* Optical surface profilers (measurement tools using white light interferometry) are available from a number of optics companies, but data acquisition speeds are on the order of seconds. This project could reduce processing time to a fraction of a second.\n* Currently, interferometric methods are used for ophthalmology but interest is growing in the medical community for non-invasive detailed surface measurement techniques.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Leverages existing technology and improves efficiency\n* Faster data collection and less post-processing\n* Expand use of white light interferometry systems to industrial screening conditions requiring higher inspection rates",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a method of processing the interference fringes produced by the UA19-178 system. It employs a threshold-type operation at the incoherent light level so that only constructive interference is recorded, which greatly speeds up the data processing by reducing the amount of data to process in the first place. Processing occurs on the sensor to manipulate the raw signal into the desired form. The sensor\u2019s circuit elements transform the data from each pixel without sending the signal off-chip, thus avoiding the bottleneck effect that occurs from serially transferring the data.\n\nEvent-based vision sensors offer a radical departure from traditional synchronous (frame-based) sensors. Rather than collecting data from an array of pixels at set times, these sensors provide a stream of asynchronous events corresponding to a specified change at a particular pixel address. This means that vision sensors can respond to changes ten times faster than traditional video cameras running at 60 hz while providing data of interest rather than redundant or stale data. However, challenges remain to processing the asynchronous output stream and calibrating pixels\u2019 response within the extensive dynamic range of the sensor.\n\nThreshold processing refers to the circuitry that processes the detectable signals from photo-sensitive elements and converts the signals to digital output that is interpreted by downstream algorithms. Concerns of precision and noise guide choice of circuit design, as well as cost.\n\nApplications: Circuit modifications proposed in this project are tailored for applications involving white light interferometry imagers because they consider the specific computations useful to capturing depth of field and intensity data.\n\nAdvantages: The chief advantage of this modification would be processing speed in systems using white light interferometry imagers.",

Data compression algorithms, such as a zip file, reduce the number of bits needed to store or transmit digital information. The performance of the algorithms is often quantified in terms of a compression ratio. For example, 80% means that the compressed data would use 80% fewer bits than the original. The highest performance algorithms, such as those used to compress video for consumer applications (i.e. an mp4 video file) are \u201clossy,\u201d which means that the information is discarded when it is judged to be not important to the presentation quality of the video. In many cases, in scientific applications such as astronomy, loss of information is unacceptable to the end product. Lossy algorithms typically do very well in both compression and decompression times, although they are optimized for decompression (i.e. playback). However, lossless algorithms, like the zip algorithm, are often very slow in both directions.

The device itself is a series of balloons used to gradually decrease the space in the stomach to promote weight loss. Unlike current gastric balloon based interventions that are free-floating and meant to only be utilized in the short term, this technology can be attached to the abdominal wall and can be utilized for long term, sustained weight loss. The technology works to decrease the space in the stomach by increasing the volume in the balloons. This volume adjustment can be done by the physician but also can be controlled by the patient themselves. While surgery is required to place the balloon, the procedure can potentially be performed endoscopically or by an interventional radiologist allowing for lighter anesthesia. The device is not permanent and can be removed. There are many different approaches used to address obesity depending on the individual patient and severity. Morbidly obese patients are potential candidates for various surgical options which are beneficial. However, these procedures are invasive and permanently alter the patient\u2019s anatomy. Gastric balloon placements are considered an alternative to these invasive surgeries for lower BMI patients but most gastric balloon devices run the risk of deflation which can cause an obstruction because the balloons are free floating within the stomach.

This approach has the potential to obtain measurements from a much smaller package that consume less power than standard optical gyroscopes and offers different integration options than larger designs. Another challenge has been how to reduce lock-in effects (higher noise and drift) for low rotation rates and achieve accurate performance without high power consumption from multiple laser sources. Innovations in optical devices have shrunk many functions to photonics scales on the order or tens or hundreds of microns, but so far performance from optical gyroscopes on these scales has not achieved desired levels.

Necroptosis is form of cell death which is activated by inflammation.\n\nFinding disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) and related dementias is critical. The prevalence of dementia is rising rapidly with over 50 million people afflicted world-wide and is anticipated to grow to 82 million by 2030.

    "ip_description": "University of Arizona researchers have developed a drug composition and method of cancer treatment using chemotherapeutics linked to ligands selective for uptake by melanocortin 1 receptors (MC1R) in MC1R-overexpressing melanoma. This development targets melanoma, and may be used with a wide range of cytotoxic drugs, to selectively deliver a toxic payload that may be less likely to result in melanoma treatment resistance and off-target effects of systemic exposure.\n\nMelanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer in the United States, with an estimated 87,110 new cases and 9,730 deaths in 2017. Once metastasized, the median overall survival for malignant melanoma patients is 5.3 months. Despite recent breakthroughs for developing BRAF-V600E and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, current treatments can only improve survival, and tumor cells eventually become resistant to these treatments. The BRAF-V600E inhibitor vemurafenib was shown to prolong the median overall survival of patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma to 15.9 months. However, a mice study showed that 20% of melanoma tumors became resistant to vemurafenib treatment after 56 days. Similarly, 60% to 70% of metastatic melanoma patients are innately resistant to PD-1 inhibitor treatments. To increase response rate and avoid the resistance issue, there is a need for melanoma drugs that can target biological processes that are fundamental for cell proliferation or survival, so that the therapeutic effect cannot be easily bypassed through activation of a compensating signal pathway. Nevertheless, current anticancer agents that target cell proliferation or survival usually have poor selectivity to cancer cells and thus are also toxic to healthy non-cancer cells.\n\nApplications:\n*   Melanoma therapy\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Higher selectivity\n*   Fewer side effects\n*   Circumvents drug resistance in tumor cells",

Freeform optics provide many possibilities in the design of cutting-edge optical systems. However, their fabrication and metrology are challenging. To verify the freeform shape, two non-contact optical metrology methods are commonly used for UUT, interferometry and deflectometry. Interferometry offers high accuracy and precision in surface metrology. However, this method relies on prohibitively expensive computer-generated holograms and requires a null setup to obtain accurate results. Deflectometry is an alternative non-null test method that relies on rays leaving a source, being deflected by a UUT. Convex optics both standard and freeform are highly challenging to measure. Interferometric approaches typically require measuring sub-apertures that are then stitched together. The required setup is not always a viable option. Deflectometry is used in 3D construction for surfaces up to weak convex surfaces; however; a full aperture optical precision test of general convex surfaces is yet to be achieved.

Ku70/80 is a protein that repairs radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), causing the cancer treatment process to be prolonged.

This approach uses a spatial light modulator (SLM) to form a wavefront to correct for wavelength shift induced aberrations in volume holographic focusing elements. Volume holographic optical elements show great potential for use in constrained applications like augmented and virtual reality eyewear since they can be realized with high diffraction efficiency in thin film materials. However, one of the problems with volume holographic materials is that they are only sensitive at shorter wavelengths (i.e. less than 650 nm) while many applications require operation at longer near IR wavelengths. When a focusing type holographic element is formed at one wavelength and reconstructed at a different wavelength, aberrations in the reconstructed image result from an inability to match the phase and Bragg conditions across the aperture of the hologram. Several methods have been proposed to correct this problem, although none completely successful. This invention proposes an alternative approach to solving this problem. Applications include constrained applications like augmented and virtual reality eyewear. Advantages include reduced aberrations in reconstructed image, precise determination of aberrations through Bragg matching rays at the reconstruction wavelength geometry, and meeting the need for applications that require operation at longer near IR wavelengths.",

    "ip_description": "This invention is a system and method used for optically positioning and linking colloidal nanoparticles using an optical tweezer. This invention allows for precise positioning and chemical coatings for linking. It is similar to a 3D printer in that it is capable of nanoscale 3D printing of objects and structures that are made of several different materials but has a much finer resolution than existing 3D printing techniques. The invention combines several tools and methods in a novel way to achieve its capability. The capability of the system to 3D print heterogeneous nanostructures is beyond any nanoscale 3D printers currently on the market. Nanotechnology is a field of science and technology that manufactures, uses, or measures structures that have some dimensions that are less than 100 nanometers in length. Nanotechnology has recently seen an enormous amount of interest and advancement (some have even called it \u201cthe Industrial Revolution of the twenty-first century\u201d) due to its broad range of applications across many other disciplines and fields. Some of these possibilities include medicine, energy, robotics, manufacturing, and optics. However, prototyping for research and development requires a lot of resources and it can be very expensive and time consuming with many steps involved. 3D printing has become popular in larger scale manufacturing prototyping due to its relatively high turnaround rates and lower costs of machinery. For these reasons, 3D printing on the nanoscale has also become a topic of interest in developing nanotechnology. The limitations to the current state of art nanoscale 3D printers are resolution sizes and being able to print with only one medium (usually a very specific type of material, such as photo-resins). The invention addresses these concerns of current nano-3D printing methods by using a system in which multiple materials (ranging from plastics to metals to biological materials) can all be used in a single print, with very high resolution. The implications of this invention would be that researchers and scientists, or even smaller size businesses would be able to prototype nanotechnology at much lower costs and higher speed than current methods of creating heterogeneous nanostructures.",

A pro-drug is released within the colon to release the active ingredient. The method will allow for targeted delivery of 5-fluorouracil to the colon. Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. Patients with colorectal cancer often receive chemotherapy as a primary treatment or as a pre/post-surgery treatment for their cancer. One of the most commonly used chemotherapy drugs used in the treatment of colorectal cancer is 5-Fluorouracil. 5-Fluorouracil is used due to its high effectiveness rates against colorectal cancer. Current oral administrations of pro-drugs for 5-Fluorouracil, capecitabine and tegafur, must be metabolized in the liver before 5-FU can be released, thus, the drug is not concentrated in the colon, but rather is systematically available. This leads to adverse effects which might be avoided if 5-FU was specifically released in the colon and remained concentrated there. Therefore, there is a need for a method that allows release of 5-FU or other active pharmaceutical ingredients in the colon. Applications include colorectal cancer treatment.

    "ip_description": "Novel molecular design extends the reach of iron chelators to applications in cancer chemotherapy. This invention not only recognizes the higher demand of iron that characterizes cancer cells, but also takes into account other physiological differences between malignant cells and the surrounding tissue. Specifically, pro-drugs are designed to activate into iron chelating agents within the reducing environment of the cytoplasm of cancer cells.\n\nBasic and clinical research has improved significantly the prognosis and number of treatment options for cancer patients in the past decades. Broad-spectrum cytotoxins and their unwanted side effects, however, continue to be part of cancer chemotherapy in the clinical practice. Current research efforts are responding to the pressing need for more targeted, less toxic treatment options. Such approaches are necessarily based on new or previously overlooked information on the genetic and/or metabolic makeup of cancer cells, particularly on peculiarities that differentiate them from normal cells within the same tissue. We pursue the molecular design of strategies to study and exploit an aspect of cancer metabolism that is not targeted by current clinical chemotherapy, namely the altered iron metabolism of malignant cells.\n\nIn order to sustain their rapid proliferation rates, cancer cells require higher iron content when compared to normal cells. As such, the use of small-molecule scavengers (chelators) of iron ions could deprive cancer cells of this essential supply, thereby slowing or halting cancer growth. Indeed, chelation therapy has been employed clinically for decades in cases of iron overload conditions associated with genetic disorders, such as thalassemia and hemochromatosis. The key to the success of chelation therapy in cancer treatment, however, is the ability to target iron ions in malignant cells without affecting iron levels in the bloodstream and in normal tissue. Lacking such selectivity, currently available chelators were found to elicit adverse side effects when employed in the context of cancer research.",

The World Health Organization estimates that 234.2 million surgical procedures are performed every year worldwide, with around 50 million of those procedures happening within the United States during recorded years. One of the main problems that is faced during surgery is blood loss of the patient. When a patient loses too much blood during surgery, it can result in permanent organ damage or even organ failure.

The method in which these compounds have been derived allows for HSP70 isoform specificity. Many HSP70 targeted drugs have been unsuccessful due to the variety of HSP70 isoforms, and lack of specificity to a particular isoform. Cancer cells have an increased burden on protein quality control machinery due to their rapid growth rates and the required transforming mutations that can produce unstable proteins. This increased need has led to the development of drugs targeting protein quality control pathways. HSP70s in concert with their co-factors HSP40s (J-Proteins) and nucleotide exchange factor (NEFs), use ATP binding and hydrolysis to catch and release unfolded polypeptides to prevent aggregation and give them the chance to reach their native, functional state. Many cancers have increased levels of a given HSP70 isoform, leading to increased survival and chemoresistance, making HSP70s potential drug targets. Concerns for HSP70s drugability have been raised because of the difficulties with isoform specificity, there are 13 HSP70 isoforms described in humans.

It uses unwrapping algorithms based on a transport of an intensity equation with a convolutional neural network to unwrap the phase. This novel method uses a multi-class classification process and introduces an efficient segmentation network to identify classes. This allows for a more efficient and effective method in removing the ambiguity that occurs in a wrapped phase.\n\nSystems that use modern and mature algorithms to extract phase signals tend to return phases that involve phase jumps that produce inherently wrapped outputs that result in unusable phases. These unusable phases require the phase discontinuities to be removed by a phase unwrapping algorithm.\n\nWhile there are many types of technology that involve and require the extraction of a phase signal from an input image, such phase unwrapping is a time-consuming process that makes it challenging for there not to be any errors when it is produced. Depending on the outcome of the process, the entire system can be affected. The outcome can involve thousands of individual phase wraps, false phase wraps caused by noise, or by the phase extraction algorithm itself. Differentiating between these is a complicated process and the errors can be spread throughout the entire image leaving the resulting image unusable.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed systems and methods for estimating gamma ray positions that are faster, more accurate, and more computationally and memory-use efficient than known systems and methods used in the medical imaging field. Scintillator-based detectors have been extensively used in both clinical and pre-clinical SPECT and PET scanners, due to their relatively low cost, high gamma-ray stopping power and fast timing. Position-estimation algorithms or decoding methods are applied for gamma-ray interaction position localization with signals induced by scintillation photons on light sensors (PMTs, SiPMs, etc.). Many gamma-ray position estimation/decoding algorithms based on reference datasets have been proposed because they provide better positioning capability for gamma-ray interactions especially at detector edges and corners, and also filter out events that Compton scatter and deposit energy in multiple positions in the detector. But reference-data-based methods need detector calibration to acquire their reference datasets, and the position estimation speed remains relatively slow due to the excessive computations required. Thus, the current need for position estimation is for both high levels of accuracy and efficiency. Advantages: Faster, More accurate position estimation, Can be used with detectors with complicated mean-detector-response functions. Applications: Gamma ray imaging, Other medical imaging.",

    "published_date": "6/9/2021",
    "ip_description": "Inventors at the University of Arizona have developed oxytocin analogues which have high potency, are designed to be more stable compared to the native oxytocin hormone (an endogenous peptide which inhibits pain and promotes social connection), have very high selectivity for oxytocin receptors, and are bioavailable for brain therapeutics. These druggable compounds may be further developed for use as non-opioid pain relief, social anxiety, anti-addiction, or post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nOpioid drugs like morphine and Oxycontin\u00ae are considered to be the gold standard for managing moderate-to-severe pain, and are often used to treat chronic pain as well. Unfortunately, these drugs are plagued with undesired side effects, particularly respiratory depression, GI effects, euphoria and sedation, and the use of these drugs can lead to opioid use disorder (OUD) and fatal overdose. Prescription rates and subsequent addiction, abuse, and hospital admissions for overdose have soared in the past 20 years for opioid drugs, with fentanyl-related abuse and overdose in particular skyrocketing since 2012. Many strategies have been developed to generate efficacious opioids with reduced addiction potential, such as biased ligands, multifunctional ligands, or endogenous peptide derivatives, but none have yet been translated to clinical use. This unsolved limitation of opioids illustrates the great medical need for effective alternative non-opioid analgesics.\n\nAn alternate pain modulatory system of great interest is the oxytocin (OT) neuronal network. Extensive research to date has shown that OT modulates pain. Importantly, OT has been shown to inhibit nociceptive pathways in peripheral nerve terminals, in the spinal cord, and in diverse brain pain regulatory systems including the periaqueductal grey, the amygdala, and the anterior cingulate cortex. This pattern is similar to the opioid system, thus explaining the efficacy of OT in modulating pain. Interestingly, modulation of oxytocin receptor (\u201cOXTR\u201d) using an OXTR agonist does not induce the side effects typical of opioid agonists. Opioid receptors and OXTR are neuropeptide receptors, thus given their activities, it is believed that OT can also be used to treat opioid addiction. Furthermore, based on its activity it is believed that OXTR agonists can also be used as non-opioid analgesics. Unfortunately, however, due to the instability of the native disulfide linkage, OT is unsuitable for use as a drug. Moreover, OT cannot readily cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), so it is generally not well suited for use as a pharmaceutical. Recently, intranasal delivery of native OT has been reported. However, this intranasal delivery method misses important sites of OT action in the spinal cord and periphery. While small molecule OXTR ligands have been developed, they have yet to advance to the clinic.",

    "ip_description": "This innovation is research involving the development of aptamers that work to neutralize antibodies which harm the myelin sheath of nerves. The innovation can be a successful treatment for both multiple sclerosis (MS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIPD). These aptamers will be very specific to block certain autoantibodies and can be designed to have specific aptamer panels for each patient depending on what autoantibodies they have. The current treatments for these auto-immune diseases are non-specific and only treat the symptoms, not the underlying problems of the symptoms. The technology has the potential to provide a personalized approach for patients by neutralizing one of the pathologic components of the autoimmune reaction that causes demyelination. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease which affects millions of people worldwide. The disease is one of many which affects the central nervous system and is currently without a cure. Without a cure, medical research focuses on treatment for MS and trying to make life more manageable for those suffering from the debilitating disease. Aptamers are small single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotide fragments or small peptides, which can bind to targets. One of the problems with MS treatment is antibodies attacking the myelin sheath of the body\u2019s nerves. With the amount of money that people spend every year on multiple sclerosis treatment, there is a need for a development of a treatment which gives patients the life they deserve. Applications: To offer more specific, patient oriented, treatment of demyelinating diseases not currently available with traditional medication, including: Treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) to counteract problems associated with traditional treatments, To treat chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIPD) and help protect patients. Advantages: Allows for the mitigation of pathology while minimizing side effects, Is different than many of the traditional treatments for Multiple Sclerosis, Developed at a University with a large medical school which could serve as an advantage in research, testing, and implementation.",

These compounds have the potential to treat a wide variety of diseases including prostate cancer. In particular, these compounds are aimed at helping individuals who have developed a resistance to androgen-deprivation therapies (ADT). While most ADT therapeutics utilize androgen receptor (AR) antagonists or androgen synthesis inhibitors, this technology utilizes specific compounds that work to reduce AR expression, which could potentially help ADT-resistant patients by decreasing overall resistance to begin with.\n\nAdditional experiments have also demonstrated that these compounds also display significant anti-herpes simplex virus type 1 (anti-HSV-1) activity.\n\nLong-term prostate cancer control is currently done through the use of ADT. Unfortunately, ADT can ultimately lead to resistance to this therapy, which quickly progresses in to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). There are no solutions for individuals who develop a resistance to ADT, and with no solutions, individuals struggle with the ability to maintain the treatment of their cancer.

These biomarkers are based on leukocyte RNA expression so the prognosis can be easily done by a blood draw instead of a brain biopsy.\n\nBackground: Drug resistant epilepsy patients are unable to live a standard quality of life as seizures are untreatable with drugs. Candidates for surgery are patients who fail adequate trials of at least two first line medicines and one combination of at least two drugs. SLAH provides a less invasive procedure with favorable seizure-free or seizure reduction for drug resistant epilepsy patients. Approximately 2/3 of patients that go through craniotomy involving procedures, such as Amygdalohippocampotomy (AH), obtain seizure free status. Meanwhile an approximate 77% of patients that go through SLAH obtain significant seizure reductions (54% obtaining seizure free status). Due to the high numbers of patients that may be unresponsive to surgical interventions, it is critical to implement a prediction analysis technology to reduce expenses to both patients and healthcare providers that result from unnecessary treatment. Furthermore, patients can avoid serious consequences like verbal and visual memory loss from performing a surgery they wouldn't respond to.\n\nApplications:\n* Genetic biomarkers\n* Prognosis for seizure free outcome after surgery for epilepsy patients\n\nAdvantages:\n* Reduces significant costs involved with surgery\n* The prognosis can be done on blood cells instead of brain biopsy\n* Provides the potential to avoid unnecessary procedures in patients who will not benefit from SLAH",

    "ip_description": "This invention relates to methods of preventing or treating age-related diseases comprising targeting the kynurenine pathway by blocking, reducing expression, or reducing activity of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid dioxygenase (HAAO), and or increasing the bioavailability of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HAA). Human diseases are characterized by upregulation of different combinations of stress and/or dysregulation of stress response pathways. For example, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by elevated oxidative stress, increased inflammation, and an increase burden of misfolded and aggregated proteins, while cancer is characterized by increased burden of DNA damage, impaired DNA repair, elevated oxidative stress, and localized hypoxia. The kynurenine pathway (KP), the primary route for tryptophan catabolism, is a metabolic pathway that interacts with inflammation. Dysregulation of the KP increases with age and is linked to diseases of aging such as neurodegeneration, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and chronic inflammation. Multiple interventions that target KP enzymes or metabolites have potential to slow decline with age and improve outcomes of various age-associated illnesses. Applications include Alzheimer's treatment, age-related diseases, and anti-inflammation. Advantages include reducing inflammation, reducing oxidative stress, and allowing earlier intervention for chronic, age-related diseases.",

It is designed in such a way that it can filter plastics smaller than 5mm in size while returning nutrients, like plankton, back to the ocean. Every year up to 8,00,000 metric tons of plastic enters our planet's oceans where it collects in circulating currents, known as gyres, or is carried to beaches. While floating, the plastic pieces break down from environmental factors like the sun and animals into smaller and smaller pieces, some of which measure a fraction of a millimeter. These pieces are then small enough to enter the food chain where they can eventually be found in the seafood we consume. When consumed, the plastic can cause deformities in DNA and can lead to illnesses like cancer. Floating plastic also contributes to oceanic dead zones, areas that lack life because oxygen or food is being affected by something in the system. Removing plastic from the ocean has become critical to its health and the survival of the animals that live in and around it. Applications include removal of plastic from water systems and oceanic and environmental studies. Advantages include allowing microscopic organisms to return to the water, capability of removing plastic particles smaller than 5mm in size, and being low cost.",

This invention allows for faster curing rates using high and controlled concentrations of initiators. The invention also improves upon currently available resins, as this invention reduces the chances of resin chemical leaching and solves plasticization issues. It provides for a more durable and safer product. The current composition of the photo-curable resin used in practice today are composed of mixtures of acrylate or methacrylate monomers and comonomers which have multiple cross-linked groups. These mixtures permit an application that does not need to use a solvent but then creates pores or results in shrinkage, drying stress and cracking. This also causes plasticization and chemical leaching from the resin. This invention solves this problem by providing a new type of photo-curable resin that eliminates plasticization and makes leaching improbable. Applications include dental materials, photocured adhesives, and 3D stereolithographic printing. Advantages include being a single oligomeric, no solvent needed, permitting high and controlled concentrations of initiators, faster curing rates compared to conventional resins, eliminating plasticization issues that occur with current resins, and reducing the likeliness of chemical leaching.",
