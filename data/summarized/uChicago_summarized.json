    "ip_description": "Polymersomes are a type of nanoscale vesicle made from block copolymers and can encapsulate a variety of therapeutic agents including proteins and nucleic acids. These nanovesicles are assembled at room temperature and incorporate features such as permanently charged moieties for stability and mannosylation for targeted delivery. The Unmet Need: A versatile platform that can deliver both RNA and protein payloads in vivo. Advancements in nanomedicine have allowed researchers to develop biomacromolecular therapies more efficiently and with greater precision, both considering small-interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy, messenger RNA (mRNA) therapies including vaccines, and protein therapies including vaccines and inverse vaccines. However, effective payload protection and delivery are key requirements, as these macromolecules are highly sensitive to clearance and degradation when administered in vivo. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology has successfully demonstrated intravenous delivery of siRNA for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis in the liver using the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. However, issues with storage stability and complex processing limit access to these novel therapies and necessitates improvements in formulation. Furthermore, LNPs are highly specialized for nucleic acid delivery, and therefore no formulations exist for protein payloads, e.g., use as subunit vaccines. Polymer nanoparticles have long been considered a key alternative to LNPs as the macromolecular nature of their substituents impart greater stability and tunability. Their synthetic versatility is particularly attractive for achieving delivery of a wide range of payloads such as proteins, small molecules and nucleic acids, namely mRNA and siRNA. By broadening the type of possible payloads that can be delivered in particulate formulations, a single encapsulation technology could be applicable in a variety of treatments, such as vaccination, tolerization, RNAi therapy, and cancer treatment. The Proposed Solution: A polymersome platform that addresses several challenges to broad translation of biologic nanoparticle delivery, including scalability, loading efficiency, quality control, and dry storage. The faculty inventor developed a novel, highly efficient approach to forming 100 nm vesicular polymer nanoparticles (polymersomes) that requires no organic solvents. As the solution is raised to room temperature, thermally responsive block copolymers self-assemble in aqueous media from unimers. This is possible by using block copolymers with a domain that has a lower critical solution temperature such that they are soluble in aqueous medium under standard refrigeration (4-7\u00b0C) temperature, but assemble upon warming to room temperature. The result is large batches of nanoparticles with predictable size and morphology as dictated by polymer structure. The nanomaterials are designed with charged and biofunctional moieties to drive payload affinity as well as in-vivo targeting, respectively. Both siRNA and protein payloads can be incorporated during warming at higher than 75% loading efficiencies. The system is capable of in-vivo delivery in the contexts of protein subunit vaccination, prophylactic immune tolerance induction, and siRNA interference therapy in cancer. Payload-polymer suspensions can also be lyophilized into a dry state, allowing for greater hydrolytic stability under mild (4-7\u00b0C) refrigeration conditions, greatly reducing processing and storage requirements.",

    "ip_description": "The field of oncological diagnostics and therapeutics has long sought methods to refine treatment approaches for aggressive cancers. In conditions such as advanced high-grade ovarian cancer, there is a critical need for techniques that can accurately predict therapeutic responses and guide personalized treatment decisions. This is driven by the limitations of conventional treatments which often employ blanket strategies that may not account for the molecular diversity of tumors. The absence of reliable predictive indicators for chemotherapy efficacy and tailored immunotherapies underscores the urgency for advanced diagnostic and treatment tools. Current approaches are hampered by a lack of specificity and sensitivity in identifying those patients who will benefit from existing therapies. Standard chemotherapeutic regimens can result in significant toxicities without guaranteeing improved outcomes, and the heterogeneity of tumor cell populations further complicates effective patient stratification. Additionally, conventional methods do not adequately address the propensity of tumors to develop resistance to treatment. These challenges have created a pressing need for innovative strategies that can detect subtle biomarkers indicative of drug response, paving the way for more targeted and efficacious therapeutic interventions. The faculty inventor leveraged CT45A family proteins as a biomarker to predict carboplatin sensitivity, while also serving as a target for T-cell\u2013based therapies in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. It features the ability to induce CT45A expression in tumors initially lacking it by using DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.

    "ip_description": "The Unmet Need: Front-line disease modifying therapies for ALS and FTD\n\nThe prevalence of ALS is increasing at a steady rate in line with population growth and despite the availability of several marketed drugs, all of them lack efficacy and only succeed in prolonging life by a moderate margin. Glutamate antagonists (riluzole) are used as the front-line backbone therapy but only provide a six-month improvement in prolonging a patient's life. Free radical scavengers are used typically as an add-on therapy and have only marginal additional survival impact. Therefore, there is need for other drug classes with better symptom control and life prolonging benefits.\n\nThere is a significant unmet need for treatment options that are disease modifying, targeting the underlying cause of ALS to halt/reverse or cure the disease rather than focusing on symptomatic improvement. In the current treatment algorithm, there is only one approved disease modifying therapy, Biogen\u2019s Qalsody, an ASO proposing a curative approach.\n\nSeen as the first complex biologic to enter the ALS market, Qalsody (tofersen sodium) in early 2023 became the first ASO to receive FDA approval to treat adults with SOD1 mediated ALS. However, ALS patients with SOD1 protein mutation only make up only 3% of total ALS patients.\n\nThe Proposed Solution: Targeted and precise ASO approach to treating ALS and FTD that reduces the toxic gain of function caused by the repeat expansion mutation in the C9ORF72 gene\n\nThe faculty inventor developed a novel ASO to target the antisense transcripts containing repeating CCCCGG sequences in the C9ORF72 gene, which is the most common monogenic cause of inherited ALS and FTD. This mutation is predicted to cause ALS/FTD via three non-mutually exclusive mechanisms: (1) a loss-of-function mechanism due to reduced C9ORF72 protein expression, (2) a gain-of-function mechanism due to toxicity from repeat-containing sense (GGGGCC) and antisense (CCCCGG) RNA, and (3) toxicity from dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins produced from these transcripts.\nThis ASO strategy provides a novel mechanism to reduce the toxic gain of function caused by the repeat expansion mutation in the C9ORF72 gene.

    "published_date": "12/5/2024",
    "ip_description": "The invention introduces a method for fabricating low-loss niobium Josephson junctions which enhance quantum device performance by using niobium superconductors that are separated by an aluminum oxide barrier and are encapsulated with aluminum layers to prevent chemical diffusion and minimize loss. Superconducting Josephson junctions, formed by two primary superconductors separated by a thin (< 2 nm thick) barrier, have enabled a wide range of possibilities from superconducting logic circuits to quantum sensing, quantum computation, and the exploration of emergent phenomena in quantum circuits. While the original Josephson junction technologies relied on higher temperature superconductors, such as lead or niobium, the demonstration of low-loss aluminum junctions led to their widespread adoption for sensitive quantum circuitry, where it is crucial to minimize sources of decoherence. Due to the lower superconducting critical current, however, modern aluminum Josephson junction-based quantum circuits are still limited to operation at extremely low temperatures (< 0.1 Kelvin) and lower frequencies (< 70 GHz). There are numerous publications and patents detailing various fabrication methods of niobium Josephson junctions, but these processes typically target larger junctions for use in superconducting integrated circuits, metrology, or single-flux-quantum logic, rather than low-loss quantum circuits. Many of these methods rely on anodization or the presence of an insulating structure embedded in the final product, which are known channels for dielectric loss. Additionally, methods involving a variety of primary superconductors (e.g., NbN) and barriers (e.g., Nb-Ox, AlN) often result in at least one primary superconductor making direct contact with the barrier, which may lead to chemical diffusion and the emergence of losses near the barrier. These limitations of current technology underscore the need for improved methods that minimize loss and decoherence in Josephson junctions for higher temperature and higher frequency quantum devices. The disclosed fabrication method for low-loss niobium Josephson junctions aims to enhance quantum device performance. These junctions enhance quantum device performance by using niobium superconductors separated by an aluminum oxide barrier. The barrier is encapsulated by thin aluminum layers to prevent chemical diffusion. The fabrication process involves vertical material stacking in a vacuum, patterning with plasma reactive ion etching, and silicon dielectric growth. A second niobium layer is added, patterned, and chemically treated to remove residual dielectric material, achieving low-loss comparable to modern aluminum junctions. Additionally, the junction current density can be tuned through annealing, providing flexibility in device parameters. This technology is differentiated by its ability to significantly reduce loss and decoherence in niobium Josephson junctions, bringing their performance closer to that of aluminum-based junctions. The key improvement lies in the encapsulation of the aluminum oxide barrier with aluminum layers, which isolates the barrier chemically from the niobium and prevents diffusion-related losses. The use of the self-aligned side-wall passivation spacer method minimizes dielectric material in the wiring layer, further reducing potential sources of decoherence. The vertical growth process in a vacuum ensures a clean substrate, and optimized plasma RIE patterning reduces contamination. The ability to tune the junction current density through annealing offers a wider range of operational parameters, making this technology adaptable to various quantum device requirements. This approach opens the door for higher temperature and higher frequency superconducting quantum devices, setting it apart from traditional junction fabrication methods.",

For example, synthetic oligonucleotides have been used to modulate RNA splicing (i.e. splice switching) or reduce mRNA expression levels by nucleating RNAi pathways along with a host of other applications.\n*   Recently, the recruitment of Adenosine Deaminases that Act on RNAs (ADARs) to direct site-specific editing of RNA has garnered interest as a potential therapeutic modality. ADARs catalyze the conversion of Adenosine (A) to Inosine (I), a biological mimic for Guanosine (G) during translation and other cellular processes. Base recoding by ADARs can be used to correct G-to-A mutations, modulate protein function, or regulate protein splicing and expression when directed to introns within pre-mRNAs or untranslated regions (UTRs) in mature mRNAs.\n*   A major challenge confronting the clinical application of site-directed RNA editing (SDRE) is the design of small guide RNAs (gRNAs) that can drive efficient editing. Although many gRNA designs have effectively recruited endogenous ADARs, most of them exceed the size of currently FDA-approved antisense oligos.

RNA delivery is a rapidly evolving area within the broader domain of drug delivery systems. mRNA therapeutics have garnered significant interest due to their potential to instruct cells to produce specific proteins that can combat a wide range of diseases. Unlike traditional drugs, which typically involve administering therapeutic proteins directly, mRNA therapies leverage the body's cellular machinery to produce these proteins endogenously, offering a versatile approach to treatment. Current technologies for delivering mRNA include various vectors such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), viral vectors, and polymers. These technologies have demonstrated functionality in delivering mRNA vaccines and therapeutics systemically via injections. Also, these delivery techniques are limited by potential safety concerns including immunogenicity, stability, and efficiency of delivery.

The Unmet Need: Methods to increase CAR T efficacy and reduce exhaustion. Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR T cells) have revolutionized the field of immunotherapy, showing significant promise in treating certain types of blood cancers, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). These engineered T-cells are designed to target and kill cancer cells more effectively than conventional treatments. Despite their effectiveness, a substantial need exists for improving the persistence and cytotoxic capabilities of CAR T cells to enhance patient outcomes. This has led to a surge in research focusing on genetic and drug-based modifications to sustain the anti-tumor activity of CAR T cells. Current approaches to enhancing CAR T cell efficacy, although promising, face significant challenges. One major issue is the potential for T-cell exhaustion, a state where T-cells lose their ability to function effectively, which compromises their long-term efficacy. Additionally, existing strategies do not adequately address the intrinsic apoptotic pathways, which play a critical role in the regulation of immune cell survival and function. Without targeted intervention in these pathways, enhancing CAR T cell function remains limited, making it imperative to explore novel strategies to overcome these barriers, improve the genetic landscape, and optimize the anti-tumor efficacy of CAR T cells in clinical settings. The Proposed Solution: Novel combination therapy with venetoclax amplifying CAR T-cell antigen-specific antitumor activity and prolonged function. The faculty inventor developed methods to expand human anti-CD19 CAR T cells using venetoclax, a small-molecule BCL-2-specific BH3 mimetic. This expansion results in enhanced antigen-specific cytolytic capabilities of CAR T cells in vitro and increased effectiveness against CD19+ diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in pre-clinical animal models. Additionally, treatment with venetoclax alters the genetic landscape of the CAR T cells, increasing both BCL-2 protein and mRNA expression, which is suggestive of reduced cell exhaustion and modified metabolism. Importantly, the cytolytic effects are observed in CAR T cells using costimulatory domains, which are commonly employed in commercial CAR T cell therapies. This approach leverages the intrinsic apoptotic pathway to amplify CAR T cell efficacy, a novel approach not previously explored. The introduction of drug-based interventions like venetoclax to modulate BCL-2 expression presents a significant improvement over existing CAR T cell therapies, as it directly addresses T cell exhaustion and metabolic changes, potentially resulting in superior patient outcomes for those with CD19+ lymphomas.",

However, the limited packaging capacity of AAV vectors (4.7 kb) poses a significant challenge for delivering larger CRISPR systems like SpCas9 (1,368 amino acids) or AsCas12a (1,307 amino acids) along with their necessary components. This limitation has spurred interest in compact CRISPR-Cas systems, particularly Cas12f proteins, which are significantly smaller. While promising, existing compact CRISPR-Cas systems, including Cas12f, often exhibit modest gene-editing activity compared to their larger counterparts. This reduced activity limits their therapeutic efficacy and necessitates further development to achieve robust and reliable gene editing for clinical applications. The proposed solution: Potent and versatile engineered hypercompact enAsCas12f with enhanced gene-editing efficiency. The faculty inventor developed enAsCas12f, an engineered CRISPR-Cas12f system designed for enhanced gene editing in-human cells. This system boasts significantly higher potency, up to 11.3 times, compared to its predecessor, AsCas12f. It is remarkably compact, approximately one-third the size of the widely used SpCas9, making it ideal for delivery via adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) that have limited packaging capacity. enAsCas12f achieves impressive insertion and deletion rates of up to 69.8% at targeted genomic locations while exhibiting minimal off-target effects, ensuring high specificity.",

The Unmet Need: Novel effector proteins for programmed RNA editing. RNA editing has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing genetic diseases. Unlike DNA editing, which permanently alters the genome, RNA editing offers a reversible and dose-dependent approach to modify cellular behavior by targeting RNA transcripts. This flexibility is particularly valuable for diseases requiring precise editing levels or treatments within specific time windows. The potential of RNA editing to treat genetic diseases stems from its ability to correct genetic defects at the RNA level, avoiding permanent modifications to the genome. Current RNA editing approaches primarily rely on the ADAR family of enzymes, which act on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). However, these ADAR-based methods face limitations. Firstly, the reliance on endogenous ADARs poses a challenge due to their low expression in most adult tissues and their predominant nuclear localization, hindering efficient editing in the cytoplasm. Secondly, the broad target range of ADARs raises concerns about off-target editing, potentially impacting millions of sites in the human transcriptome. Lastly, the inherent sequence preferences of ADARs restrict their editing capabilities to specific adenosine (A) sites, excluding a subset of potential therapeutic targets. The proposed solution: A CRISPR-based RNA editing platform utilizing a bacterial enzyme to enable precise modifications of RNA sequences in cells. The faculty inventor developed bacterial deaminase-enabled recoding of RNA (DECOR) which employs an engineered Escherichia coli tRNA adenosine deaminase to perform adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing at specific sites in the transcriptome. Unlike traditional ADAR-based RNA editing, DECOR targets single-stranded RNA, expanding its editing capabilities beyond existing double-stranded RNA-targeting systems. This system has demonstrated high on-target editing efficiency while significantly reducing off-target effects. DECOR differentiates itself from other RNA editing technologies through its unique features. Firstly, it is the first ADAR-independent A-to-I editing platform, expanding the available tools for programmed RNA editing. Secondly, it exhibits broad compatibility with various RNA-targeting CRISPR systems, enabling flexible and efficient editing. Importantly, DECOR demonstrates a superior safety profile with significantly lower transcriptome-wide off-target effects compared to ADAR-overexpressing systems. This enhanced specificity is further improved in high-fidelity DECOR variants, minimizing unintended edits. Lastly, DECOR's therapeutic potential is highlighted by its ability to remove a disease-causing upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) gene, restoring normal protein expression levels.",

    "ip_description": "The technology enhances cytokine signaling and immune function, optimizing the antiviral and anti-cancer efficacy of Type III IFNs by adjusting cytokine-receptor interaction affinity and relative JAK geometry, providing an effective treatment for cancer and viral infections with reduced side effects. The unmet need: Due to limited efficacy and toxicity concerns, the use of therapeutic cytokines has been superseded or relegated to second-line therapy by advanced immunotherapeutics. The field of cytokine signaling plays a crucial role in the regulation of immune responses, including antiviral and anti-cancer activities. Type I Interferons (IFNs), for instance, are widely used for treating a range of viral infections and cancers due to their potent immune-modulatory properties. However, their use is often limited by severe side effects, primarily due to the ubiquitous expression of their receptors. Type III IFNs were developed as a less toxic alternative due to their tissue-specific receptor expression, particularly in the lungs and liver. Despite their lower toxicity, Type III IFNs are less effective in their immune responses, necessitating further advancements to enhance their efficacy while maintaining their reduced side effect profile. Current approaches to improving cytokine signaling have encountered significant challenges. While some strategies have focused on altering the affinity between cytokine receptors and Janus kinases (JAKs), these methods have typically resulted in increased sensitivity (lower EC50 values) but have not substantially enhanced the overall efficacy or maximum response (Emax) of the signaling. Additionally, the toxic effects of Type I IFNs remain a major concern. Efforts to optimize the geometry of intracellular JAK interactions have shown promise but are still in the early stages of development. Moreover, no existing engineered cytokines or molecules have successfully optimized both the affinity and geometry of these interactions, leading to suboptimal signaling and function. This underscores the need for innovative solutions that can simultaneously address these multifaceted challenges to improve therapeutic outcomes for viral infections and cancer. The proposed solution: Optimized cytokine signaling to amplify antiviral and anticancer efficacy while reducing the toxicity observed in Type I interferons. The faculty inventor, Juan Mendoza, established a method to develop compounds for cytokine signaling modulation through two main mechanisms: altering the affinity of cytokine-receptor JAK interactions and adjusting the relative geometry of intracellular JAKs. By optimizing these factors, it significantly enhances the signaling and functional potency of cytokines, which has notable antiviral and anti-cancer effects. Specifically, this technology shows that type III IFNs, which have limited efficacy under natural conditions, can be engineered to achieve a performance nearly equivalent to the highly potent but toxic type I IFNs. The tuning of both the extracellular receptor complex affinity and JAK-JAK geometry is key to achieving these improvements, laying the foundation for developing molecules that can modulate these interactions dynamically to either enhance or diminish the receptor-JAK interactions and their associated functions.",

Protein-based therapeutics, including antibody, enzyme replacement, and gene therapies, hold immense promise for treating a wide range of diseases. These biologics offer targeted and effective treatment options. However, a significant challenge lies in their potential to trigger unwanted immune responses in patients. These immune responses, involving both T and B cells, can manifest as hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, and the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). ADAs, in particular, pose a significant hurdle as they can neutralize the therapeutic protein, leading to reduced efficacy and necessitating dose escalation or treatment discontinuation. Current strategies to mitigate ADA formation, such as dose escalation, are often insufficient, highlighting the urgent need for innovative approaches to induce immune tolerance and enhance the safety and efficacy of these life-changing treatments. The proposed solution: Novel pathway of Flt3L-mediated immune regulation to attenuate the adaptive reaction to antigenic protein drugs.

The technology employs both native Flt3L and a fusion protein of Flt3L with Serum Albumin (Flt3L-SA) to enhance tolerogenic properties.

A critical area of research is the role of genetic and epigenetic factors in tumor development and treatment response. The BRCA1 gene, well-known for its involvement in DNA repair and tumor suppression, has been extensively studied. However, the biological significance of its pseudogene, BRCA1P1, has been largely overlooked, primarily due to the historical view of pseudogenes as non-functional genomic remnants. Recent studies have highlighted the potential regulatory roles of pseudogenes, particularly through the expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which can modulate gene expression and immune responses.\n\nExisting approaches to breast cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy, often face challenges due to tumor resistance and the complex interplay of immune evasion mechanisms.

The ability to control and enhance protein secretion has immense potential in developing novel therapeutics and improving biopharmaceutical production. For instance, many biotherapeutic proteins, such as insulin and growth hormones, are produced through recombinant DNA technology and require efficient secretion from the host cells for therapeutic efficacy.\nCurrent approaches for enhancing protein secretion often rely on empirical strategies, such as optimizing cell culture conditions, engineering signal peptides, or overexpressing chaperone proteins. These methods, while effective to some extent, often lack specificity and can have unpredictable effects on cellular physiology.

    "ip_description": "This method enables high fidelity decoding of neural activity in an interpretable manner with a small training data set. The Unmet Need: Measuring neural activity in the brain with a strong signal to noise ratio. Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) are systems that use signals from the brain to control a computer, robotic arm, or other device. At the core of BMIs are algorithms (\u201cdecoders\u201d) that translate signals from the brain into control signals that are used to control an external device. Using recorded neural activity for decoders is challenging because current methods can record from only a modest number of the neurons in the brain at one time and because these signals are intrinsically noisy. Prior decoding algorithms have leveraged only the instantaneous relationship between neural activity and movement. Recent work has shown that neural populations acts like a \u201cdynamical system\u201d: the current population state strongly predicts the population state a few moments later. The Proposed Solution: Leverage the dynamical system nature of the brain. The faculty inventors have developed a new algorithm, Decoding using Manifold Neural Dynamics (DeMaND), which leverages knowledge of how the brain acts as a dynamical systems to greatly improve decoding quality and requires less training data. DeMaND uses a two-step procedure to decode signals from neural populations. First, a continuous manifold is generated based on the neural population activity over time and the desired external control signals (e.g., arm/hand movements). This manifold is then gridded to create a discrete approximation to the continuous manifold. Second, to decode new neural data, DeMaND probabilistically infers a position on the manifold grid from binned spike counts of the recorded neurons. At each point in time, it outputs the corresponding values of control signals. By using interpolation, DeMaND is able to perform few-shot generalization from a small number of training example to decode a large space of control signal values over time. By constraining the population state to a manifold, and assuming dynamics on this manifold, DeMaND is able to more accurate infer population state, and therefore produce more reasonable control signal values over time.

Cocaine addiction is associated with compulsive drug-seeking, and exposure to the drug or to drug-associated cues leads to relapse, even after long periods of abstention. A variety of pharmacological targets and behavioral interventions have been explored to counteract cocaine addiction, but to date no market-approved medications for treating cocaine addiction or relapse exist, and effective interventions for acute emergencies resulting from cocaine overdose are lacking. BChE (butyrylcholinesterase) is a natural enzyme that is present in hepatocytes and plasma and it hydrolyzes its normal substrate acetylcholine. BChE can also hydrolyze cocaine at low catalytic efficiency into benzoic acid and ecogonine methylester, which are low in toxicity and rewarding properties. Protein engineering has greatly enhanced the catalytic potency and substrate specificity of human BChE (hBChE) for cocaine hydrolysis. The modified hBChE has more than 4400 times higher catalytic efficiency than wild-type (WT) enzyme with significantly reduced activity for acetylcholine. However, the recombinant hBChE protein has to be delivered via a parenteral route and has a very short half-life in vivo, making it potentially useful only for acute treatment of cocaine overdose. Development of an ability to stably deliver the engineered hBChE in vivo to allow continuous expression will be highly desirable. Although viral systems have been used for somatic gene delivery, the potential clinical applicability for this approach is greatly limited by drawbacks of viral vectors including: strong inflammatory response and tissue toxicity upon viral infection, genotoxicity and oncogenic risk of different viral vectors, limited packaging capacity for most viral vectors as well as extremely high cost for preparation of viral stocks at therapeutic grade and quantity. The proposed solution: Skin stem therapy to stably deliver the modified hBChE in vivo to prevent cocaine abuse, cocaine craving, relapse and acute cocaine overdose. The faculty inventor developed a skin stem cell CRISPR-based platform to stably deliver hBChE in vivo and protect against cocaine-seeking and overdose. The regenerated skin grafts are stable and shown to survive long-term. As such, the cutaneous gene therapy is long-lasting, minimally invasive, and safe. For cocaine addicts and individuals with potentially high risk of cocaine abuse who seek help or treatment, the cutaneous gene therapy approach with hBChE expression can address several key aspects of drug abuse, including reducing development of cocaine-seeking, preventing cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking, and protecting against cocaine overdose after skin transplantation, potentially making them \u201cimmune\u201d to further cocaine abuse. Because of the extremely high catalytic efficiency and high levels of hBChE present, this approach can be highly efficient in protecting a wide range of cocaine doses with little individual variation.

The faculty inventor has identified a discrete membrane-proximal anchor epitope of the HA stalk domain with potential to be broadly neutralizing and could lead to design and creation of a universal influenza virus vaccine. Broadly neutralizing antibodies target a conserved epitope near the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk domain of influenza viruses.

    "ip_description": "The unmet need: Solutions for CAR therapy insufficient efficacy and clinical non-response/relapse. CAR-T cells are T cells genetically engineered to express a scFv against a target antigen coupled to intracellular signaling domains borrowed from the endogenous TCR pathway. Since CARs recognize a chosen epitope, they provide an alternative, pMHC-independent pathway of T cell activation. Decreased expression of target antigen is a critical barrier for CAR-T clinical efficacy. It is especially problematic for FDA-approved CAR designs, as they are limited by up to 1,000-fold reduced sensitivity for antigen relative to T-cell receptors (TCRs), in part due to poor recruitment of downstream signaling molecules to facilitate T-cell signaling. As most clinically used CARs use similar intracellular signaling domains and differ mainly by choice of scFv, low sensitivity is common across designs. The proposed solution: Dual chimeric antigen coreceptors with increased antigen sensitivity. The faculty inventor developed a CAR system inspired by the interactions between CD4 or CD8 coreceptor and the TCR. The systems consists of co-expressed molecules: a novel chimeric CD8 or CD4 coreceptor (i.e., CoCAR, mimicking CD8 or CD4) to enhance signaling and a 42BB-CD3 CAR( mimicking TCR). The system induces CAR signaling that more closely mimics TCR signaling and will improve CAR-T efficacy in cases of downregulation of target antigen.

The Unmet Need: A simple and quantitative test for calprotectin detection in point-of-care or at-home settings. Calprotectin, a metal ion-binding protein complex, plays a crucial role in the innate immune system and has gained prominence as a biomarker for various intestinal and systemic inflammatory and infectious diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and tuberculosis (TB). Calprotectin is released from neutrophils and epithelial cells at sites of infection or inflammation, where it inhibits pathogen growth by sequestering environmental transition metal ions, such as Ni2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+. Its biostability and correlation with host immunity make calprotectin a useful marker of infection or inflammation. Currently, clinical testing for calprotectin levels relies on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), which require trained personnel and expensive equipment and are therefore limited to laboratory settings and less accessible to low-resource areas. Specifically, data collection of fecal calprotectin levels is usually impeded by low patient compliance to fecal immunochemical testing in general, and specifically among patients with IBD, with the necessity of sample transportation to the clinic as a primary deterrent, making monitoring disease progression and guiding management challenging for the physicians and their patients. The proposed solution: Fab-Enabled Split-luciferase Calprotectin Assay (FESCA), a novel quantitative method for calprotectin measurement. The faculty inventor introduces the Fab-Enabled Split Luciferase Calprotectin Assay (FESCA) to quantitatively measure calprotectin.

The Fabs and are fused with split nanoluciferase fragments which form active luciferase upon binding to calprotectin either in solution or in varied immobilized assay formats. FESCA can detect physiologically relevant calprotectin levels across various sample types, including serum, plasma, whole blood, and stool extracts.

    "ip_description": "The Unmet Need: Transcription factors remain largely untapped as pharmacologic targets due to the challenges in targeting protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013DNA interactions. Transcription factors (TFs) regulate cellular state by binding specific DNA promoter and enhancer sequences, thereby recruiting transcriptional machinery to activate or repress gene expression. DNA binding is carried out by diverse DNA-binding domains (DBDs), which are shared across large families of TFs and conserved across evolutionary landscapes. Many archetypal DBDs contain an \u03b1-helix oriented in the DNA major groove, which requires defined secondary, tertiary and/or quaternary folds for proper binding. Despite the complex three-dimensional structure encoded by DBDs, numerous studies have demonstrated that many DBDs are inherently modular, which permits retention of potent and specific DNA-binding activity when domains are separated from the rest of their parent TF or when grafted onto entirely new proteins. These finding suggest that molecules that mimic the structural features of DBDs could serve as minimal TF mimetics capable of interfering with or replacing endogenous TF activity. Current approaches in TF mimetics require synthesis or expression of long polypeptides, which suffer from low synthetic yields and poor pharmacologic properties, such as protease stability and cellular penetration. Theses physiochemical properties considerably limit their utility as chemical probes or therapeutics. The proposed solution: Modular synthetic transcriptional repressor platform for non-natural TF mimetics to target TF function through direct modulation of DNA binding. The faculty inventor developed a synthetic reconstruction of the MAX protein that is proteolytically stable, cell permeable and capable of binding specific DNA recognition sites in living cells. These non-natural, \u2018cross-dimer\u2019 synthetic DNA-Binding Domains (sDBDs) recapitulate the cooperative association of individual DNA binding helices, as found in hundreds of known transcription factors, however, their hybrid architecture suggests they should not interfere with protein-protein interactions between endogenous bHLH proteins. In order to access higher ordered protein topology the inventor established a modular, convergent synthetic route that enabled introduction of multiple non-natural stabilizing elements, and in the process identified the necessary structural features required for high affinity and specific DNA recognition.

The Unmet Need: Method to increase the efficiency of the OgeuIscB-\u03c9RNA genome-editing system. OgeuIscB, an evolutionary ancestor of Cas9, is an RNA (\u03c9RNA)-guided endonuclease capable of generating double-stranded breaks on genomic DNA in mammalian cells. The combination of programmability and compact size renders the system highly attractive for in vivo gene-editing applications. However, the overall low editing activity and the unstable performance across different loci impede the use of OgeuIscB for gene editing. Practical applications of IscB\u2013\u03c9RNA as a genome-editing agent also require careful assessment of its editing fidelity. The OgeuIscB- \u03c9RNA specifies to a 16-nucleotide region in target DNA which is 4-nucleotides shorter than that by Cas9. This may potentially lead to decreased specificity and a higher incidence of off-target cleavage. The proposed solution: A programmable engineered OgeuIscB-\u03c9RNA genome-editing platform for increased potency and specificity. The faculty inventors engineered the OgeuIscB-\u03c9RNA system for programmed genome editing by enhancing OGeuIscB variants with boosted DNA cleavage activity both in vitro and in human cells.

Traditional diagnostic methods, such as bacterial cultures and genomic sequencing, are often slow and expensive, limiting their utility in timely clinical decision-making. There is a pressing need for faster, cost-effective diagnostic tools that can predict HAIs and guide appropriate treatment strategies, especially in an era of rising antibiotic resistance.\n\nCurrent approaches to predicting and diagnosing HAIs suffer from several limitations. Advanced genomic sequencing, while highly accurate, is both time-consuming and costly, making it impractical for routine clinical use. Bacterial cultures, another common method, can take several days to yield results, delaying critical treatment decisions. These methods also fail to provide a comprehensive picture of the microbial ecosystem, focusing only on the presence or absence of specific pathogens rather than their relative abundance and interactions within the microbiome. This lack of broader microbial context hampers the ability to predict which patients are at higher risk for HAIs and to tailor antibiotic therapies effectively.

AD is characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and the overexpression of the amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) in the brain. Current therapeutic approaches, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, only provide symptomatic relief or slow disease progression.\n\nTraditional medicine has also been explored for its potential in cognitive enhancement. However, the need for more effective treatments that can directly target the pathological mechanisms of AD remains unmet. One promising area of research involves using exosomes as drug delivery vehicles due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver therapeutic agents to specific brain regions affected by AD.\n\nCurrent approaches to treating AD face several challenges. Despite the potential of exosomes as drug delivery vehicles, conventional methods often result in poor brain permeability and limited bioavailability of therapeutic compounds. For instance, compounds like Corynoxine-B (Cory-B), which are known to induce autophagy and reduce amyloid-\u03b2 levels, face difficulties in crossing the blood-brain barrier when administered alone.\n\nAdditionally, while exosomes can be engineered to target specific proteins like APP, the natural interaction between APP and its binding partners, such as Fe65, complicates targeted delivery.

It is estimated that C. difficile causes 223,900 cases and 12,800 deaths yearly with annual healthcare costs in excess of $1 billion dollars. C. difficile infection (CDI) symptoms range from asymptomatic colonization to mild diarrhea to severe pseudomembranous colitis, which can lead to mortality. Susceptibility to CDIs is associated with gut dysbiosis and the loss of microbiota-mediated colonization resistance.\n\nCurrent approaches to treating C. difficile infections, primarily through antibiotics, pose significant problems. While antibiotics can eliminate C. difficile, they also indiscriminately kill beneficial gut bacteria, further compromising the gut microbiome's integrity.

    "ip_description": "Innovative therapeutic strategy leveraging commensal microbiota, specifically by oral administration of Bifidobacterium, to enhance anti-tumor immunity, potentially improving cancer treatment when combined with checkpoint inhibitors. Unmet Need: Only 20-40% of patients respond to immunotherapy while a majority experience primary or acquired resistance to treatment. The field of tumor immunology has focused significantly on understanding how the immune system can be harnessed to combat cancer. A key area of interest is the infiltration of T cells into solid tumors, which has been shown to correlate with improved patient outcomes. However, the variability in immune responses among individuals poses a significant challenge. Emerging research indicates that factors such as the composition of commensal microbiota can impact anti-tumor immunity. Thus, there is an increased need to explore how manipulating these microbiotas could potentially enhance the body's natural defenses against tumors. Techniques like checkpoint inhibitors target specific proteins to stimulate an immune response, yet not all patients respond equally to these therapies. Additionally, the complex interplay between an individual's microbiota and their immune system contributes to inconsistent treatment outcomes. The unpredictability and variability of immune responses due to differences in microbial composition make it difficult to develop universally effective therapies. Therefore, there is a compelling need to better understand and manipulate endogenous factors, such as commensal microbes, to improve and personalize cancer treatment strategies. The proposed solution: Oral administration of Bifidobacterium to improve tumor control and abolish tumor outgrowth in conjunction with checkpoint blockade. The faculty inventor, Thomas Gajewski, established a method to modulate commensal microbiota to enhance anti-tumor immunity. The distinctiveness of this technology lies in its novel approach to cancer treatment by directly linking gut microbiota composition to immune responses against tumors. The method exploits the symbiotic relationship between host microbial flora and the immune system to induce stronger endogenous anti-tumor responses. The identification and utilization of Bifidobacterium, in particular, demonstrated a targeted microbial approach that synergizes with existing immunotherapies like anti-PD-L1.

The problem: Lack of accurate cavernous angioma biomarkers to distinguish high-risk cases. Neurovascular diseases such as cavernous angiomas (CAs) present significant challenges to the healthcare field, affecting approximately 0.5% of the population and potentially resulting in severe neurological complications. These conditions are characterized by abnormal blood vessel formations in the brain and spinal cord, often leading to symptoms ranging from headaches to seizures and strokes. The only current treatment of CAs is surgical resection of symptomatic lesions, which is associated with high morbidity and costs, and is limited in cases of multiple brain lesions. Although research has offered insights into the genetic factors and microbiome compositions associated with CAs, current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches remain insufficient. The integration of multi-omics data, including metabolomic analyses, is increasingly gaining attention for its potential to uncover novel biomarkers and mechanisms underlying these diseases, thereby fulfilling the urgent need for more sensitive and specific diagnostic tools. However, despite advances in genomics, proteomics, and microbiome studies, existing approaches have notable limitations. Many current diagnostic methods rely on imaging techniques and genetic tests that may not capture the full spectrum of disease variability or severity. These methods often fail to provide a complete mechanistic understanding of disease progression, making it difficult to differentiate between familial and sporadic cases or to appropriately gauge disease severity. The lack of precision in current approaches hampers early diagnosis and risk assessment, ultimately affecting patient outcomes. Therefore, innovative solutions that can integrate diverse biological datasets to enhance diagnostic accuracy and provide deeper mechanistic insights are critically needed in the neurovascular disease landscape.

    "ip_description": "The problem: Current approaches to further enhance the immunogenicity of tumors fail to counteract the mechanisms deployed by cancer cells to escape detection. The field of cancer immunotherapy has focused significantly on the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) which target proteins like PD-1 and PD-L1 to enhance the immune system\u2019s ability to detect and attack cancer cells. Despite their success, ICIs have shown efficacy only in a minority of patients as monotherapies. This limitation has driven exploration into methods of making tumors more immunogenic and, therefore, responsive to immunotherapies. Current strategies encompass the use of oncolytic viruses, gene therapies, and neoantigen vaccines. These approaches aim to stimulate the immune system more robustly or precisely by increasing the visibility of tumors to immune cells. However, each of these strategies has its drawbacks. Oncolytic viruses, while effective in certain cases, pose safety concerns related to viral toxicity, off-target effects, and genetic unpredictability. Gene therapy methods, specifically those involving adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), introduce single genes to enhance immune responses but often fall short in generating a sufficiently robust immune reaction. Neoantigen vaccines, though promising, demand patient-specific customization which is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. These vaccines also face challenges with the genetic variability of tumors, leading to potential immune escape mechanisms. Thus, there are significant technical and logistical hurdles in making these therapies universally effective against a wide array of tumors. The proposed solution: A method for localized delivery of hyperactive adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing enzymes for induction of neoantigens in tumor cells. The faculty inventor, Jeffrey Hubbell, developed a novel method to induce a multitude of neoantigens in tumor cells through extensive RNA editing. This is accomplished by locally delivering hyperactive adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing enzymes, making tumors more recognizable to a patient\u2019s immune system and potentially enhancing the efficacy of ICIs. By inducing thousands of RNA editing events, the therapy could serve as an off-the-shelf treatment, providing broader application across various cancer types. Compared to existing therapies, such as oncolytic viruses, gene therapies, and neoantigen vaccines, this method is advantageous in its ability to safely and effectively induce a multitude of neoantigens. The RNA editing approach not only enhances immunogenicity broadly but also avoids the genetic manipulation risks of viral therapies. By using hyperactive ADAR enzymes to introduce widespread neoantigen profiles, this method offers a scalable and potentially more universally effective cancer immunotherapy.",

    "ip_description": "The problem: Therapeutic vaccination has long been a promising avenue for cancer immunotherapy but is often limited by tumor heterogeneity with variation in the antigens present on cancer cell surfaces. In recent years, immunotherapies have emerged as promising anti-cancer therapeutics, led by the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs have shown efficacy but only provide a significant survival benefit in a small fraction of patients. Further immune activation using adjuvants can provide additional efficacy in the case of immunologically \u201ccold\u201d tumors, which are often resistant to ICIs. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists can powerfully trigger the innate immune system and potentiate an antigen-specific T cell response to fight against tumors. However, their clinical translation has been limited due to a narrow therapeutic window, where non-specific immune activation can produce excessive systemic inflammation and lead to chronic disease, highlighting the need for more targeted and less toxic therapeutic strategies. Current approaches have several limitations, particularly regarding the immunogenicity and efficacy of adjunctive treatments. The reliance on tumor-targeting proteins often leads to the development of anti-drug antibodies, thus restricting the number of doses that can be administered effectively. Additionally, small molecule TLR7 agonists have been associated with toxicity and systemic side effects when used alone. The complexity of the tumor microenvironment, characterized by hypoxia and acidosis, complicates treatment as well. These factors necessitate an alternative strategy that reduces these immunogenic and systemic risks while maintaining or enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. The proposed solution: A fully synthetic platform for cancer therapy by delivering immune-activating agents directly to tumor cells by exploiting unique tumor microenvironment properties improving efficacy and reducing systemic side effects. The faculty inventor, Jeffrey Hubbell, developed a fully synthetic cancer vaccine platform with delivery of tumor-targeting adjuvants directly to cancer cells without the need for antibodies. This technology utilizes pyridyl disulfide (PDS) moieties to exploit the excess unpaired cysteines on the surface proteins of tumor cells, enabling the binding of vaccines directly to the tumor. These vaccines incorporate Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists such as TLR7/8, TLR9, TLR4, or TLR2/6 to activate the immune system robustly against the tumors while minimizing systemic inflammation. Mannose groups are also included in the polymer structure to encourage uptake by antigen-presenting cells like dendritic cells, thus maximizing the immune response at the tumor site and tumor-draining lymph nodes. The technology eliminates the need for targeting antibodies, which significantly reduces the potential for anti-drug antibody development that can hamper the efficacy of cancer treatments. The synthetic nature of the platform allows precise customization of the polymer structure, facilitating targeted activation of the immune system while minimizing toxicity. By binding directly to tumor cells through the recognition of metabolic stress markers specific to cancer's microenvironment, the platform offers enhanced localization of immune activation and reduces the systemic side effects commonly associated with broader immunotherapeutic approaches. This precise delivery system opens new avenues for the efficient and safer treatment of cancers, particularly those that are resistant to existing therapies.",

    "ip_description": "The problem: Chronic, non\u2010healing wounds have reached epidemic proportions and have a sustainable impact on both an individual\u2019s quality of life and on healthcare costs as a whole. The field of wound healing is of critical importance in medicine, addressing the urgent need for effective treatments for chronic, non-healing wounds. These wounds, which can result from conditions such as diabetes or radiation therapy, significantly affect patients' quality of life and represent a substantial burden on healthcare systems. Wound healing involves a complex, well-orchestrated process through four main phases: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Each phase relies on the precise signaling of chemokines and cytokines to ensure proper cellular responses and tissue regeneration. In particular, dendritic cells (DCs) play an essential role in maintaining immune homeostasis and facilitating wound repair by clearing cellular debris through a process known as efferocytosis. However, chronic wounds often exhibit dysregulated signaling that impairs the healing process, necessitating new approaches to enhance wound recovery. Current approaches to treating chronic, non-healing wounds often fall short due to incomplete understanding and management of the underlying dysfunctional immune responses. For example, diabetic wounds frequently suffer from poorly regulated inflammation, leading to non-productive immune responses and stalled healing, eventually resulting in severe complications like limb amputation. Additionally, radiation-induced oral mucositis (RIOM), caused by cancer treatments, creates lesions in the oral cavity that are difficult to heal because radiation disrupts the normal wound-healing cascade and kills immune cells crucial for debris clearance. Existing therapies primarily focus on cancer treatment, not addressing the need for wound healing in these contexts. As a result, there is a significant unmet clinical need for innovative solutions that can effectively harness the immune system to promote wound repair in these challenging scenarios. The proposed solution: Engineered Flt3L to promote wound healing, specifically targeting non-healing wounds like diabetic ulcers and radiation-induced oral mucositis. Flt3L stimulates hematopoietic progenitors, enhancing the differentiation of classical dendritic cells, which play a crucial role in immune regulation and tissue repair. Flt3L is a protein that acts on hematopoietic progenitors and is essential for the differentiation of classical dendritic cells. Flt3L is currently used as a therapeutic agent primarily for immuno-therapeutic cancer treatments in proinflammatory settings. The faculty inventor, Jeffrey Hubbell, offers a novel application of FLt3L in the context of facilitating the healing of non-healing wounds. The approach capitalizes on the protein's role in expanding the dendritic cell compartment, pivotal in resolving chronic inflammation and promoting tissue regeneration. Dr. Hubbell developed an engineered version of the Flt3L and has conducted studies to treat mouse models exhibiting non-healing wounds, including a Type 2 diabetic excisional wound model and a radiation-induced oral mucositis (RIOM) model. The administration of Flt3L enhances dendritic cell frequency in wound tissues, which subsequently improves wound healing. Furthermore, the engineered version of Flt3L, which significantly reduces the therapeutic dose required by 20-fold, represents a substantial improvement over current treatments, making this technology not only innovative but potentially transformative for patients suffering from chronic wounds.",

    "ip_description": "Cell division is a fundamental biological process, ensured to be of high fidelity by the Chromosome Passenger Complex (CPC), a crucial protein complex involved in regulating various chromosomal and cytoskeletal activities. The CPC, composed of survivin, borealin, INCENP, and Aurora B kinase, governs essential cell division functions, including spindle and kinetochore assembly, error correction, and apoptosis regulation. This complex is immensely important in cancer research, as the dysregulation of cell division is a hallmark of cancer. The necessity for technologies that can differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous cells has been underscored by the unique properties and behaviors of CPC proteins, which vary between normal and stressed, drug-treated, or irradiated cancer cells, thereby offering a potential therapeutic intervention window. Current approaches to targeting cancer cells using CPC proteins face significant challenges. One major issue is that while survivin, borealin, and INCENP are primarily located within the nucleus and cytoplasm, they have been observed on the surface of cancer cells but not on normal cells. This differential expression presents a targeting opportunity, yet existing methods to leverage this feature effectively are limited. Additionally, these proteins' interactions and functionalities on the cell surface require further exploration to ensure robust and stable applications in therapies such as BiTES and CARTs. Moreover, the external stress on cancer cells, which increases the surface display of these proteins, introduces variability that complicates consistent target engagement, raising questions about the practicality and efficiency of current therapeutic strategies in clinical settings. The faculty inventor, Anthony Kossiakoff, developed novel high performance fragments of antibodies (Fabs), produced from a synthetic phage display library, targeting multiple domains of the three CPC proteins enabling precise detection and targeting.

    "published_date": "June 2, 2024",
    "ip_description": "A method to attenuate RSV and other NNS RNA viruses by reducing m6A modifications on their RNA. This approach enhances genetic stability, ensures sufficient attenuation, triggers higher immune responses, retains high immunogenicity, and makes vaccine production feasible. The problem: A live attenuated vaccine is one of the most promising vaccine approaches for RSV. However, a major problem is that natural RSV infection does not induce long-lived protection. Non-segmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA viruses encompass a wide range of significant human, animal, and plant pathogens in families such as Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Filoviridae, and Bornaviridae. These viruses, including human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), pose substantial health risks, particularly for infants, young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. For example, RSV is responsible for significant respiratory infections and has a high hospitalization and mortality rate in children under five years of age. Despite extensive research efforts, effective vaccines or antiviral treatments against RSV and other NNS RNA viruses remain unavailable. Given the global health impact, there is a critical need for new approaches to develop effective vaccines for these pathogens. Current methods to attenuate live viruses for vaccine use have several limitations. Traditional approaches often involve gene deletions or mutations achieved under stress conditions, but these methods can be simplistic and might not provide lasting attenuation due to the risk of reversion to a more virulent form. Another approach involves modifying structural proteins which can occasionally hinder the vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, traditional attenuation techniques might not fully prevent the virus from retaining pathogenic qualities. These limitations underscore the necessity for novel methodologies that ensure genetic stability and sufficient attenuation without compromising immunogenicity. Addressing these issues is essential to providing safer and more effective live attenuated vaccines against RSV and other NNS RNA viruses. The proposed solution: A novel strategy employing recombinant RSVs deficient in viral RNA (m6A) to enhance innate immune response which in turn promotes an adaptive immune response to RSV infection. The faculty inventor, Chaun He, developed a method for the attenuation of non-segmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA viruses, specifically respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), by targeting the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in their RNA. Normally, m6A modifications enhance viral replication and pathogenesis. The technology employs a recombinant RSV that lacks m6A sites in the G gene transcript, leading to defective replication and reduced pathogenicity in models like A549 cells and cotton rats' respiratory tracts. Notably, m6A-deficient RSV, such as rgRSV-G12, is significantly attenuated but retains high immunogenicity, offering complete protection against RSV. Thus, viral m6A methylation serves as a novel target for designing live attenuated vaccines for RSV and potentially other NNS RNA viruses. This approach is differentiated due to its multi-faceted genetic modifications that enhance vaccine strain stability and reduce the risk of reversion to a wild-type virus. Unlike traditional methods involving single mutations, multiple modifications in m6A sites mean reversion requires numerous genetic reversals, making it highly unlikely. Furthermore, m6A-deficient viruses maintain high immunogenicity and can elicit stronger innate immune responses, enhancing vaccine efficacy. The potential for applying this strategy across diverse NNS RNA viruses, combined with its ability to produce viruses at variable attenuation levels and economically feasible titers, underscores its universal applicability and superiority over existing vaccine generation methods.",

The problem: Radiation simultaneously induces biological effects on cancer cells and elicits an immune response. However, the immunogenic effects of radiotherapy are counterbalanced by immune suppressive effects and thereby contribute to treatment failure. Cancer immunotherapy and radiotherapy are areas of intense research due to their potential to effectively treat various types of cancer. One of the critical regulatory molecules in these therapies is the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF\u03b2), an anti-inflammatory cytokine with pleiotropic roles in crucial cell functions. Though TGF\u03b2 has been identified as a promoter of cancer progression and a significant target for cancer therapies, its intricate involvement in cell signaling complicates the development of successful treatments. Particularly, TGF\u03b2 signaling is essential for T cell survival, which adds another layer of complexity. Despite substantial interest and research in targeting TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways, there have been limited successes in translating these findings into effective clinical solutions. Current approaches to blocking TGF\u03b2 signaling, such as using blocking antibodies, have shown disappointing results in clinical trials. Targeting TGF\u03b2 signaling is further complicated by the fact that directly inhibiting TGF\u03b2 can have off-target effects and may also interfere with its necessary roles in other biological processes. Additionally, the lack of specificity in current treatments means that healthy cells can be adversely affected, diminishing the overall efficacy and safety of the therapy. Innovative approaches are required to enhance the precision of TGF\u03b2 targeting, particularly in the context of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which are often enriched in tumors and contribute significantly to immune suppression. Improving the targeting of TGF\u03b2 signaling specifically within these cells would represent a considerable advancement in cancer treatments, potentially increasing the effectiveness of both radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The proposed solution: Combined immune checkpoint and MDSC inhibitors during radiotherapy to overcome tumor radioresistance and improve outcomes for cancer patients. The faculty inventor, Ralph Weichselbaum, established a method around the modulation of TGF\u03b2 signaling in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to enhance cancer treatment efficacy. The method focuses on BAMBI, a decoy receptor that disrupts TGF\u03b2 signaling. Research demonstrates that radiation therapy decreases BAMBI expression in myeloid cells which leads to the degradation of BAMBI transcripts. Over-expressing BAMBI in MDSCs not only reduces their migratory and suppressive capacities but also, when combined with radiation or immunotherapy, enhances treatment efficacy. This approach involves using BAMBI-enriched myeloid cells or delivering BAMBI through AAV vectors, which preferentially target phagocytic myeloid cells prevalent in tumors.",

The problem: Tumor cells exploit numerous signaling pathways to promote malignant progression including tumor-promoting signals from erythroid progenitor cells. Cancer therapy has undergone significant advancements with the emergence of immunotherapies, particularly checkpoint inhibitors, which have shown the capacity to improve survival rates among cancer patients. However, these therapies still face limitations due to low response rates. Cancer's complexity arises from its ability to orchestrate systemic changes in the body, which support its progression and resistance to treatment. One example is cancer-driven modification of the erythropoiesis process, which results in the overproduction of artemin, a growth signal that enhances tumor progression. Incorporating the blockade of these growth signals, along with existing therapies, could potentially augment the effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitors and radiotherapy. Current approaches in cancer therapy, while groundbreaking, are not devoid of challenges. Radiotherapy, although widely used, often faces resistance that limits its efficacy. Similarly, the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors varies greatly among patients, with many experiencing minimal benefits. A key factor in this resistance is the presence of erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs), specifically CD45-Ter119+CD71+ cells, termed Ter-cells, which secrete artemin and activate signaling pathways that promote tumor growth and therapy resistance. These mechanisms highlight a critical obstacle: the failure of therapies to target and mitigate the contributions of these EPCs, thus hindering their full therapeutic potential. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that targets the underlying mechanisms of resistance to improve treatment outcomes overall. The proposed solution: Strategy to block the Ter cell-artemin axis to promote the therapeutic effects of both radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade. The faculty inventor, Ralph Weichselbaum, presents a novel cancer therapy that integrates the blockade of tumor-induced cancer-promoting signals with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy to achieve enhanced efficacy. Traditional immunotherapies that utilize immune checkpoint inhibitors have indeed improved survival rates among cancer patients, but response rates remain limited. This therapy targets the overproduction of artemin, a neurotropic peptide secreted by tumor-induced erythroid progenitor cells (Ter-cells), which facilitates cancer progression through RET signaling. By combining the blockade of these growth signals with checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-L1, the therapy not only augments the immunotherapy but also enhances radiation-immunotherapy, leading to increased tumor regression and improved patient outcomes as evidenced by decreased Ter-cell and artemin levels. This synergistic effect not only provides a more holistic approach to cancer treatment but also opens avenues for tackling immuno-resistant tumors, thereby offering a promising strategy to intensify the efficacy of existing cancer treatments.",

    "ip_description": "The unmet need: Platform to resolve unregulated immune potentiator enhancement and suppression of inflammatory and stimulatory responses\n\nThe innate immune response is vital for the success of prophylactic vaccines and immunotherapies. Control of signaling in innate immune pathways can improve prophylactic vaccines by inhibiting unfavorable systemic inflammation and immunotherapies by enhancing immune stimulation.\n\nIn vaccination, for example, helper molecules known as adjuvants are often required to stimulate innate pathways involved in antigen presentation and processing that are critical in invoking a productive adaptive immune response. Despite the necessity of such signaling events to maximize potency, excessive activation of signaling pathways by adjuvants can cause undesirable systemic inflammation, and limit tolerability and dosage in a clinical setting. Conversely in immunotherapy, it is often essential to have strong stimulation to improve the immunogenicity and mitigate suppression from a tumor micro-environment.\n\nAlthough these adjuvants can be potent activators of immune responses, a well-known limitation of current popular adjuvants is excessive and uncontrolled inflammation. This has motivated efforts to discover novel adjuvants with reduced inflammation profiles but it has proved challenging to develop novel pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonists capable of specifically tuning the level of stimulation in inflammatory pathways without disrupting the desired stimulation along immune activation pathways.\n\nAn alternative approach to regulating the innate immune response is through immunomodulators \u2013 molecules co-delivered with PRR agonists to reduce inflammation or otherwise modulate innate immune stimulation by enhancing or suppressing innate immune signaling pathways.\n\nThe proposed solution: Machine learning-enabled screening approach for efficient small molecule immunomodulators\n\nThe faculty inventor, Aaron Esser-Kahn, developed a machine learning-enabled active learning pipeline to guide in vitro experimental screening and discovery of small molecule immunomodulators that improve immune responses by altering the signaling activity of innate immune responses stimulated by traditional pattern recognition receptor agonists.\n\nThe machine learning-enabled screening approach presents an efficient immunomodulator discovery pipeline that has furnished a library of novel small molecules with a strong capacity to enhance or suppress innate immune signaling pathways to shape and improve prophylactic vaccination and immunotherapies.",

    "ip_description": "The problem: Current methods to evaluate OSA treatment fail to adequately capture CPAP adherence\n\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder characterized by recurrent complete or partial upper airway obstruction resulting in reduced oxygen levels at night, sleep fragmentation, and poor sleep quality. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is considered the treatment of choice for OSA. It works by delivering continuous air pressure, preventing upper airway closures during sleep. CPAP can easily be applied using a variety of masks worn on the face at night and is highly efficacious in treating OSA. However, poor adherence to CPAP treatment is a common problem, and thus novel technology and methods are needed for CPAP adherence tracking and supporting patients and providers.\n\nEffective OSA treatment requires all-night CPAP. But, current CPAP adherence tracking systems (e.g., smartphone apps) simply capture the number of hours the CPAP mask is worn per night and do not account for hours spent in bed without wearing CPAP.\n\nIn clinical practice, according to Medicare criteria, patients who wear their CPAP for 4 hours or more per night for 70% of nights are considered \u201cadherent\u201d to therapy. This metric is arbitrary and could be misleading because the sleep patterns can vary considerably, making it necessary to measure CPAP adherence relative to time spent in bed. Implementing more accurate CPAP adherence goals and guidelines requires patients to quantify CPAP wear time in proportion to the time spent in bed.\n\nThe proposed solution:\n\nThe faculty inventor, Esra Tasali, developed a new CPAP adherence tracking method that measures CPAP wear in relation to time spent in bed via a smartphone app interface. The CPAP tracking in the smartphone app provides users with meaningful feedback that aims to encourage and improve their CPAP adherence.

The negatively charged NV center in diamond is a promising defect-based spin qubit for many quantum applications. Single NV centers, necessary for high-spatial resolution quantum sensing as well as quantum communication schemes, and ensembles of NV centers, for high-sensitivity sensing, may be synthesized with controlled densities and spatial localization via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD). PE-CVD diamond growth operates in a majority hydrogen plasma environment, and hydrogen ions from plasma are known to diffuse into diamond, which may, in turn, passivate NV centers by converting them into hard-to dissociate nitrogen vacancy hydrogen centers (NVH centers). As such, hydrogen can form defect complexes with vacancies and NV centers during NV activation annealing, precluding NV center formation either by capturing vacancies and converting them to VHx centers or by passivating NV centers to form NVHx centers, which are optically dark spin defects. These defects are stable up to around 1800\u25e6C and thus are not annealed out during typical thermal processing. These processes are of concern with regards to NV center conversion efficiency, as the crystal contains substitutional nitrogen (Ns), vacancies, and hydrogen post-growth, before the formation anneal. David Awschalom has developed a method to minimize this undesired NVH center formation: an extra anneal step is completed after the PE-CVD growth step to diffuse the residual hydrogen out of the diamond crystal (\u201chydrogen out-gassing\u201d). This additional step removes hydrogen from the crystal before subsequent vacancy and NV center formation, thus preventing the hydrogen passivation and increasing the yield of NV center synthesis.",

An overarching goal for the development of bioelectronic devices is to achieve conformable and stable interfacing between the sensing surface and the tissue, which can only be realized by combining two aspects: 1. Soft and stretchable properties on devices for adapting to curvilinear tissue surfaces 2. Stable bonding between the electrical sensing surface and the tissue.

Administering and retaining drugs to the inside of the kidney is challenging for a few reasons: Access: normal human kidneys are situated high in the abdomen, making administering drug from the natural urine exit orifice, the urethra challenging; Short transit time of urine in the kidney prevents adequate contact time between drugs and the inner lining of the kidney collecting system for these drugs to exert their therapeutic effects; The anatomy of the kidney is divided into compartments so while the drug can encounter one compartment it may not get in contact with the rest, increasing the risk other parts of the inside of the kidney are not treated. Current methods for drug delivery to the kidney include the percutaneous/antegrade route and the transurethral/retrograde route. While the percutaneous route allows multiple drug administrations to the kidney under sedation for an extended period of time, it does not solve the problem of short drug transit time and uneven distribution of the drug inside the kidney. The transurethral route accesses the kidney by catheter through the urethra providing homogeneous distribution of the drug to the inside of the kidney yet it requires general anesthetic, has no mechanism to stay in place so only allows one-time administration, and does not solve the problem of short transit time.

However, these demonstrations have necessitated operation in dilution refrigerators at sub-Kelvin temperatures with vector magnets. These systems are costly (as much as $600K) and resource intensive, requiring entire rooms for operation. Additionally, these color centers cannot be efficiently addressed by microwaves and necessitate complex two-laser all-optical control schemes that suffer from a trade-off between fidelity and speed.

    "ip_description": "A novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) with a lactate-responsive linker, enhancing therapeutic specificity by remaining stable in healthy tissues and releasing its therapeutic payload in high lactate tumor environments. Unmet need: A highly specific cancer drug that selectively activates in the tumor microenvironment, minimizing side effects and toxicity. Lactate is elevated in the tumor microenvironment (produced by cancer cells), but not in surrounding healthy tissue. This concentration difference offers an opportunity to improve targeted drug delivery. ADCs are used to deliver anti-cancer agents directly to tumor sites. As of 2023, 11 FDA-approved ADCs exist. However, they often cause off-target toxicity and suboptimal activity, meaning the field needs more effective, less toxic solutions. Additionally, 'on-target toxicity' is an issue, where ADCs affect normal tissue expressing the target antigen. There is an emerging interest in using chemically-responsive linkers to improve drug delivery to tumors while minimizing toxicity. A lactate-responsive linker that stays stable in healthy tissue but cleaves in high lactate tumor environments is a promising approach for ADC optimization. The proposed solution: Antibody-drug conjugate incorporating a lactate-reacting linker. The faculty inventor has developed a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) with a lactate-responsive linker, structured as either enzyme-Ab-linker-payload or Ab-enzyme-linker-payload, which targets the lactate-rich tumor environment to enhance therapeutic specificity. This linker remains stable in healthy tissue but cleaves in tumor environments with high lactate levels by detecting products of lactate conversions (e.g., H+ and H2O2). After being triggered by this signal in the TME, the ADC can release its therapeutic payload into the tumor microenvironment. In a mouse model of breast cancer, the lactate-responsive ADC demonstrated greater efficacy and reduced tumor volume compared to a commercially available ADC with the same antibody and payload.",

They offer unique functionality for information visualization, wireless signal/power transmission and medical therapies. After decades of development, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have become one of the most advanced EL technologies, particularly for the display industry, owing to advantages that include high efficiency, high brightness, low-voltage operation, low prices, large-area scalability and mechanical bendability. Recently, a growing desire to intimately integrate electronics with the human body in the form of wearable and implantable devices has spurred new needs for the additional development of EL devices, particularly along the lines of incorporating skin-like softness and stretchability. The development of stretchable OLEDs that are compatible for integration with soft human body and tissue is highly desirable for enabling visual readout of sensing data through a soft display integrated with artificial electronic skin systems. There have been excellent demonstrations of flexible OLEDs, including the fabrication of highly flexible and monolithically integrated active-matrix organic OLEDs. However, uniaxial stretchability is more desirable, which is more challenging to realize than flexibility, as flexible devices need to withstand strains less than 1%, whereas stretchable devices need to be able to accommodate strains of over 10%. The inventors have developed a series of intrinsically stretchable light-emitting polymers (is-LEP) with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The novel is-LEPs show both stable photoluminescence and electroluminescence performance up to 100% strain.

And isotopically pure or enriched samples are used in scientific research and medical procedures. Isotopes can be separated via fractional distillation, gaseous diffusion, and centrifugation. The process can also be driven by chemical, magnetic, and electrostatic methods. But these techniques are often energy intensive and require many sequential separation steps.\n\nGaseous diffusion, distillation and gas centrifuges exhibit small isotopic separation effects that are overcome through large-scale installations where many separation stages are performed in sequence. Alternatively, a variety of laser-based techniques exist that are capable of separating isotopes to a much higher degree, but require ionization or excitation of the target isotope.\n\nThe faculty inventor developed a new method for isotope separation involving the embedding of atoms and molecules into ice. Specifically, the method is based upon isotope dependent embedding preferentially capturing heavier isotopes and isotopologues in a cryogenic water ice matrix in which the isotopes and isotopologues are entrained in a velocity controlled molecular beam and then collide with the capture matrix which exhibits excellent single-pass enrichment.\n\nCycling of these single-step enrichment events for all methods can lead to significantly higher levels of purification, and routes to scale-up can be realistically envisioned.

However, chemotherapy blocks the growth of noncancerous cells, which causes an assortment of adverse side-effects, including hair loss, nausea/vomiting/abdominal, fatigue, bleeding, and risk of infection (immunosuppression). These side-effects can be crippling and life-threatening, which limits the dosage and intensity of chemotherapy regimens in practice. Consequently, the therapeutic window may be too narrow for effective and tolerable treatment. Targeted chemotherapy addresses this challenge with monoclonal antibodies that guide attached chemotherapeutic agents to cells that express known molecular cancer markers. However, many malignant tumors do not exhibit targetable disease markers- and those that do often exhibit markers heterogeneously, which can lead to tumor recurrence and drug resistance. The faculty inventors have developed a novel cancer treatment platform using antibody-targeted enzymatic chemoprotection (ATEC) to reduce the adverse effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy on noncancerous cells while maintaining drug efficacy on malignant cells. ATEC inverts the approach of targeted chemotherapy to instead focus on selective protection of healthy tissues from cytotoxic compounds. In ATEC, an antibody fragment that binds to a molecular marker of a healthy tissue is conjugated to an enzyme that degrades a particular chemotherapeutic agent. This antibody-enzyme conjugate is administered to a patient prior to chemotherapy, coating healthy cells with chemoprotective enzymes.

While this approach is still in broad use, recombinant display technologies have now assumed the leading role in producing antibody\u2010based affinity reagents. A particularly powerful aspect of these engineered reagents is that other modules having myriad functions can be attached to them either chemically or through molecular fusions. However, these processes can be cumbersome and do not lend themselves to high throughput applications. Consequently, the faculty inventor developed a platform that can introduce multiple functionalities into a class of Fab\u2010based affinity reagents in a \u201cplug and play\u201d fashion. This platform exploits the ultra\u2010tight binding interaction between affinity matured variants of a Fab scaffold (FabS) and a domain of an immunoglobulin binding protein, protein G (GA1) that facilitates Fabs to be attached to a wide variety of molecular modules in a facile way. Newly engineered protein G variants and Fab scaffolds represent a 500-fold increase in binding affinity compared to previous-generation technology. Fab fragments can be attached together in a plug and play fashion to produce molecular entities having multi\u2010valency and multi\u2010specific properties.

Along with NTPDase-1 CD39, CD73 is an important regulator of a cells inflammatory response. Cell death/stress triggers release of ATP which activates pro-inflammatory and immunostimulatory cell pathways. ATP concentrations are decreased through down-regulation by CD39 mediated hydrolysis into ADP and AMP. The CD73 dephosphorylates AMP to adenosine which stimulates anti-inflammatory and immunosupressive responses. Many cancerous tissues (e.g., breast, pancreas, prostate bladder) highly overexpress CD73, with an ATP rich tumor microenvironment (TME) possibly resulting in accumulation of CD73. CD73 inhibition has been shown to reduce primary tumor growth and metastasis in mice, and CD73 targeted blocking by AMPCP inhibitors and anti-CD73 mAbs has been shown to reduce tumor growth in vivo. As a result, anti-CD73 therapies have received significant research interest with various antibody clinical trials underway. Current clinical trial evaluations of anti-CD73 antibodies do not specifically address the TME. The faculty inventor has developed antibodies which exhibit improved biochemical properties in the presence of high nucleotide concentrations typical of local tumor environments. By specifically targeting the nucleotide-rich TME, the developed antibodies are less likely to result in CD73 inhibition in healthy tissue/cells where CD73 action is important in reducing normal inflammatory response.

Based on previous reports on the application of IL-1\u03b2 in enhancing antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ responses, we envisioned that inflammasome-activating biomaterials that can produce IL-1\u03b2 in-vivo can be potentially employed as vaccine adjuvants. The faculty inventor developed a modulable inflammasome activating peptide agonist in a subunit-vaccine formulation along TLR 4 agonist in an oil-in-water emulsion. Further, since altered physico-chemical properties with other known agonists have been observed to induce significant differences in antigen-specific responses, they developed bio-materials by conjugating this peptide to a non-immunogenic polymer scaffold. These biomaterials can be used as an additive (vaccine adjuvant) to enhance or modulate immune response to a vaccine in combination with other known conventional agonists. Overview of the proposed mechanism of action of PAI nanovaccines based on mechanistic analyses herein. PAI nanovaccines enhance endocytosis by antigen-presenting cells on account of their \u223c50 nm structure. Their secondary structure localizes effects to the injection site. Upon endocytosis, they then activate endosomal TLR7 and induce lysosomal rupture to result in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cytosolic delivery of neoantigen to afford enhanced antigen presentation on MHC-I.

Retransmitting data packets that are not compatible can lead to stuttering, poor quality, and user frustration. Current technologies, such as DVC and QRAM, share similar neural network video encoders to retransmit data packets but lack an achievable rate of data-scalable video coding. These error-resilient technologies use redundancy to handle packet loss which compromises quality and compression efficiency. Moreover, these systems are disorganized as redundancy is increased even after frames have experienced packet loss. The faculty inventor has found a way to maintain smooth video playback without waiting for retransmitted packets. Grace, a new autoencoder-based real-time video communication system, uses neural networks in a novel packetization scheme that customizes autoencoders. Grace proves that the customization of the autoencoder training process can make video streaming loss-resilient which is an attribute that standard autoencoders lack. When all data is received through Grace the decoded visual quality will be on par with advanced video coding formats (H.264 and H.265). If fewer data packets are received, the visual quality of the frame will remain proportional to the amount of received data.

These variants exhibit increased viral transmissibility and a partial evasion of immunity that is induced by natural infection and vaccination.

The faculty inventor has generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from convalescent donors that bound three distinct domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. A subset of these mAbs neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs against three different regions of the spike protein. These results emphasize that patients who were exposed to the first pandemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 possess neutralizing antibodies against current variants.

Through an evaluation on over one hundred datasets, VAQ outperforms the state-of-the-art quantization and cans-based methods. Comparison of quantization methods across three large-scale datasets. For the same budget, hardware-accelerated methods (i.e., Bolt and PQFS) may sacrifice accuracy (vs. PQ and OPQ) to accelerate the query execution. In contrast, our method, VAQ, outperforms Bolt and PQFS in terms of runtime while significantly improving accuracy compared to PQ and OPQ. Advantages: High accuracy and sustainability, Accelerated query performance, Competitive runtime performance. Applications: Image databases, Comparisons in document collections, Time-series databases, Genome databases.",

Screening for frailty in our thoracic surgery population indicates that nearly 70% of patients are frail or prefrail at the time they are referred to our outpatient clinic for possible surgery. Potential adverse outcomes after major surgery include a higher rate of complications and mortality, longer duration of hospital stay, more likely discharge to other\u2013than-home, increased rates of readmissions, and higher costs of hospitalization. Frailty can be modified in some patients through preoperative exercise (prehabilitation), often with as little as 1 week of high intensity training.

This new synthesis strategy of silicon-based photoelectrochemical materials is fast and efficient and holds a wide variety of applications in biological modulation and energy science. This fabrication technique is compatible with the processing of ultrathin, soft, and flexible silicon micro membranes, which are used as interconnect-free biomodulations devices. Through ex vivo heart pacing and in vivo sciatic nerve stimulation the utility of such materials was demonstrated. The flexibility of the device was able to contour to the curvilinear wet surface of the heart and sciatic nerve while delivering adequate optical pulses that were recorded through electromyography recordings. Nanoporous/non-porous silicon materials enable efficient photoelectrochemical effects, and their biomimetic structure makes them suitable for application in biointerfaces.

PTEN Loss-of-Function (LOF) suppresses tumor cell-intrinsic interferon gene stimulator (STING) expression, inhibits downstream signaling, and contributes to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) resistance in over 50% or mCPRCs. Only 10% of mCRPC patients respond to CTLA4 and PD1 pathway-directed therapy. To increase this percentage, researchers study fundamental DNA repair and oncogenic signaling pathways. The inventors have developed a novel PARPi/PI3Ki combination therapy modeled on PTEN deficiency which activates the c-GAS/STING pathway within tumor-associated macrophages. Their therapy enhances T cell recruitment and activation in c-Myc-driven murine prostate cancer models. In vivo proof-of-concept experiments with PARPi/PI3Ki combination therapy caused murine tumor regression. Flow cytometric analyses confirmed increased infiltration of activated macrophages and reduced gene expression associated with pathogenic fibroblast signaling pathways. A) Inventors at the University of Chicago propose treating mCPRC by activating the myeloid cell c-GAS-STING pathway with PARPi/PI3Ki combination therapy or STING agonists within the tumor microenvironment. The combination of PARPi + PI3Ki induces the release of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments into microvesicles that activate the c-GAS/STING pathway within myeloid cells. As STING pathway activation induced by DNA damaging agents is abolished within the tumor microenvironment of PTEN-deficient PC, the inventors propose DNA damage-mediated STING activation to enhance immune responsiveness in prostate cancer. B) PARPi/PI3Ki/ADT Induces Tumor Regression in Myc-CAP via a Non-Tumor Cell Autonomous. Immune Mechanism. Syngeneic PTEN-proficient MyC-CaP tumor-bearing immuno-competent FVB and immuno-deficient mice were treated with drugs indicated under un-castrated or castrated conditions, and in the presence or absence of PDL1 antibody.

    "ip_description": "Integration of quantum spins into classical electronic devices has been a major challenge. However, the ability to do so would limit spectral noise and line width broadening of emissions from solid state devices, resulting in improved device performance. The divacancy in Silicon Carbide is a recently developed defect spin qubit displaying many attractive properties that could address these challenges. However, these defects have suffered from relatively broad optical lines, charge instability and relatively small Stark shifts. This invention addresses these issues through a semiconductor structure embedded with highly coherent single neutral divacancy spin defects having near-infrared transitions with a narrow emission spectrum demonstrating a method for mitigating spectral diffusion in solid-state emitters. The inventors leverage mature silicon carbide semiconductor fabrication techniques to p-i-n heterostructures with tunable charge and electrical field environment enabling narrowing optical lines, stabilizing charge states and creating large Stark shifts. These heterostructures constitute a testbed for studying the photoionization of divalent defects, resulting in a charge reset scheme that allows for full optical control of the defect. The combination of the effects suggest doped silicon carbide heterostructures are a powerful quantum platform for enabling narrow optical lines, long spin coherence, high fidelity control, electrical tunability and efficient charge repumping. This platform also opens unique avenues for spin-to-charge conversion, single-shot readout, electrically driven single photon emission, electrical control of spin and the integration of defects into new device geometries.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus i.e. SARS-CoV-2, which has spread rapidly throughout the world and was declared a global pandemic by WHO in March 2020. Nsp15 is a nidoviral RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) carrying a C-terminal catalytic domain belonging to the EndoU family. Nsp15 enzyme is essential in coronavirus biology and there is a need for inhibiting Nsp15 activity to provide therapeutic interventions, particularly to treat diseases caused by nidoviruses that encode Nsp15. The invention is a potential small molecule treatment for COVID-19 utilizing combination of an on-the-market drug (tipiracil) which is a candidate for a COVID-19 therapy and COVID-19 enzyme (NendoU). Tipiracil targeting of NedoU was not previously known but it has been effective in colon cancer due to inhibition of thymidine phosphorylase which metabolizes trifluridine. It may be possible to repurpose this drug against SARS CoV-2 virus with Nsp15 being the drug target as Nsp15 is one of essential non-structural proteins of SARS CoV-2 virus. This technology has potential applications in COVID-19 treatment.",

There is a lot of focus on targeted intracellular delivery for improved therapy of cancer and intracellular infections. Intracellular delivery of various drugs can sharply increase the efficiency of various treatment protocols. The inventors have developed polymersome nanoparticles to deliver cargo such as stapled peptides. The proof of concept particle is a CD19 Fab linked to the polymersome through a cysteine linker and the stapled peptides (SAH-MS1-18) are enveloped by the polymer. The approach allows an efficient delivery of biologic therapeutics such as stapled peptides using nanomaterials since peptides typically are not cell permeable. The lower density of the targeting Fab facilitates better delivery. The CD19-targeted polymersomes greatly improved the uptake and endosomal escape of therapeutic peptides, amplifying their therapeutic effects by orders of magnitude. The potential applications lie in more efficient intracellular drug delivery of stapled peptides for treatment of cancer.

    "ip_description": "The invention is a method to fabricate membranes made from exfoliated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) for improved separation performance and membrane stability. Reverse osmosis (RO) membranes are undergoing widespread adoption in desalination applications as global water supplies are becoming increasingly stressed, forcing consumers to turn to more challenged water sources\u2014brackish- and seawaters, for example\u2014to meet demand. RO membranes require significant energy inputs to remove the salt entrained in these source waters, however, rendering the technology economical unattractive in some applications. This technology reduces the input energy required to remove dissolved solids from source water, extending the attractiveness of RO membrane separations to applications or regions that may have been previously economically unviable. By increasing membrane water permeability to near thermodynamic entitlement limits while keeping the salt rejection constant, the energy requirements for filtration of seawater and brackish water decrease by approximately 15% and 50%, respectively. The membrane further exhibits increased selectivity, especially towards smaller components such as boron, which would obviate the need for the multi-pass RO systems that are necessary for wastewater treatment and desalination of water for irrigation. Membranes are fabricated using by stacking exfoliated two-dimensional samples with precise, uniform, and optimal interlayer spacing through a novel drying and rewetting method enabled by covalent surface functionalization. Membranes fabricated using this approach demonstrate high separation performance without having to store the material in a hydrated condition, which contrasts starkly to existing fabrication methods, requiring precise control over the degree of hydration of the membrane (which must be stored in water for the entirety of their lifetime, limiting commercial viability).",

    "ip_description": "Use of organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells are a developing energy technology which shows significant potential to become a cheap source of electric energy production even when compared to silicon-based solar cells. As compared to silicon solar cells, OPV cells weigh less since they can be constructed in thinner configurations, cost less to manufacture, exhibit a higher degree of flexibility/versatility, and their use/fabrication have a lower impact on the environment. These qualities make OPV cells good candidates for industrial applications in the textile, vehicle, and building sectors, as well as for creating power in areas where energy generation infrastructure is not available. Current challenges in OPV solar cell development include two key issues; the need to increase device power conversion efficiencies, and the high cost of both donor and acceptor materials used in unit construction. To develop solutions to current OPV solar cell limitations the inventors have developed/synthesized small electron deficient molecular compounds and polymers which can act as electron acceptors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) type OPV solar cells. Initial experimental testing of the synthesized perylene diimide derivatives functionalized at the ortho-position (alpha PPID, alpha PBDT) for use as electron acceptors in non-fullerene OPV cells exhibited high electron mobilities. The synthesized alpha PDI material as used as an acceptor showed superior photovoltaic performance as compared to the synthesized beta PDI-based derivative by as much as 39%. Overall, testing indicated that use of alpha substituted PDI derivatives is a promising electron acceptor material for enhancing the operation/efficiency of OPV solar cells. Current approaches to develop new electron acceptor materials for use in OPV solar cells such as the fullerene derivatives PC61BM and PC71BM show promise, however their high production costs, their unstable nature, and their limited visible light absorption qualities minimize their potential for use in widespread commercial/industrial applications.",

    "ip_description": "Use of Li in electric vehicle batteries, portable electronic devices, and stationary energy storage applications has expanded significantly in recent years, and this growth is expected to continue to increase. The primary commercial technology used to recover Li is its extraction from concentrated brine water (83% of the market). This technology utilizes solar energy in arid climates to evaporate water taking up to 12-18 months to complete, followed by a multi-step chemical treatment process and precipitation of Li2CO3. This time consuming/multi-step process has limited its commercial application. Other Li extraction methods have been investigated (e.g., use of seawater, flow back water, geothermal reservoir waters) to address these inefficiencies. Currently, use of seawater as a Li source is not economical due to seawater\u2019s low Li concentrations (0.177 ppm). Development of an economical and environmentally friendly technique to extract Li from seawater could provide an abundant and sustainable source of this material for future applications. Electrochemical extraction of Li from brines using Li-ion intercalation electrodes (e.g., olivine LiFePO4, spinel l-MnO2, layered LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2(NMC)) have demonstrated acceptable Li selectivity/recovery rates, but the process does not tailor the materials composition/properties for use in an aqueous environment. Inventors at University of Chicago have demonstrated that use of a new material from the layered cobalt oxide family can deliver high selective Li extraction through material structural design. A core-shell structured (NaLi)1-xCoO2 material was synthesized using a core Li-phase (Li0.94 CoO2), a shell Na-phase (Na0.51CoO2), and a transition intermediate phase through Na ion-exchange of the parent Li1-xCoO2 material. The developed electrochemical extraction process works by extracting (electrochemical intercalation) Li from a dilute Li solution and recovering (electrochemical deintercalation) Li in a fresh solution. The core Li-phase limits layer expansion and prevents Na intercalation/promotes high Li selectivity, and the shell Na-phase/intermediate phase maintains electrode stability from further Na-ion exchange. Test results indicated that the (NaLi)1-xCoO2 electrode can extract Li selectively over a range of Li and Na solutions (e.g., Li:Na mol ratios between 1:100-1:20,000). In the lowest Li concentration solution (Li:Na ratio of 1:20,000) a recovery solution was realized with a Li:Na mol ratio of ~ 7.6:1 in a single electrochemical extraction equivalent to a high Li selectivity of 1.5 x 105. These tests achieved the highest selectivity for Li reported to date, and indicated that the layered cobalt oxide material could be used to selectively extract Li from seawater. As reported in the literature, the majority of previously evaluated materials were only capable of selectively extracting Li from highly concentrated Li brines.",

Protocols for quantum source coding are increasingly useful to enable more efficient storage and transmission of quantum data among emerging quantum infrastructures. However, despite developments in quantum source coding schemes severe practical challenges have prevented their implementation. There are three prominent challenges that plague existing quantum source coding schemes: 1. Complex operations and/or deep circuits of the source code are out of reach for near-term devices 2. Application of these schemes to general purpose quantum computing architectures complicate implementation with significant overhauls and slowdowns 3. Existing schemes are based on a qubit intensive system, block-coding, to guarantee a near lossless compression at near-optimal rates. The inventors have worked to improve the practicality of quantum compression through their protocols in quantum source coding. With minimal additional overhead resilience to noise is achievable so that the qubit error rate scales only polylogarithmically with the message size. The proposed specialized class of architectures and accompanying algorithms are based on quantum sorting networks characterized by logarithmic running times showcasing their easy implementation. A proposed simple blocking procedure reduces quantum hardware cost and the susceptibility to noise while increasing compression rates making them particularly appealing for near-term devices.

Modern biolectronics with multi-scale structures are used extensively for drug delivery, biosensing, and biological modulations.

Therefore, nanostructuring of the bioelectronics surfaces represents a promising way to improve the performance of these devices. Electrode surface coating with carbon nanomaterials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, is widely used to reduce the impedance at the electrode-saline junctions and increase the charge transfer rate. However, the polymer binding process usually associated with carbon coating procedures may result in 'dead' volumes or surfaces and increased total device thickness.

    "ip_description": "Pyridyl moieties are highly useful in catalytic applications because of their robust redox stability, metallic coordination versatility, and functionalization ease. However, their application is limited due to poor solubility and susceptibility to degradation. As such, catalysts that address these limitations would have a high utility in a wide range of organic reactions. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have previously been shown to mitigate some of the disadvantages of solid-state catalysts, but have only been applied in limited applications, and never with nitrogen donating moieties. The inventors synthesized UiO-type MOFs postsynthetically metalated with Ir or Pd. The MOFs are novel in that they contain a 2,2\u2019-bipyridial functional fragment. The catalysts have a particle size of 300nM, surface areas of 365m2/g (Ir metalated) and 457.5m2/g (Pd metalated), and pore sizes of 5.6\u00c5 (Ir metalated) and 6.7\u00c5 (Pd metalated). The invention is a novel metal organic framework catalyst containing UiO and a 2,2\u2019-bipyridial functional fragment, postsynthetically metalated with Ir or Pd. The catalyst is amenable for use in a range of organic reactions with high regioselectivity. The inventors validated the MOF in several organic reactions, including: borylation of aromatic C-H bonds, ortho-silyation of benzylicsilyl ethers, and dehydration of substituted cyclohexenes. The yields of each reaction were at least 83% and the catalyst was shown to be recyclable up to 20 times with no metallic leaching or catalyst structural changes.",

The inventors used a multianalyte protein system to assay levels of 49 plasma proteins in a cohort of 74 IPF patients and 53 control patients. The inventors demonstrated that relative levels of the proteins: MMP7, IGFBP1, and TNFRSF1A can be used to delineate between IPF patients, healthy patients, and patients with similarly presenting lung diseases. The elevated levels of these proteins are localized to the lung microenvironment and are secreted by the alveoli, and are mechanistically associated with IPF disease progression. The invention is a method of diagnosing IPF patients using expression of a panel of proteins in the peripheral blood. Relative protein expression levels can be assayed by serum mRNA quantification.

    "ip_description": "Embryonic and fetal hemoglobin have a higher affinity for oxygen than their adult counterpart, and as such, gene editing techniques to revert red blood cells to produce infant or fetal hemoglobin are being explored for the treatment of sickle cell anemia. Problematically, these techniques require the use of toxic and side-effect ridden chemotherapy to deplete unmodified red blood cells. It is known that transcription factor binding (GATA1) induces the forced looping responsible for the shift in red blood cell production of infant and fetal hemoglobin to adult hemoglobin and that BET Bromodomain proteins are required to facilitate GATA1 binding. The inventors therefore hypothesized that BET Bromodomain inhibitors could prevent GATA1 binding and revert red blood cell expression of fetal hemoglobin. The invention is a method of using a BET protein inhibitor for the treatment of sickle cell anemia. This treatment strategy induces red blood cell expression of embryonic and fetal hemoglobin genes, and by inducing increased overall production of hemoglobin. This treatment strategy is safer than gene editing in that it does not require red blood cell depletion, and does not make irreversible genetic modifications to the patient. In in vitro proof-of-concept experiments erythroleukemia cell lines (K562, HEL), cells were treated with the BET inhibitor JQ1 at 200nM for 5 days. Treated cells showed an increase in hemoglobin accumulation, and a significant increase in the transcription of embryonic and infant hemoglobin genes (HBG1, HBG2) as compared to the adult hemoglobin gene (HBB).

Improved assays are highly desirable to triage patients exposed to radiation, since increased cancer risk can be conferred even without the onset of symptoms. DNA damage caused by radiation is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) that oxidize DNA nitrogenous bases, resulting in base mispairings and ultimately oncogenic mutations. One such commonly occurring oxidized nitrogen base is 5-formyladine (5-FODU), which occurs when thiamine is oxidized. The investigators synthesized a pro-fluorescent hydrazine probe that can react with the aldehyde in 5-FODU, allowing this DNA damage byproduct to act as a proxy for quantifying the DNA damage itself. The invention is a method for the quantification of DNA damage in which a pro-fluorescent hydrazide, also known as an aldehyde reactive probe (ARP), is incubated with cells and will react with 5-FODU in the cellular DNA to form a fluorescent complex.

Current therapies only mitigate symptoms and do not address the underlying pathophysiology responsible for disease progression. It is known that individuals with SCA6 have an expanded PolyQ tract in the CACNA1A gene (Q4-Q17 to Q19-Q33), but it was previously inconclusive as to how this abnormality impacts translation of the gene to the product ion channel a1A. The inventors discovered that the CACNA1A gene is bicistronic associated with an IRES and encodes a transcription factor (a1ACT). The Poly Q variant of a1ACT promotes Purkinje cell degradation, while the canonical variant is essential for Purkinje cell function. The invention is a microRNA (3191), that blocks the IRES-mediated translation of the pathogenic Poly Q variant of the a1ACT transcription factor, without impacting translation of the the associated a1A ion channel.

The stent degrades in a matter of hours, leaving behind a healed inner mucosal layer with no exposed collagen. The inventor validated the prototype stent using an ex vivo swine model and compared fluid and microbial permeability to that of stapled and sewn anastomoses. The invention resulted in dramatically lower permeability of anastomoses. Designed to reduce anastomotic leaks and postoperative infections, lower anastomosis permeability than established anastomotic techniques, minimizes intraluminal collagen exposure, and maintains good blood supply to healing bowel edges.",

    "ip_description": "Lymph node metastases are a commonly occurring cancer pathology that in some patients indicate the disease spreading to distant organs, and in other patients indicate disease evolution to a more aggressive state predisposed to relapse. Current approaches to stratify patients based on these metastases focus on comparing the metastases to the primary tumor, rather than distinct molecular subtyping of the metastases themselves. This approach fails to effectively stratify and identify patients in need of more aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy. The investigators measured mRNA expression levels in 29 primary tumors and 72 different lymph node metastases from 34 different head and neck squamous cell cancer patients. Clustering these results showed the presence of three distinct lymph node metastasis sub-types, one of which was an invasive sub-type that predicted far worse relapse free survival then the other sub-types. The investigators thus demonstrated that analysis of lymph node metastases can be revealing of patient prognosis. The product is a method of predicting patient prognosis and tumor biology by sequencing mRNA associated with 73 genes in tumor lymph node metastases and clustering the data to assign the metastases to one of three sub-groups. The method was originally developed on HPV-negative advanced stage head and neck squamous cell cancers and was later extended to breast cancer and melanoma. In a test cohort of 18 head and neck squamous cell cancer patients, the method was found to have a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 82% at predicting patient outcomes. When extended to breast cancer patients, the method predicted patient outcome with a p-value of P=0.04.",

The investigators used a combined mass spectroscopy and genomic approach to identify a RKIP-regulated network of target kinases involved in a metastatic signaling cascade. They then showed that the simultaneous inhibition of 4 kinases from the network mimicked the anti-metastatic effects of RKIP. The invention is a method of treating metastatic cancer, using 4 different kinase inhibitors in the RKIP-network that target MEK1/2, p38 MAPK, JNK, and MLK 1/2/3/DLK.

    "ip_description": "Catastrophic forgetting or interference is the inability of an artificial neural network (ANN) to learn multiple sequential tasks without a degradation in the accuracy of a previously learned task. When an ANN learns a new task, it disrupts connection weights that were important for solving a previous task. Current solutions are limited in the extent to which they boost sequential task accuracy or require high computational overhead. Synaptic stabilization weighs the importance of each synapse to determine which to override when learning a new task and context dependent gating uses a random distribution of non-overlapping nodes for each learned task. When these two methods are combined in tandem, a synergy occurs resulting in higher task efficiency retained over more learned tasks than when each method is applied alone. A novel algorithm that combines synaptic stabilization and context dependent gating to enable neural networks to \u201cremember\u201d previous tasks when trained on new tasks. The resulting algorithm can be applied both on feedforward or recurrent network architecture and is compatible with both supervised and reinforced learning. A recurrent neural network (RNN) was trained using both supervised and reinforcement-based learning on a battery of 20 sequential tasks commonly used in neuroscience experiments to test capabilities such as decision making, working memory and categorization. Implementation of the algorithm with supervised learning boosted average task accuracy from 80.0% to 98.2% as compared to synaptic stabilization with context signal alone. Similarly, implementation of the algorithm with reinforcement learning resulted in an average task accuracy of 96.4%. Similar results were reported for feedforward neural networks trained on image classification tasks.",

    "ip_description": "Presently, physicians rely on a costly and invasive battery of tests for diagnosing ALS. Early detection of ALS can improve patient survival and quality of life as well as promote access to investigational new drugs, and thus such a diagnostic is highly desirable. Lack of upper motor neural control is a hallmark of ALS. Intermuscular coherence quantifies the extent to which co-activated muscle groups are actuated at the same frequency of motor neuron impulse. The investigators showed it provides an objective metric of whether upper motor neural control of muscles is normal or aberrant. The investigators further demonstrated the utility of intermuscular coherence as a biomarker for ALS detection. The product is a biomarker and associated method of detection where electromyographic (EMG) readings from a patient\u2019s arm muscles are converted into an intermuscular coherence measurement. This measurement can then be used to determine whether the patient has normal motor neural control of muscles or is likely to have ALS. The investigators tested the biomarker in a study of 15 ALS patients diagnosed on average within the last 17 months, and 15 control patients. They found that the average intermuscular coherence was approximately 4 times greater in the control condition than in the ALS condition. This biomarker had both a sensitivity and specificity of 87%. Earlier and more accurate detection of ALS. Testing can be performed with pre-existing EMG sensors and requires minimal training to administer. Testing only requires the patient hold arm at a 90\u00b0 angle parallel to the floor and does not require complex movements like previous intermuscular coherence tests.

MXenes are typically synthesized through selective etching in aqueous solutions, which leaves the MXene surface terminated with a mixture of fluoride, oxygen, or hydroxyl (OH) functional groups.

    "ip_description": "Lithium (Li) is a highly reactive alkali metal with excellent heat and electrical conductivity properties, making it useful for a variety of industrial applications, but because of its reactivity, pure elemental Li is not found in nature. Most commercial Li extraction processes involve mining to reach underground deposits of Li-rich mineral ores (30%) or extraction from geothermal well brines (70%). The demand for Li will increase dramatically due to its need in battery applications such as electric vehicles and consumer electronics. Seawater and brines are a promising supply of Li, though they may be in very low concentrations among with other ions. A reliable Li extraction method from these sources would find high commercial value. Current extraction techniques primarily rely on evaporating seawater/brines to concentrate the Li, but these require extensive land use and time. Additionally, seawater/brines contain a variety of dissolved ions (e.g., Na), many of which are present in much greater quantities than Li, making the capture of Li over other dissolved chemical species very challenging. As a result, it is nearly impossible for traditional separation techniques to extract Li from seawater/brines without excessive energy consumption, fouling of filtration media, and/or use of chemical regenerants. To date these processes have proved uneconomic. Inventors at the University of Chicago have developed a technique for Li extraction from dilute waters/brines. The technology utilizes the 1D olivine compound FePO4 as a host material to control Li selectivity by manipulating the intercalation pathway. Results showed that Li and Na phase separate in FePO4. This phase separation can be utilized to increase Na intercalation energy barrier through creation of partially filled 1D Li channels by a non-equilibrium solid solution Li seeding process. Li seeding into the host FePO4 material is achieved through electrochemical/chemical processes. The developed platform as evaluated through density functional theory and structural characterization (e.g., XRD, SEND, EDS) demonstrated increased Li extraction selectivity post seeding, exhibiting a strong correlation with the fraction of high Li solid solution phase (e.g., LixFePO4 0.5\u2264x\u02c21). The high Li solid state phases prevented Na intercalation and remained intact even after pure Na intercalation.",
