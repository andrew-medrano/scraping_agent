    "ip_description": "Duke researchers have developed an innovative multi-specific antibody-based method to enhance immune responses against solid tumors. This approach involves the simultaneous targeting of phosphatidylserine (PS), a lipid component that signals cellular distress, and immune cell activators like CD3 or CD16. PS, typically confined to the inner membrane in healthy cells, flips to the outer membrane in dying and cancerous cells, serving as an \"eat me\" signal. While it has typically been assumed that PS-expressing tumor cells are destined to die from apoptosis, emerging evidence suggests that some tumor cells can escape the apoptosis cascade. By preventing these PS-positive cells from escaping cytotoxic stress, this therapy enhances the effectiveness of traditional cancer therapies. Immune effector cells (T cells, NK cells, NKT cells, or macrophages) armed with this antibody can simultaneously target PS-expressing tumor cells and activate immune cells via CD3/CD16 receptors. The inventors have also developed an additional therapeutic peptide in which a third tumor neoantigen can be targeted in addition to PS and CD3/CD16. These antibody-based treatments can be delivered either directly or via adoptive cell therapy. The efficacy of this approach has been demonstrated in human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines co-cultured with human T cells.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Duke researchers have developed **Temporally Dependent Iterative Expansion (TEDIE)**, an innovative tool designed to reconstruct the full path of a seizure as it spreads through the brain. TEDIE helps epileptologists more accurately identify the EZ, including the seizure source location and its size, enabling better evaluation of surgical candidacy and selection of surgical targets. TEDIE operates by combining patient-specific brain imaging with sEEG recordings. Its novel algorithm dynamically models changes in neural activity during a seizure, iteratively optimizing the location and magnitude of activity over time. For each timepoint, TEDIE generates a seizure source likelihood map tailored to the patient\u2019s geometry, which, when combined, creates a dynamic \u201cmovie\u201d of seizure propagation. TEDIE also includes an automated sEEG planning feature that calculates and visualizes the sensitivity of sEEG electrodes on brain tissue, and optimizes electrode trajectories to minimize invasive implants while maintaining recording accuracy. In clinical applications with data from 46 epilepsy patients at Duke University Medical Center and the University of Pennsylvania, TEDIE demonstrated: * Accurate identification of EZs in patients who became seizure-free post-surgery. * The ability to predict whether a patient would benefit from surgery and the type of surgery required. * Identification of new surgical targets for patients previously deemed non-surgical candidates. Compared to existing algorithms like sLORETA and IRES, TEDIE produced more accurate, focal, and interpretable seizure reconstructions. For sEEG planning, TEDIE optimized electrode placement to map more brain cortex with the same number of electrodes or the same amount of cortex with fewer electrodes than manual configurations. Other Applications: * Extending TEDIE\u2019s capabilities to conventional EEG could reduce the need for invasive sEEG and make advanced seizure mapping more accessible, especially in non-specialist epilepsy centers. * TEDIE\u2019s brain activity mapping technology could also support basic neuroscience research. Advantages: * Accurately reconstructs seizures for precise EZ identification, outperforming existing algorithms. * First-in-class automated sEEG planning tool that optimizes electrode placement and improves localization accuracy. * Standardized, quantitative, and computational tool for clinician decision-making. * Enhances patient safety and improves surgical outcomes through better sEEG planning and EZ localization. * Delivers personalized care based on patient-specific brain geometry.",

There is a growing need for systems that can integrate into mobile health (mHealth) applications, empowering individuals to better understand their environments, mitigate behavioral triggers, and promote healthier outcomes through tailored feedback. Duke inventors have developed a computer vision system that predicts behavioral risks based on images of users' environments. This system can be integrated into digital therapeutic applications to help individuals identify high-risk settings, such as those that may trigger stress, smoking, or insomnia, and suggest modifications to reduce these risks.

While techniques like forward error correction (FEC) add redundant bits to detect and correct transmission errors, existing decoding processes such as bounded-distance decoding (BDD) can misinterpret correct codewords as errors, leading to miscorrections. Methods like extrinsic message-passing help mitigate this issue, but they require increased data flow and storage, which are not ideal for high-speed systems. There is a need for a more efficient and reliable decoding process to minimize miscorrections effectively while maintaining low complexity.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a novel iterative decoding algorithm for component-based codes, including Generalized Product Codes (GPCs) and staircase codes. This technology is intended for use in high-speed communication systems, particularly in optical transport networks (OTNs) and other cost-sensitive applications. The algorithm improves bounded-distance decoding by detecting and preventing miscorrections and implementing error backtracking during the decoding process. Simulations show that this approach significantly reduces the error floor and delivers nearly ideal performance, preventing miscorrections and providing an additional coding gain of approximately 0.4 dB at a post-FEC bit error rate, outperforming conventional decoding techniques. The algorithm has been demonstrated through simulations and offers significant improvements with minimal additional development required.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   **Reduces miscorrection impact:** Minimizes undetected errors in component codes.\n*   **Superior performance:** Improves decoding accuracy with an additional coding gain of 0.4 dB.\n*   **Low complexity:** Maintains efficiency for high-speed systems without increasing data flow or storage requirements.",

    "ip_description": "An estimated 20% of all cancer patients will develop brain metastases in their lifetime. These metastases are first diagnosed by neuroradiologists using CT, and more commonly, MR imaging. If a limited number of brain metastases are present, patients often then undergo treatment by radiation oncologists using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), a highly precise, targeted treatment to individual metastases that spares normal brain tissue. However, both neuroradiologists and radiation oncologists face a difficult task in detecting and identifying all metastatic disease, particularly small brain metastases that evade the naked eye. Indeed, studies have shown that even expert neuroradiologists fail to detect 25-70% of metastases smaller than 3mm in MR images. Thus, small brain metastases are frequently overlooked, leading to growth, symptom development, and potentially additional treatments.\n\nComputer aided detection (CAD) can potentially augment human performance in this task, as evidenced by studies investigating the improvement in cancer detection in the brain and other sites. However, previously developed CAD systems for brain metastases have exhibited limitations, including a high false positive rate, and especially an inability to consistently detect small metastases. Additionally, the current standard of care in radiation treatment planning and diagnostic imaging review does not incorporate CAD of brain metastases as part of their respective software programs.\n\nThus, we believe there is a need for 1) an improvement in computer aided detection performance, specifically in the detection of small brain metastases, and 2) the incorporation of this technology into radiation treatment planning and diagnostic imaging software as part of routine clinical practice.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a novel computer aided detection system with superior sensitivity and specificity for brain metastasis detection compared to existing algorithms, particularly for small metastases. This tool was developed by training and validating an ensemble of convolutional neural networks on a unique dataset containing post-contrast spoiled gradient (SPGR) MRIs of patients with brain metastases, which included a large number of small brain metastases initially overlooked by the treating physician but identified retrospectively (retrospectively identified metastases, or RIMs). The resulting CAD system has been demonstrated to have a sensitivity of 94% for prospectively identified metastases (PIMs), and 80% for RIMs, while maintaining a low false positive rate of 2 per patient, and high segmentation accuracy. For all PIMs and treatable RIMs combined, the size-stratified detection performance in the same study was 100% (> 6 mm), 90% (3-6 mm), and 79% (< 3 mm), superior to prior published results from other studies with a similarly low false positive rate, especially for very small lesions.\n\nWhile our algorithm demonstrated the ability to detect and autosegment brain metastases in MR scans employed by radiation oncologists for radiation treatment planning, the MR training data employed diagnostic imaging scans from multiple different MR manufacturers and models, thus it might also improve the performance of neuroradiologists who face similar difficulty in the detection of small, subtle brain metastases during diagnostic imaging review. Finally, the same CNN architecture might be useful for the detection and segmentation of other intracranial tumors, provided it was trained and validated on a corresponding data set.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Superiority: Improvement in small brain metastases detection compared to prior algorithms\n* Simplicity: Use of a single MRI sequence\n* Sensitivity: 80% of +DC RIMS (not detected and treated prospectively by the initial treating physician but retrospectively meeting diagnostic criteria for positive identification as metastatic disease)\n* Specificity: low false positive rate of approximately 3 metastases per 3D MR volume\n* High autosegmentation accuracy",

    "ip_description": "Duke inventors have developed a depth-resolved spectroscopic imaging system designed to enhance the early detection and diagnosis of cancerous tissues. This is intended to be used by clinicians during endoscopic procedures to provide real-time feedback on tissue health, helping to identify abnormal polyps or signs of dysplasia without the need for physical biopsies. By enabling immediate assessment within existing endoscopic workflows, this technology could help reduce the need for follow-up procedures and lower pathology costs, improving patient outcomes. Specifically, this system combines the spectroscopic optical coherence tomography (sOCT) system with advanced analysis algorithms to enable high-resolution, depth-resolved imaging and precise tissue characterization. The sOCT system utilizes a dual-window processing method to capture both spectral and temporal information, overcoming limitations found in traditional OCT by achieving enhanced clarity and reduced artifacts. This dual-window approach allows clinicians to view detailed scattering and absorption properties of tissue at various depths, which are crucial for identifying early-stage abnormalities. The analysis algorithms process the sOCT data to reveal subtle tissue differences by examining scattering properties, such as attenuation and scattering power, which are reliable indicators of dysplasia or malignancy. This has been demonstrated at an advanced prototype stage, validated through ex vivo studies on human colon and esophageal tissues, where it successfully differentiated between healthy and abnormal tissue types with high accuracy. This technology could also be used in detecting and monitoring dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus, early detection of epithelial cancers across various organs, real-time imaging guidance during endoscopic procedures, and screening for gastrointestinal cancers, including stomach and pancreatic cancers. It may also be useful for assessing burn injuries and non-invasive analysis of skin conditions to detect abnormalities below the surface. Advantages include providing real-time, depth-resolved feedback during endoscopic procedures, allowing immediate assessment of at-risk tissues, reducing the need for invasive biopsies, lowering patient discomfort and associated costs, and enhancing diagnostic accuracy with sensitive, non-invasive imaging that captures both structural and functional tissue information.",

Pressure-clamp electrophysiology is widely used to study mechanotransduction, but force-gated ion channels respond directly to membrane tension rather than pressure. To recover tension measurements, current methods utilize differential interference contrast (DIC) imaging that requires labor-intensive manual analysis of membrane curvature, limiting accuracy, reproducibility, and preventing tension measurement in real time. There is a clear need for a system that can automatically monitor and control membrane tension to enable more accurate and efficient study of mechanosensitive components.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a fully integrated, closed-loop system that automatically manipulates membrane tension in real time.

Approximately 1 in 10 of Americans will experience a kidney stone in their lifetime. Small stones usually pass on their own with the help of fluids, pain management, and medical expulsive therapy, where medication encourages stone passage. However, 10-20% of cases require surgical intervention to assist with stone clearance. Laser lithotripsy, a commonly used surgical method, breaks down stones through photothermal ablation and the collapse of cavitation bubbles. These bubbles are generated by the high-intensity laser, and their collapse generates shockwaves that damage the stone. An imaging method called passive cavitation mapping (PCM) uses the shockwaves to detect and map cavitation bubbles within the kidney. However, PCM\u2019s inherent limitations in acoustic diffraction reduce the spatiotemporal resolution required for precise targeting which can lead to adverse events such as ineffective treatment outcome and damage to surrounding tissues. There is a need for improved three-dimensional, high resolution cavitation mapping methods to enhance the safety and effectiveness of stone treatment, minimizing complications and improving patient outcomes.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a 3D cavitation detection method to enhance intracorporeal laser lithotripsy. This is intended to be used with existing cavitation mapping interfaces to provide real-time feedback on laser and pulse positioning, maximizing stone ablation while minimizing harm to adjacent tissue. Specifically, this method achieves 3D super-resolution passive cavitation mapping (3D-SRPCM) with a field of view 8 mm in diameter and automatic robotic tracking of the cavitation events. It offers sub-pixel accuracy of 40 \u03bcm and a temporal resolution of 0.128 \u03bcs.

    "ip_description": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting approximately 10 million people globally and 1 million in the U.S. PD is characterized by involuntary movements such as tremors, stiffness, and coordination challenges, which progressively worsen, severely impacting a patient\u2019s quality of life. In addition to motor symptoms, PD can also lead to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional difficulties. Despite current treatments aimed at managing symptoms, there is currently no effective therapy that prevents or halts the progression of the disease. The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein (encoded by the SNCA gene) are key drivers of PD. Elevated SNCA levels contribute to neuronal death, making it a validated therapeutic target. However, excessive reduction of SNCA can lead to neurotoxicity, necessitating precise regulation of SNCA expression in affected neurons. There is a need for a targeted, gene-editing approach to precisely regulate SNCA expression in dopaminergic neurons, offering a disease-modifying therapy that avoids harmful side effects.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a therapeutic gene-editing system designed to target Parkinson\u2019s disease. This is intended to be a disease-modifying therapy focused on treating PD diseases driven by SNCA dysregulation. Specifically, this therapeutic employs a novel epigenome-editing approach to selectively reduce SNCA expression in dopamine neurons, which are primarily affected in PD. By precisely targeting SNCA in these neurons, this therapeutic offers the potential to halt or even reverse disease progression. SNCA dysregulation is a key driver of dopamine neuron death, leading to the motor symptoms characteristic of PD. Unlike traditional treatments, which only manage symptoms, this therapy directly addresses the root cause of neuronal degeneration. It uses a gene-editing mechanism that ensures SNCA is precisely regulated within dopamine neurons without affecting other neuron types, maintaining the normal physiological functions required for brain health. This has been demonstrated through preclinical studies, where SNCA downregulation showed significant potential to prevent or even reverse dopamine neuron death in vivo. This represents a first-in-class disease-modifying therapy capable of altering the progression of PD, a breakthrough in a field where no such treatments currently exist.\n\nThis technology could also be applied to other neurodegenerative disorders where SNCA dysregulation plays a role, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Lewy body disease (LBD), and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA).\n\nAdvantages:\n* Precisely targets SNCA expression in dopamine neurons, reducing off-target effects and ensuring specificity\n* Offers the first disease-modifying therapy that may slow or stop Parkinson's disease progression\n* Minimizes side effects by avoiding over-reduction of SNCA levels, protecting healthy neurons",

Mask embedding allows for user input in defining organs and other structures that should be present in the image.

    "ip_description": "Every year, close to 1 million Americans experience a heart attack. A heart attack results in the loss of specialized cells called cardiomyocytes, which are crucial for the heart\u2019s contraction and rhythmic beating. Cardiomyocyte depletion increases the risk of heart failure. Consequently, researchers have prioritized ways to replenish the cardiomyocyte population. Despite significant efforts, no method for replenishing the cardiomyocyte population has reached the clinic. Thus, there is a clear need for interventions that can boost the population of cardiomyocyte cells in patients following cardiac arrest.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a novel method to convert fibroblasts within the heart attack scar into cardiomyocytes. They uniquely achieve this via a combination of RNA molecules called miR combo. The critical issue is one of delivery. Up until this point, researchers and commercial entities have focused solely on viruses as the delivery vehicle. Viruses are problematic because they cannot hold much material and they generally lack cell specificity. This lack of specificity is particularly concerning in clinical settings, as it increases the risk of harmful off-target effects. Motivated by this concern, the Duke inventors developed a unique delivery approach involving exosomes. Specifically, they identified that exosomes derived from C166 cells targeted scar fibroblasts to the exclusion of all other cell-types. When compared to viral delivery approaches, C166-derived exosome delivery of miR combo resulted in significant improvements in reprogramming efficacy as well as functional recovery in a mouse myocardial infarction injury model.\n\nFibroblasts can differentiate into many different cell types including adipocytes (fat cells), hepatocytes (liver cells), osteocytes (bone cells), endothelial cells, and epithelial cells. As such, this technology could be applied to many other diseases that are defined by fibrosis/tissue injury. Examples of such diseases include end stage liver disease, kidney disease, lung scarring from infections, as well as fibrosis from autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, lupus, and Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nAdvantages:\n* C166-derived exosomes specifically target scar fibroblasts.\n* More effective than current strategies: viral approaches typically increase ejection fraction, a measure of cardiac function, by 5-10%.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Fungal infections are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide, with 150 million cases and 1.7 million fatalities reported in the last year alone. The challenge in treating these infections stems from the rise of multi-drug-resistant fungi, which makes conventional antifungal therapies less effective. Moreover, developing antifungals that don\u2019t have significant side effects or cross-reactivity is difficult due to the genetic similarities between humans and fungi. FK506 and FK520 are powerful antifungals that work by inhibiting a fungal protein called calcineurin. Unfortunately, they also inhibit human calcineurin, leading to immune suppression when administered. As a result, FK506 and FK520 are not ideal for managing the rising tide of fungal infections. There is a critical need for antifungal therapies that are highly specific to fungal targets and come with minimal side effects.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a series of small molecule analogs based on FK506 and FK520 that offer enhanced specificity for fungal calcineurin while minimizing immunosuppressive side effects. This is intended for more effective treatment of fungal infections, without inducing immune suppression, even at high doses. Previous efforts to design fungal-specific calcineurin inhibitors primarily targeted modifications at residue C18. However, recent studies have uncovered the significant role that C21/C22 residues play in calcineurin interactions. Building on this knowledge, Duke researchers synthesized a library of 15 novel C22- or C18-modified analogs of FK506 and FK520. Among these, two compounds\u2014PAD-008 and JH-FK-08\u2014exhibited superior specificity for fungal calcineurin compared to their parent compound, JH-FK-05, an FK506 analog. The enhanced selectivity of these analogs is primarily attributed to modifications at the C22 residue, which effectively prevent cross-reactivity with human calcineurin, thereby avoiding the immunosuppressive effects commonly associated with FK506 and FK520. The antifungal efficacy of JH-FK-08 and PAD-008 has been confirmed through both in vitro and in vivo studies, particularly in mouse models of Cryptococcus neoformans infection.\n\nIn addition to their direct antifungal capabilities, these small molecules serve as a foundation for further drug discovery. They can be chemically modified to create additional antifungal compound libraries aimed at developing more potent and selective therapeutics.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Increased specificity to Cryptococcus neoformans calcineurin compared to FK520.\n* Reduced immunosuppressive activity compared to FK520.\n* Greater efficacy in reducing fungal burden in infected mice versus FK520.\n* Ability to be chemically derived into novel compounds, potentially leading to the development of additional antifungal agents.",

It is intended to be administered to patients with solid tumors, including late-stage patients who have not responded well to other therapies and patients who need multiple treatments over time, to achieve anti-cancer therapeutic effects through the stimulation of the patients' innate immune response. Specifically, activation of RIG-I and inhibition of miR-21 leads to the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines in both cancer and immune cells. Among the immune cells, dendritic cells are stimulated, T cells are recruited, and the population of immuno-suppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) is reduced. These responses induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) in the cancer cells. This has been demonstrated _in vivo_ in the mouse model system. Intra-tumoral injection of RigantmiR-21 significantly increased cancer cell death and improved the survival of tumor-bearing mice compared with conventional RIG-I agonists. Repeated treatments continued to be effective, unlike conventional RIG-I agonists. Additionally, the combination of RigantmiR-21 and IFN-b priming improved anti-cancer responses in the particularly stubborn P53-/-, Rb-/- mouse head and neck cancer cells, which are resistant to conventional RIG-I agonists. Furthermore, RigantmiR-21 synergized with the anti-PD-1 antibody in the treatment of mouse sarcoma, demonstrating that RigantmiR-21 sensitizes tumors to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. The inventors' PRR agonist and miRNA antagonist hybrid design can target other PRRs besides RIG-I, including Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), Melanoma Differentiation Associated Protein -5 (MDA5), Laboratory of Genetics and Physiology 2 (LPG2), RNA-activated Protein Kinase (PKR), Nucleotide-binding Oligomerization Domain-containing Protein 2 (NOD2), and Nacht Leucine-rich Protein 3 (NALP3), as well as other miRNAs besides miR-21, including miR-146a. RigantmiR-21 could potentially treat liquid tumors, since miR-21 has been shown to be the most commonly upregulated miRNA in solid and hematological malignancies. The inventors' design could also be used as anti-infection, anti-viral agents. Advantages include: First-in-class therapeutic that combines both PRR activation and anti-microRNA therapy for sustained efficacy across repeated treatment; Stability: resistant to nuclease degradation; Safety: few noncancerous cells are sensitive to RIG-I agonists; Broadly effective: on a variety of solid and hematological cancers including those resistant to conventional RIG-I agonists; Synergistic with other immunotherapies and treatment modalities.",

    "ip_description": "Duke inventors, collaborating with the Vaccine Research Center (NIAID, NIH), have developed novel broadly neutralizing antibody variants with best-in-class neutralization breadth and potency for HIV-1. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can be dosed infrequently and limit the virus\u2019s ability to escape by mutation because they neutralize multiple viral strains. This is intended to be used as a treatment or prophylaxis for HIV-1, with less stringent compliance requirements and fewer side effects than existing options. Specifically, these novel variants improve neutralization breadth from 39% to 54% at clinically relevant concentrations and improve median potency by up to 4-fold over a cross-clade panel of 208 strains ([Cell Reports, Holt et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112711)). Potency was increased over 100-fold against some resistant viruses. This was accomplished using [OSPREY](https://donaldlab.cs.duke.edu/osprey.php), a suite of free and open-source protein design programs developed by Dr. Bruce Donald, to predict mutations for improved antibody affinity. These significant gains in bNAb efficacy were attained in the PGT145 and PG9RSH antibody classes, which are already among the broadest and most potent HIV-1 antibodies thus far identified. Significantly, this has been demonstrated in live HEK and HeLa cells derived from human patients. These same assays have previously been shown to predict bNAb efficacy against viral infection in live monkeys ([Rudicell et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1128%2FJVI.02213-14)).

    "ip_description": "Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), or cellular immunotherapy, uses immune cells to combat cancer. Since 2017, CAR-T therapies have been rapidly adopted for hematological malignancies. However, for treating solid tumors, which account for 90% of adult cases, TIL therapy is emerging as the most promising due to its broad antigen recognition and lower complexity. In TIL therapy, tumor-recognizing immune cells are harvested, cultured in vitro, and reintroduced to the patient. The efficacy of this approach hinges on the in vitro expansion of cytotoxic lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ T cells, highlighting the need for methods to enhance their proliferation and activation during TIL expansion for optimal therapeutic outcomes.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a method to stimulate the proliferation and activation of CD8+ T cells by targeting a novel immune checkpoint, specifically the complement-IL-10 pathway. This approach is intended for use in treating various cancers, including solid tumors, lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma. While IL-10 typically inhibits most immune cells, it uniquely activates CD8+ T cells. Normally, CD8+ T cells remain inactive because they produce complement, which inhibits IL-10. By inhibiting complement signaling or exposing CD8+ T cells to IL-10, these cells can be activated. This has been demonstrated in patient-derived tumor explants and mouse models, showing increased proliferation and tumor-killing ability of CD8+ T cells. Additionally, combining this method with PD1-PDL1 pathway blockade has shown synergistic antitumor effects.\n\nThis technology could also be applied as a combination therapy with various other cancer treatments including complement inhibitors, chemotherapy agents, kinase inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, _in vivo_ activation of CD8+ T cells by IL-10 can be accomplished using fusion proteins.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Synergizes with existing cancer treatments\n* Complement inhibition produces IL-10 at the tumor site, avoiding toxic effects of systemic IL-10 administration.\n* Optimal cellular immunotherapy for treating solid tumors\n* Increases CD8+ cell proliferation, effectiveness, and tumor killing ability",

Despite its importance, very little data is gathered describing open surgery. Surgical technique is more of an art than a science, with residents receiving predominantly peer-to-peer tutoring with subjective and variable feedback. Resulting significant variation in cost and patient outcomes motivate the development of sensing technologies to identify methods of surgery. RFID systems are currently the preferred method for tracking surgical instruments during operations. RFID can determine which instruments are used when, but understanding how instruments move is still a challenge. Imprecision in RFID communication parameters make positional localization impossible without machine learning and large training datasets. Duke inventors have developed a system for generating large artificial datasets that can be used to pretrain algorithms that predict location from RFID parameters. This technology is intended to be used to generate large, labeled training datasets to inform RFID tracking systems used in surgical operation.

Mobile devices such as smartphones typically include GPS for navigation and displaying a device\u2019s position on a map. However, localization of small or time-varying events has yielded poor accuracy. Accordingly, there is a need for improved systems that quickly and efficiently define the geographic position of events or objects near the user. Researchers at Duke have developed a mobile application that enhances the localization of real-world objects, events, and behaviors through user interaction and mobile sensing. The system determines the geographic position and orientation of a device, allowing users to define the location of an object or event with a simple swipe on the touchscreen. By tracking the direction and distance indicated by the user\u2019s gesture in relation to the device\u2019s position, the application provides accurate localization even for events that users cannot approach closely. This method aggregates data from multiple users, enhancing localization accuracy through crowdsourcing.

There is a need for resins that can be printed without the use of these solvents.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a biologically resorbable resin that can be 3D printed without the use of any solvent or diluent. The resin has a low viscosity, making it possible to use in current DLP printing systems. The resulting material has a demonstrated shrinkage of only 0.3%, reducing typical warping and cracking of printed parts. Additionally, polymerization and crosslinking of the resin is tunable, allowing for control of printed material mechanical properties. The mechanical properties of this resin have been assessed, and it is ready for use in developing medical implants.\n\nIn addition to creating implantable medical devices, this resin has potential for applications in drug delivery, nanotechnology, wearable electronics, microfluidics, and robotics.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Does not require any solvent or diluent\n* Printed material only shrinks 0.3%\n* Tunable mechanical properties\n* No toxic manufacturing materials\n* Ready for use in DLP and stereolithography systems",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Delayed-enhancement MRI (DE-MRI) is the standard for imaging myocardial infarction (MI), providing high-resolution maps of infarcted and viable myocardium. However, DE-MRI often suffers from poor differentiation between infarcted myocardium and the bright left ventricular (LV) blood-pool after contrast administration. This overlap can obscure infarcts, leading to missed diagnoses in certain patients, such as those with non-Q-wave chronic MI. This highlights the need for improved imaging techniques that can better distinguish between infarcted tissue and adjacent blood-pool.\n\nDr. Raymond Kim has developed a novel MRI technique called flow-independent dark-blood delayed-enhancement MRI (FIDDLE) that addresses this challenge. FIDDLE improves the visualization of infarcted myocardium by effectively suppressing the blood-pool signal. This is accomplished by a unique pulse sequence that includes a preparatory section designed to modify the organ tissue signal differently than the blood pool signal, followed by an inversion pulse. This sequence leverages the distinct relaxation times of tissue and blood, allowing the MRI signals to evolve separately, resulting in clear separation and suppression of the blood-pool signal without dependence on blood flow speed. This approach allows for clear separation and suppression of the blood-pool signal, providing superior diagnostic performance for detecting myocardial infarction compared to conventional DE-MRI. For more details see the left-hand side of the page for links to the issued U.S. patent and publication.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Enhances the visualization of infarcted myocardium by suppressing the blood-pool signal, addressing the issue of poor differentiation in traditional DE-MRI.\n* Insensitive to blood flow characteristics, ensuring consistent suppression of blood-pool signal even in slow or stagnant blood pools.\n* Offers improved diagnostic accuracy and decision-making in MI evaluation, advancing the standard for both clinical practice and research.",

    "ip_description": "Genetically based metabolic disorders affect 1 in 2500 births globally and many of these disorders result in an enzyme deficiency. In most cases, a single enzyme is not produced by the body at all, in not enough quantities to keep a patient healthy, or it is produced in a form that doesn\u2019t work. Depending on the specific enzyme that is missing, toxic by-products can build up inside cells, causing nerve damage, developmental delay, kidney and heart disease, severe disabilities, or premature death. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a common medical treatment for these cases, in which the patient receives purified human, animal, or recombinant enzyme preparations to replace a missing or deficient enzyme through intravenous infusions. While ERT can allow patients to live relatively normal lives, sometimes the enzyme being provided to the patient is recognized as foreign by the patient\u2019s immune system, causing anaphylaxis, severe hypersensitive reactions, or reducing the therapeutic effect of the treatment during their infusion due to elevated enzyme specific antibody titers. Therefore, there is a need for a method to prevent the development of or remove existing pathogenic antibodies in patients receiving ERT for metabolic diseases where this therapy is the standard of care.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a method for inducing tolerance for patients receiving ERT for a variety of metabolic diseases. This is intended to be used in conjunction with ERT to induce tolerance or to remove existing antibodies against the functional enzyme being infused. Specifically, Duke inventors discovered a method of inducing tolerance using in combination or alone rituximab, methotrexate, intravenous gamma globulin, or bortezomib. This has been demonstrated to prevent antibody production in patients that did not produce any of their own enzyme and those that produced some but not enough (or a deficient version) of it. Further, this has been demonstrated to reduce antibody titers in patients with pre-existing antibodies against the enzyme. This immune tolerance induction method can be used for the treatment with ERT of metabolic diseases including Fabry Disease, Gaucher Disease, GSDs types I-VIII, IX, XI, XII, and XIII, cardiac glycogenesis due to AMP-activated protein kinase gamma subunit 2 deficiency, MPS diseases including MPS I (Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, or Scheie Syndrome), MPS II (Hunter Disease), and MPS VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome), Pompe Disease, or Wolman disease.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Can be used in conjunction with ERT therapy with options for oral, subcutaneous, or intravenous administration\n* Can be used to tolerize patients that do not produce any enzyme\n* Can be used on patients that have established antibodies\n* Prevents the formation of antibodies in na\u00efve patients",

This is intended to be offered as optimization software integrated with MRI operating systems to provide improved imaging protocols for the detection of fatty tissue infiltration. Specifically, a common signal approach called steady state free precession (SSFP) is utilized to merge induced and echoed MRI detected pulses into a continuous signal with varying amplitude. This has been demonstrated to provide high-resolution imaging of fatty tissue with highly sensitive specificity such that even partial infiltration of fatty tissue can be detected among surrounding healthy tissue. This method has been shown specifically for detection of myocardial fatty metaplasia in 50 patients undergoing clinical cardiac MRI.\n\nThis technology could also be applied to other clinical imaging applications throughout the body in which the detection and differentiation of fatty tissue from surrounding tissue is critical.

Liver steatosis occurs in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as well as rare diseases such as glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I). Current standard of care focuses on ameliorating symptoms or making lifestyle changes which cannot correct the underlying problem. More recently, gene therapies have been developed for rare diseases, including GSD I. However, these gene therapies have had varying levels of success and are often plagued by dosing issues and lack of durability. Any gene therapy administered to patients with NAFLD or NASH, affecting cumulatively up to 25% of the US population, would face similar issues. This includes gene therapies for conditions unrelated to NAFLD or NASH, given their high prevalence. There is a clear need for a gene therapy regimen that is accessible to patients with liver steatosis from any cause.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a treatment method that is designed to reduce lipid accumulations in the liver. This is intended to be used to treat steatosis-associated diseases including GSD I, as well as other inherited liver disorder in a patient who also has NAFLD or NASH. Specifically, this treatment method is comprised of an autophagy inducing agent, a lysosomal enzyme, or both. In steatosis-associated diseases there is an influx of triglycerides into the liver and autophagy, or degradation, of these triglycerides is impaired. Duke inventors investigated whether inducing autophagy of lipid stores would lead to improved metabolism in a GSD I background. They demonstrated that pharmacological induction of autophagy can lead to a correction in hepatic fat levels both _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ models of GSD Ia.\n\nThis technology could also be used as an adjuvant therapy to reduce dosage requirements for gene therapy or mRNA therapy in patients with NAFLD or NASH, or steatosis-associated rare diseases such as GSD I.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Targeted treatment that avoids the pitfalls of AAV based gene therapy\n* Treats a root cause of disease rather than symptoms\n* Combination therapy is comprised of drugs that are already FDA approved for other uses",

Digital microfluidics (DMF) pioneers an appealing solution for economical automation by programmable manipulation of nano- to pico-liter droplets on a miniaturized chip using electro-wetting forces.\n\nAlthough numerous liquid handling techniques technologies (_e.g._, microfluidic chips and micro-well plates) have been developed, they generally rely on physical contact with a solid structure in order to contain, transport, or manipulate liquid reagents. This leads to the lack of fluid rewritability, and the associated benefits of multi-path routing and re-programmability, due to surface-adsorption-induced contamination on contacting structures. In addition, most current platforms are based on disposable, on-time use devices. Those features greatly limits the processing-speed, integration-scale, and complexity of reaction logics for liquid handling on a same device.\n\nThe present invention describes a system of unique contactless droplet-processing technique, Digital Acoustofluidics (DAF), which can digitally manipulate aqueous droplets (from 1nL to 100\u03bcL volumes) floating on a denser fluorinert oil horizontally _via_ acoustic-streaming-induced hydrodynamic traps.

The standard treatment for sepsis includes source control, general antibiotics, and supportive care, but attempts to develop a specific treatment for sepsis have been unsuccessful. The failure of sepsis therapies is thought to be due to patient differences and the lack of tools to accurately categorize sepsis at the molecular level. Although clinical severity scores and blood lactate levels are used for risk stratification, they do not adequately quantify the abnormal response displayed by patients. There is a need for a test that allows clinicians to molecularly define the microbial agents and assess the severity of the host response in sepsis.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a prognostic model to improve the prediction of sepsis mortality and enhance risk stratification for septic patients.

    "ip_description": "Bacterial infections can lead to various outcomes, with septicemia posing significant morbidity and mortality risks for patients. Septicemia occurs when bacteria enter and spread through the bloodstream, triggering an extreme immune response in the host body. If not promptly and effectively treated, septicemia can result in septic shock and organ failure, which can be fatal in up to half of cases. Blood cultures are currently the standard for diagnosing bloodstream infections, but they have limitations in sensitivity and the speed of providing results. Diagnostic delays and uncertainties can have negative impacts on patient outcomes due to treatment effectiveness and the potential for inappropriate antibiotic usage. Research suggests that an alternative diagnostic approach could involve utilizing the host\u2019s immune response to identify the infecting pathogen. There is a need for a new, quicker approach capable of distinguishing between the major pathogens responsible for bacterial infections.\n\nDuke researchers have developed a new method for identifying biomarkers that are associated with specific types of bacteria. This innovative approach is intended to serve as an alternative diagnostic tool to rapidly identify patients suffering from bacterial infections. The researchers used both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to create a classifier that can distinguish between infected and healthy individuals. The classifiers are derived from changes in gene expression in peripheral blood cells, specifically related to the immune response of the infected individuals. To validate their classifiers, the researchers first studied mice with various types and levels of bacterial infections to identify the gene expression patterns in immune cells. After defining the characteristics of different infection types, they validated their findings in a group of human subjects. This research was the first to identify specific genetic biomarkers that are characteristic of two different types of bacterial infections.\n\nThis technology could also be used to monitor the progression of patients' immune response against bacterial infections.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Faster accurate approach to differentiate between pathogens causing bacterial infection.\n* Biomarkers detected in this invention are more sensitive than the current diagnostic standard for bacterial infection in identifying disease states.\n* Enhancement of patient outcomes by allowing optimal treatment more rapidly.",

A recent study estimates that ABR could cause nearly ten million deaths per year by 2050, surpassing cancer related deaths and could cost the global economy up to $100 trillion. Current therapies have seen increasing resistance rates in recent years. Gram-positive bacteria, in particular cocci strains (staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci), exhibit high rates of ABR. The rate of penicillin resistance in these strains is 85%, and multi-drug resistance 44%. Many naturally occurring compounds possess good antibiotic activity in vitro but fail to make the jump to drug candidates owing to poor stability, adsorption, toxicity, or routes of delivery. Modification of naturally occurring antibiotics provides the opportunity to develop second-generation versions that overcome these limitations, as exemplified by the semisynthetic glycopeptides telavancin, oritavancin, and dalbavancin.

    "ip_number": "T-006815",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Cancer is a serious health issue characterized by the abnormal growth of cells that invade and destroy healthy tissue. Nearly one in five human cancers features KRAS mutations, making it one of the most prevalent genetic mutations associated with cancer development. In healthy cells, KRAS serves as a crucial regulator of cell growth, acting as an on-off switch that inhibits growth proteins. However, when mutations occur, KRAS loses its ability to manage cell growth, resulting in uncontrolled growth leading to the development of cancer. The challenge of targeting the KRAS protein for cancer research and pharmaceutical treatment stems from its compact structure and lack of binding sites. Given KRAS's critical role in cancer development, there is need for a breakthrough that will enable its targeting.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a ligand to bind KRAS. This is intended to be a molecular switch designed to turn KRAS signaling off. Specifically, inventors redesigned the binding domain of c-RAF, an effector of KRAS, through the introduction of several point mutations. Their design resulted in tighter binding between this c-RAF-derived protein and KRAS, providing direct control over the cellular growth pathway regulated by this interaction. Notably, the redesigned KRAS ligand can be customized through conjugation with different molecules to modulate the outcome of the interaction, including the direct inhibition of KRAS. They demonstrated the effectiveness of their design by testing biomolecular kinetics in real-time using a biosensor method. This ligand represents a significant milestone as the first protein capable of modulating downstream effector signaling of KRAS, demonstrating great potential to revolutionize cancer study and treatment.\n\nThis technology could be used in cancer science for the discovery of novel cancer mechanisms, and the screening of antineoplastic drugs. Additionally, the novel ligand itself could be modified to become a drug to treat cancer.\n\nAdvantages:\n* First KRAS ligand that modulates downstream effector signaling.\n* Novel c-RAF effector-based ligand with the tightest binding ability to KRAS in its class.\n* Ligand can be conjugated to different compounds to modify its effects.\n* Direct targeting of KRAS offers an opportunity to control its cancer-causing potential.",

    "ip_description": "Dendritic cells (DCs) play a critical role in the adaptive immune response by capturing and presenting antigens to activate cytotoxic T-cells. As such, naturally occurring DCs are thought to have crucial antitumor activity and are an active area of exploration in cancer immunotherapy and vaccine development, including in osteosarcoma, lung, and breast cancers. Since the first DC vaccine entered the market in 2010, there have been increased interest and investment in these interventions, with a global market size of $593.30 million USD in 2022. In contrast to cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy, there are limited side effects and increased survival rates with DC-based immunotherapies. Monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) make up the current standard for DC-based immunotherapies because monocytes have a high prevalence in the blood compared to naturally occurring DCs, and MoDCs can be readily expanded for use in therapeutics. However, despite their improvement on other, non-DC cancer treatments, MoDCs are distinct from naturally occurring DCs and have demonstrated suboptimal results in T cell proliferation and migration to lymph organs. Alternatively, conventional type-1 DCs (cDC1) represent a more desirable DC subset given their superiority in CD8+ T-cell activation and ability to promote an inflamed tumor phenotype (i.e., \u201chot\u201d tumor), which are more responsive to immune-based therapies. Given the low prevalence of naturally occurring cDC1s in the blood, there is a clear and urgent need for a method to generate clinically tractable cDC1.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a novel procedure to produce conventional type-1 dendritic-like (cDC1-like) cells in vitro. These cells may be used as a research tool to better understand the role of cDC1s in cancer immunology and develop improved immunotherapies. Since cDC1 cells are not prevalent in high numbers in the blood naturally, this protocol would enable researchers to generate large quantities of these cells for study and delivery as therapeutics to patients. Specifically, this procedure differentiates a blood-derived CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells into cDC1-like cells using only the cytokines GM-CSF and FLT3L. This is an improvement over alternative protocols that use immortalized xenogeneic feeder cells to generate large numbers of cDC1-like cells. This protocol produces high yields of cDC1-like cells that express high levels of cDC1-specific markers, are responsive to TLR3 agonism, and have enhanced cross-presentation capabilities over Mo-DCs \u2013 all of which are hallmark features of cDC1. This has been demonstrated through in vitro tests of the protocol.\n\nThis technology could also be used in vaccine development and to study and develop cDC1-based cell therapies.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Generates high yield of cDC1-like cells\n* Produces cells that are responsive to TLR3 agonism and have superior antigen cross-presentation compared to MoDC cells\n* Amenable to antigen loading/mRNA transfection\n* Protocol requires only cytokines, making these cDC1s suitable for clinical application.",

    "ip_description": "Kidney transplant is the best current treatment for kidney failure. The kidney is the most common organ to be transplanted, and in 2019 there were 23,405 kidney transplants in the United States. Unfortunately, around 30% of patients who undergo kidney transplants develop acute rejection (AR) due to antibody mediated rejection and T-cell mediated rejection. AR is associated with significant decreased long-term allograft survival independent of patient age, as well as inflammation within areas of interstitial fibrosis and tubal atrophy. Immune monitoring to detect AR allows for early intervention and decreased graft damage, but diagnostic methods, particularly those relying on molecular signatures, are likely confounded by differences in the immunosuppressive strategies used, and these differences are non-uniformly distributed by recipient age. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need for improved early detection of AR.\n\nResearchers at Duke University have identified biomarkers that detect acute rejection of kidney transplants in both children and adults. This technology is intended to enable early intervention and decreased graft damage for patients who develop AR after a kidney transplant. Specifically, this is a set of eight genes observed in both kidney transplant biopsy and peripheral blood as differentially expressed between kidney transplant patients who are stable over two years and patients who developed AR. Importantly, this set of genes retained significance irrespective of immunosuppression regimen or recipient age and was significant after adjusting for clinical variables in the cohort, such as race, gender, age, and treatment. The gene set was validated as a variable diagnostic biomarker in 110 adult and pediatric kidney transplant patients who either experienced AR within one year or stable for at least six months.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Identifies acute rejection regardless of the immunosuppressive strategies used during patient treatment\n* Allows for non-invasive method of testing by using peripheral blood assay\n* Independent of age, unlike previous studies that separate adult patient samples and pediatric samples\n* Identifies peripheral signature of AR caused by both antibody mediated rejection and T-cell mediated rejection in patients",

The functionalized meshes have been shown to inhibit both nucleic acid and certain non-nucleic acid TLR ligands with minimal cytotoxicity.

    "ip_description": "Globally, over 15 million people are living with spinal cord injury as of 2021. Based on data from 2019, 0.9 million new cases emerged in a year. While most cases are due to trauma, spinal cord injury is a major cause of long-term disability, accounting for over 4.5 million years of life lived with disability in 2021. During rehabilitation, especially for high cervical injuries, where the neck structure is damaged, patients need to wear a brace that provides complete cervical immobilization for an extended period of time. However, the current standard of care for patients who are not surgical candidates, is an invasive brace that requires pins to be drilled into a patient\u2019s skull during application. The invasive brace is not only uncomfortable and unsafe for the patient \u2013 it covers a large surface area on the patient\u2019s body, has a high incidence rate of chest over-compression, and is known to cause additional complications such as skin infection, but the invasive brace is also demanding of the healthcare provider \u2013 specialized personnel, including a neurosurgeon, need to be present for the drilling application, not to mention the device is composed of many individual components that are time-consuming to assemble. Although a few non-invasive cervical braces exist, they are either not intended for complete cervical restriction, or mainly used on children with little data on adult patients. There is a need for a non-invasive cervical brace that is more versatile.\n\nDuke inventors have developed Spine Secure, a non-invasive cervical brace device, also known as a truncal orthosis, that is versatile enough to support the entire cervical spine of adult patients. Spine Secure is primarily intended to be used by healthcare providers to immobilize the patient\u2019s upper cervical spine (C1/C2) in the rehabilitation process for traumatic neck injury, preventing further damage and providing relief to the patient. Additionally, because Spine Secure stabilizes the entire cervical spine (C1-C7), it can be used in outpatient procedures such as stereotactic radiosurgery and high-frequency ultrasound treatment to maintain correct spine alignment. Similarly, Spine Secure can be used by emergency medical technicians and the military to replace traditional neck braces in emergencies, preventing further damage until proper treatment is provided. Specifically, Spine Secure has 3 main components: an adjustable headband, a torso brace with anchoring rods, and a back board. The design is favorable for manufacturers because it uses less material and has fewer pieces to assemble than existing braces. For healthcare providers, it is also quicker to assemble and easier to use, with features such as an exposed X-ray imaging area and one-key-fits-all-hinges. At the same time, Spine Secure maximizes patient comfort and safety \u2013 with low skin coverage, no chest compression, breathable material, adjustment mechanisms, and multiple sizes, the device accommodates patients of different body sizes and provides comfort when patients are sleeping on their back. Spine Secure uses a novel method to support the head and neck, which has been demonstrated to achieve 95% restriction of cervical extension, flexion, and left and right lateral bending in the average adult.\n\nThe distinct features of the Spine Secure device, such as the curved backplate and mesh padding, may find other applications in research, engineering and clinical settings.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Non-invasive and versatile\n* Eliminates the need for specialized personnel, broadening the administer-base to include any medical staff trained in maintaining cervical spine precautions and placing cervical collars, especially in emergencies outside of traditional hospital settings\n* Can be used for both upper cervical spine injury rehabilitation and more general cervical spine stabilization\n* Uses a novel method to support the head and neck, which has been demonstrated to be effective\n* Design is favorable for manufacturers and healthcare providers, while also maximizing patient comfort and safety\n* Invented by a team of experts who already have an IP strategy as well as plans for prototype development, manufacturing, regulatory approval and commercialization",

    "ip_description": "Necroptosis is a form of cell death characterized by the rapid loss of plasma membrane integrity, leading to the activation of the immune system and subsequent inflammation. This process has been implicated in several chronic inflammatory diseases including asthma, arthritis, autoimmune disorders, diabetes, and kidney disease among others. These chronic inflammatory diseases affect over 125 million people in the United States, with numbers projected to increase significantly over the next 30 years. Current therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases vary in their mechanism of action, often treating downstream signaling pathways rather than the underlying causes. Unfortunately, treatment failure is not uncommon. For example, more than 30% of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis fail first-line therapies and face challenges in finding effective treatments. There is a need for necroptosis inhibitors that can modulate inflammatory responses at the root cause. Developing these therapies can significantly improve disease outcomes and enhance quality of life for patients living with chronic inflammatory diseases.\n\nDuke inventors have developed an inhibitor of necroptosis by investigating a class of viruses that encode inhibitors of cell death. This is intended to be used by physicians alongside existing therapies for treating chronic inflammatory diseases. Specifically, inventors identified a viral inhibitor of necroptosis through an siRNA screen of cowpox infected cells. Previously, the inventors identified RIPK3 as a key regulator of necroptosis. Upon activation, RIPK3 undergoes a phosphorylation cascade that activates the pseudokinase MLKL, leading to membrane permeabilization, leakage, and subsequent inflammation. The newly identified inhibitor, termed Viral Inducer of RIPK3 Degradation (vIRD), binds to RIPK3 and confers resistance to necroptosis though RIPK3 ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. The inhibition of inflammation by vIRD was validated in vivo using mouse models of cowpox virus infection. Deletion of vIRD in these models resulted in reduced markers of inflammation, including decreased chemokine expression, immune cell recruitment, tissue injury, and viral replication. Taken together, the investigation of vIRD for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases may reduce inflammation and improve patient outcomes. Future research will need to focus on target validation and evaluate vIRD in the context of chronic inflammatory disease.\n\nThis technology could also be used in vaccine development to enhance immunogenicity and deliver safer, more efficacious vaccines to the clinic.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Novel class of necroptosis inhibitors to target the root cause of chronic inflammatory disease\n* Demonstrated in vivo validation of vIRD in reducing inflammation\n* Applicable to a wide variety of inflammatory conditions",

Alternatively, colonization with deleterious microbial species predicts poor gut health and increases the risk of obesity and metabolic disorders. Despite their importance to the health of their host, most intestinal microbes remain uncharacterized because they are not amenable to genetic manipulation and subsequent experimentation. As a result, the specific genes and molecules microbes use to alter host physiology are largely undiscovered. Therefore, there is a need for a non-genetic method to characterize the genes controlling traits of certain microbes within a community. Duke inventors have developed a method called Mutational Enrichment Analysis post phenotypic selection (MEAPS) to characterize the genes and bioactive compounds responsible for specific traits in microbes. This is intended to be used for the discovery of compounds for medical applications, additional drug targets to control bacterial infections, and new approaches to control dysbiosis of microbiomes. Specifically, MEAPS utilizes chemical mutagenesis, phenotypic selection, and population-based genome sequencing to identify genes associated with bacterial traits without species-specific genetic tools. This has been demonstrated in a proof-of-principle study that successfully characterized the relevant genes associated with motility in Exiguobacterium acetylicum, a poorly characterized gut bacterium. This technology could also be used for livestock and industrial applications, which often utilize microbial compounds. Advantages include enabling identification of genes responsible for certain traits even when the microbe is rare, understudied, or genetically intractable, allowing for functional characterization of genes identified, giving additional information about how the discovered gene contributes to the trait of interest, and the MEAPS method can be applied to any culturable bacterial species.",

    "ip_number": "T-007281",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Among types of brain cancer, glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and the most devastating. Over 8000 patients are diagnosed annually in the United States, accounting for half of all primary malignant brain tumors. Patients suffer from headaches, seizures, nausea, and memory loss; with an average survival of just 14 months following initial diagnosis. Tragically, there are no curative treatments for GBM. The current standard of care consists of maximal surgical resection, followed by radiation therapy and treatment with temozolomide, an alkylating agent. However, even when GBM tumors appear to be fully removed, they almost always come back within 6-8 months. This is due to their invasive nature, coupled with their characteristic treatment resistance. Surgery cannot eliminate invasive microscopic tendrils of the tumor which extend into healthy tissue and resist treatment. GBM treatment resistance is complex, but a major component is suppression of signaling pathways that detect damaged DNA and flag the cancerous cell for destruction by the immune system. Radiation therapy and alkylating agents induce DNA damage, but cancerous cells evade detection by the immune system by suppressing such pathways. There is an urgent need for a method to rescue cellular mechanisms of detecting DNA damage to enable better outcomes for GBM and other cancers.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a method to combat cancer cell evasion of the immune system, by de-suppressing signaling pathways that detect and report damaged DNA. This is intended to be used by a physician for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, allowing them to assess whether the pathway is suppressed, rescue this if necessary, and select the most effective treatment strategy. Specifically, the cGAS-STING pathway is responsible for detection of damaged DNA and flagging the cell for destruction by the immune system. This pathway is suppressed in GBM and other cancers by hypermethylation of the STING promoter. Administering Decitabine (demethylating agent) to the tumor can reverse this, enhancing the efficacy of conventional cancer treatments that utilize DNA damage (e.g. radiation therapy and alkylating agents) as well as immunotherapies. This is because rescuing STING function forces cancerous cells to signal their compromised status to the immune system, by expression of surface antigens that encourage their recognition and destruction by immune cells. Furthermore, STING activity promotes secretion of pro-inflammatory factors that activate T cells and Natural Killer cells. This has been demonstrated by analyzing STING mRNA and protein expression, using databases of GBM patient samples, cell culture assays of GBM cell lines, and fresh tumor tissue samples from GBM patients, before and after Decitabine treatment. These diverse experimental approaches provide convergent lines of evidence that affirm the efficacy of this method in enhancing immune detection of various cancer types including GBM. This technology could improve GBM patient outcomes by sensitizing cancerous cells to various treatments including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy.\n\nThis technology could also be applied to non-GBM cancer types that share the STING silencing mechanism, including extracranial tumors of neuronal origin. STING hypermethylation is also present in non-cancerous cerebral disease states including neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson diseases, neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, and psychiatric diseases such as bipolar and schizophrenia.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Improved treatment outcomes by overcoming cancer cell immunosuppression\n*   Predict treatment response and guide clinical strategy via STING epigenetic biomarker\n*   Transforms difficult to treat immunologically \u201ccold\u201d tumors into immunologically active tumors, sensitizing cancer to treatment",

    "ip_description": "Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer diagnosed among adult males, with the first line of treatment being androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, up to 20% of patients develop a resistance to ADT, and their disease progresses into Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), which has an average survival rate of two years if it becomes metastatic and spreads to other parts of the body. With the average cost of androgen deprivation therapy at $32,120 and treatments that can last up to three years, there is a need for a method of early detection of high-risk cancer types that are likely to develop resistance to hormone therapy so that providers can determine the best course of treatment for their patients. Duke inventors have developed a biomarker for prostate cancers with a high-risk of developing resistance to hormone therapy. Genetic counselors and other providers could use this technology to diagnose patients more effectively and to determine their prognosis. Specifically, the inventors have determined a novel evolutionary gene signature that is present in both CRPC and in some cell clusters in primary prostate cancers that are like CRPC. Providers could use this gene signature to stratify prostate cancer patients as low-risk or high-risk for developing resistance to hormone therapy and determine the best course of treatment for patient outcomes and quality of life. The inventors have demonstrated this through in vitro studies, where they sequenced cells from both primary prostate cancers and CRPCs, identified common genes that are up regulated in CRPC, metastatic prostate cancer, and resistant cell types in primary prostate cancer, and cross referenced this with clinical samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus. This technology fulfills the very specific use case of identifying CRPC, CPRC-like cells in primary prostate cancer, and metastatic prostate cancer. This gene signature could also potentially be used as the basis for a gene therapy. Advantages include: Can specifically detect potential CRPC or high-risk primary cancers at an early stage, Determine more effective courses of treatment for high-risk patients, Could increase patient quality of life by preventing an unsuccessful course of ADT and lower financial burden.",

It causes sustained or intermittent muscle contractions that make it painful for people perform tasks such as writing. Current commercial treatments for FHD include botulinum toxin injections and neurostimulator devices. New brain stimulation therapies are currently being researched as a treatment for FHD. However, these therapies can only be performed when patients are at rest. Following a treatment, evaluation techniques, such as the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia scale and writer\u2019s cramp rating scale, are used to measure the efficacy of an intervention. These evaluation techniques are highly susceptible to variability because it depends on a physician\u2019s ability to adequately rate a patient\u2019s symptoms. There is a need for comprehensive FHD treatment that improves a patient\u2019s symptoms, incorporates patient activity during treatment, and accurately evaluates the treatment efficacy.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a treatment for focal hand dystonia (FHD). This is intended to use neurostimulation, including evaluation techniques, to improve the quality-of-life for people with FHD. Specifically, the treatment uses repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to deliver magnetic pulses to the basal ganglia and cerebellum, deep regions of the brain responsible for motor control, motor learning, executive function, behaviors, and emotion. Inventors deliver rTMS at a 10 Hz frequency, a novel methodology in TMS treatments, and subjects perform writing tasks interleaved with the rTMS. This approach of alternating between task performance and TMS activates the subjects\u2019s brain motor network. To bypass limitations from current evaluation scales, the inventors use accessible kinematic and hand recognition software to automatically measure a subject\u2019s ability to perform writing tasks. The results of this treatment demonstrated that FHD subjects had reduced writing dysfluency, reduced cortical activity at the primary somatosensory and premotor cortical regions, reduced basal ganglia and increased cerebellar activity, and greater behavioral improvement. A preliminary study demonstrated that two key measures of the evaluation software distinguished FHD and were significantly correlated with other clinical determinants.\n\nAdvantages:\n- A non-surgical treatment procedure for FHD using rTMS\n- Personalized targeting using subjects own brain scan and electric field modeling\n- Automated measures for assessing FHD that can be used in clinical research settings and are consumer accessible.\n- Clinically proven to improve subject\u2019s ability to perform writing tasks.",

Three most important dimensions of psychological distress in MSK pain populations are fear avoidance, negative pain coping, and negative mood. Existing patient health questionnaires are not designed to efficiently discern between these 3 dimensions, which is important for making decisions about care. There is a need for questionnaires that can be used across a variety of musculoskeletal conditions to efficiently and accurately identify fear avoidance, negative pain coping, and negative mood.\n\nDuke inventors have developed 3 separate screening tools, corresponding to each of the 3 dimensions of psychological distress that are especially relevant in MSK populations. These tools can be used together or separately by health care providers to screen incoming patients with MSK pain and select a personalized treatment plan based on how a patient scores in each of the 3 dimensions. For example, people with high fear avoidance may benefit from psychologically-informed physical therapy that includes pain education, graded exposure/exercise, guided imagery, or cognitive behavioral-based activities. People scoring high in negative mood may require co-management with mental health or psychological counseling professionals to address factors such as depression, anxiety, and anger.\n\nSpecifically, the 3 tools were developed using a rigorous methodology informed by item response theory (IRT). This process allows these tools to be flexibly adapted to different lengths. This is simply not possible with most existing psychological questionnaires, which are only accurate if administered in their entirety. Each of the 3 tools is available in 2 formats, as a 4-item short form or a computer adaptive test (CAT). The CAT format selects questions based on the patient\u2019s response to prior questions. By tailoring the test to the individual, the CAT achieves a high degree of accuracy with as few questions as possible, typically 7-8 questions per psychological dimension. Selecting whether to use the short form or CAT formats depends on health system resources, clinical needs, and technological capabilities. Both formats can be integrated into the electronic health record system.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Developed specifically for patients with musculoskeletal pain conditions\n- Identify fear avoidance, negative pain coping, negative mood (comprehensive assessment)\n- Same tools can be used for different body regions (easy to administer) to\n- High reliability and accuracy with results (rigorous development methods)\n- Flexible length for item number and option for computer adaptive testing (multiple platforms)",

This has led for a push to have crops that express genes that make them resilient and high-quality producers. Technologies to help keep up with demand include artificial selection and genetic engineering. With genetic engineering, genes for desirable traits can be inserted from one plant into another. However, there is an optimal expression level of each transgene that is challenging to achieve, and suboptimal expression can impair crop resilience and yield. There is a need for a more precise control of gene expression to produce high quality crops. Duke inventors have developed a method to tightly control gene expression.

Statistics show the annual building energy cost is over $430 billion in the U.S. This causes serious problems to both our environment and economy. While there are several highly performing heating and cooling solutions with low carbon footprint, most of them focus on providing either heating solutions or cooling solutions. However, when one spans the climatic zones across the United States, one can see that more than 50% of places might requiring heating as well as cooling, albeit at different times of the year. Thus, this creates an unmet need for a high performance, energy-saving, flexible heating and cooling solution which can be manufactured at a low cost and can be integrated in the pre-existing systems.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a device that allows flexible switching between heating and cooling mode without affecting performance.

Whether on top of single family housing or in a grid miles long, solar energy\u2019s biggest advantage is that panels can be placed anywhere with a reasonable amount of sunlight. Energy harvesting becomes increasingly effective in environments with high amounts of sunlight. Deserts, such as the Mojave in the US, the Gobi in China, and the Sahara in Northern Africa, have been identified as ideal locations for solar energy due to the high amount of sunlight and relatively stable weather conditions. However, deserts provide a unique challenge to solar energy through dust buildup. Debris in the form of soil, dust, or sand can build up on the photovoltaic panels and lead to a 40% drop in energy efficiency. Current cleaning solutions for removing debris includes mechanical cleaning, anti-soiling coatings, and electrostatic removal. All these cleaning methods can reduce debris to restore energy collection, but have downsides \u2013 mechanical cleaning can damage the panels, anti-soiling coatings are difficult to manufacture and add substantial cost at limited effectivity, and electrostatic cleaning methods reduces overall power efficiency by up to 15%.

Due to its association with age, the incidence of heart failure, as well as the cost of treatment, is likely to grow. Therefore, there is increasing need for the ability to accurately predict the development of heart failure and asses the risk for major adverse cardiac events. Heart failure (HF) can be classified into two types: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The ejection fraction is a measure of the percentage of blood that is that is pumped from the left ventricle with each heartbeat. HFpEF is defined as having a left ventricle ejection fraction greater than 50% and is seen in approximately half of all HF patients. While metabolite signatures have been identified for HFrEF, characterization of biomarker and metabolite abnormalities for HFpEF remain incomplete. A more detailed understanding of HFpEF markers could aid in disease diagnosis and treatment decisions. This technology is a tool for diagnosing HFpEF and assessing the risk of major adverse cardiac events in patients with HFpEF. By measuring metabolites in blood samples, this method can be used to create a risk score that can inform treatment options, as well as monitor disease progression. To identify biomarkers for HFpEF, whole blood and plasma samples were taken from patients presenting for cardiac catheterization at Duke University Medical Center. Fatty acid, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolites from HFpEF, HFrEF and non-HF patients were analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. Significant differences in fatty acid oxidation and ketone related metabolites were identified in these samples that correlated with adverse outcomes and could aid in the diagnosis of HF.

Duke inventors have reported a gene therapy intended to treat the causes of retinal disease. This invention utilizes a novel Crb1 protein isoform, much smaller than the original protein, as part of a targeted Crb1 retinopathy gene therapy. This isoform has been found to be critical in the retina and in retinal development and is significant because it can be effectively packaged into a viral vector for gene delivery to patients. Advantages: This invention provides a strategy for stopping retinal disease progression rather than simply slowing it. The truncated Crb1 protein isoform can be packaged with an AAV vector.

    "ip_description": "An estimated 40 million surgeries are performed every year in the United States. Out of this population, an estimated 80% had post-operative pain with 75% reporting it as moderate to extreme. Local anesthetics are commonly used to reduce the risk of postoperative chronic pain, decrease opioid consumption, and offer a fast postoperative recovery. However, their duration of action is insufficient to manage pain relief for the duration of post-operative pain, establishing a need for a novel local anesthetic formulation that provides adequate and extended pain management for patients. Duke inventors from the Biomedical Engineering and Anesthesiology Departments have developed a nanoparticle based local anesthetic using machine learning. This is intended to be a simple to manufacture and extended duration injectable post-operative anesthetic. A computational decision system combining machine learning and molecular simulations was used to aid in the selection of the suitable combination of excipient molecules and local anesthetics. In one combination, the nanoparticles are formed by combining bupivacaine, an injectable local anesthetic, with Congo Red. The resulting nanoparticles are highly stable, have a radius of 60-70 nm, and can achieve over 60% drug loading. This has been demonstrated by characterizing the size of the resulting nanoparticles over weeks to months. In mouse models, the nanoparticle formulation was perineurally injected, and demonstrated significantly prolonged pain relief compared to drug alone with full sensory recovery in both groups. Furthermore, early motor, sensory, and histological mouse data suggest no major differences compared to drug alone once effects have subsided. This technology could be used for single-shot regional anesthesia, infiltration, or nerve blocks as an alternative to catheter-based pain management approaches. Advantages include: Simple and self-assembled nanoparticle formation without need for further purification, High and consistent drug loading around 60-80% for top candidates, Small particle size (~120-140 nm in diameter) enables delivery to target sites, Provide significantly prolonged analgesia versus free drug in animal models, Potential to reduce local anesthetic toxicity and dosage requirements, Potential to allow redosing or multi-site dosing compared to rupturable liposomal formulations, Highly stable for >48 hours and potentially weeks at room temperature.",

    "ip_description": "Venous thrombosis/thromboembolism (VT/E), the formation of a blood clot in vein, can be a life-threatening condition with 600,000 incidences in the US per year and affecting an estimated 10 million people globally. VT/E can take two forms: deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which impairs blood flow in deep veins of the body such as in the pelvis, lower legs or thighs, and pulmonary embolism, which occurs when a blood clot breaks off, travels to the lungs, and potentially blocks blood flow to the heart. The risk of VT/E rises dramatically with age; it is 2-7 times higher in patients over 55 compared to a younger cohort, and the majority of first-time incidences occur in patients over 45 years of age. While redness, swelling and pain are common symptoms, conclusive diagnosis of VT/E relies on blood tests using the D-dimer marker combined with imaging techniques. The nonspecific nature of the D-dimer marker means that it can increase due to various factors and display elevated levels in elderly patients even without VT/E. On the other hand, imaging techniques like Computer Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) pose risks like radiation exposure and contrast-related adverse effects. There is a need for novel biomarkers of VT/E enabling accurate and safe diagnosis in elderly patients.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of VT/E in elderly patients. This is intended to be developed into a diagnostic blood-based assay administered to an elderly patient deemed at high risk for VT/E or presenting symptoms. Specifically, the assay will detect deposition levels of complement C3 and C3a on red blood cells (RBCs) in response to TGF-beta1 as a VT/E biomarker. This has been demonstrated in RBCs from a healthy adult cohort between 55-68 years (n=15) and VT/E patients (n=10) showing elevated deposition of C3 and C3a proteins compared to a younger cohort (21-30 years old, n = 15). This biomarker can be used to predict the risk of thrombosis as well as the likelihood of recurring clot formation in VT/E patients.\n\nThis technology could also be applied to monitoring and diagnosing other thrombotic disorders or conditions related to complement C3 and C3a deposition on red blood cells.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Safer blood-based alternative to imaging techniques like CTPA, eliminating risks of radiation exposure.\n* Improved specificity for elderly patients, reducing likelihood of false positives.\n* Diagnostic and prognostic value, enabling early intervention and subsequent monitoring.",

This method empowers patients to manage their condition actively, improving treatment outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare providers. Self-management is essential in successful outcomes for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with childhood-onset chronic conditions (COCCs). Through active engagement with their treatments, AYAs develop the self-management skills necessary for transitioning from pediatric to adult care. Notably, such skills lead to adherence to lifestyle modifications and medication regimens vital for achieving positive adult outcomes. It's worth noting that despite its importance, only 32% of youth with special health care needs receive adequate transition preparation, highlighting the urgency for comprehensive interventions in this area. Evidence has demonstrated that peer-to-peer interventions have been successful in managing other conditions. Importantly, studies have shown that AYAs are interested in peer support interventions to address their challenges. Yet, peer coaching is underutilized to support COCCs. Therefore, to address this challenge, there is a need for scalable and proven interventions that implement coaching programs that assist AYAs with COCCs in developing and implementing self-management skills.\n\nDuke inventors introduced a peer coaching initiative to empower AYAS with COCCs to manage their health actively. Research has shown that peer support interventions are well-suited to address challenges AYAs face and, importantly, that AYAs are interested in this type of support. PICASO, or Peer i-Coaching for Activated Self-Management Optimization, is a mobile health intervention that pairs AYAs with peer coaches who have firsthand experience with COCCs.

However, these molecules often struggle to cross epithelial barriers or cause immune reactions, necessitating either injection or direct site administration to be effective. These obstacles to treatment can be mitigated by myristoylation, by which acyl groups are attached to a protein to help it bind albumin, which facilitates its transport through epithelial barriers and the bloodstream. However, myristoylation is either conducted chemically following protein synthesis or else requires rich, detergent-heavy media.

    "ip_description": "Older adults are at a higher risk of cognitive dysfunction after surgery, with postoperative delirium (POD) being the most common disorder. POD is characterized by inattentiveness and is seen in 70-80% of intensive care patients. Preoperative dementia is a significant predictor, with 10% of these patients developing POD. Patients experiencing cognitive decline stay 5-10 days longer in the hospital and may have poor long-term cognitive functioning post-surgery, often requiring placement in nursing homes or rehabilitation facilities. Predicting the likelihood of developing POD is challenging, as even seemingly \"healthy\" patients may display inattention after surgery. Although the exact cause of post-surgery cognitive dysfunction is still unknown, a significant predictor is the pre-existence of cognitive impairment. Screening tests for cognitive impairment have low accuracy for mild levels of impairment. These tests sample language skills, short-term recall, and time-place orientation. Patients can compensate for these functions, leading to test inaccuracy. There is a need for an objective method to assess and predict the risk of cognitive dysfunctions after surgery, especially with the increasing age of the surgical population.\n\nDuke inventors developed a non-invasive method to accurately predict rates of post-operative cognitive problems in patients over 60. This innovative approach offers health providers an objective and reliable screening tool that leverages direct, fixed brain metrics to identify patients at risk of developing POD. Specifically, the technology employs electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity while the patient performs a simple task involving opening and closing of the eyes. This task modulates brain activity in the 8 to 13Hz frequency band known as alpha oscillations. Inventors demonstrated that the strength of these alpha oscillations during the task predicts the risk of developing POD. The possibility of compensation is eliminated because this activity signature of the brain is an automatic response. This was demonstrated in a cohort of 71 patients over the age of 60, apparently cognitively normal. This screening test enabled prediction of patient risk of developing POD, representing an exciting opportunity to enhance post-operative patient care and improve overall outcomes.\n\nThis technology could also be adapted to detect the risk or likelihood of developing other cognitive disorders associated with attention-related functions.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   The test provides more accurate screening for post-operative cognitive problems by utilizing an automatic response that cannot be compensated against.\n*   EEG is non-invasive and offers insight into the internal state of the brain, leading to more accurate screening.\n*   The test can identify the likelihood of experiencing post-operative cognitive dysfunction and the extent to which individuals may experience such deficits.",

In addition to contributing to the opioid epidemic and causing infection outbreaks, drug diversion costs a yearly $70 billion within the healthcare industry alone. Methods to detect drug diversion, such as record audits, are labor intensive and performed infrequently. More recent innovations to address this problem have included AI-based systems to identify discrepancies in documentation and resolve these discrepancies. They also aim to identify individuals whose behavior (as implied by their documentation) may deviate from what is expected. Anesthesia providers (anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists), though, provide care involving a completely different workflow.

Therefore, there is a need for novel drug targets related to the BCAA pathway, as well as novel methods for detecting metabolic syndromes using this pathway.\n\nDuke inventors have (1) invented a novel diagnostic for NAFLD that detects increased levels of BCAA metabolites in blood, (2) identified a set of drug targets that, when inhibited or activated, can modulate BCAA metabolism, and (3) developed a novel peptide therapy that modulates glucose metabolism. These inventions are intended to be used by clinicians seeking to diagnose or treat relevant metabolic syndromes. Specifically, the NAFLD/NASH diagnostic technology measures the ratio of certain BCAAs that correlate with disease severity in a subset of patients. The novel drug targets identified by the inventors are agonists of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex and its interactors. Modulation of this key regulatory complex can relieve the BCAA buildup associated with metabolic disease. Additionally, the inventors identified that injection of a truncated version of the prohormone VGF modulates glucose levels through a BCAA-independent mechanism. Modulation of BCAA metabolism utilizing the above methods improves glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and hepatic steatosis on a much faster timescale than traditional weight loss methods in animal models of metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes.\n\nIn addition to type II diabetes, obesity, and NAFLD/NASH, this technology could also be used in some cancers, and for pain and neurodegenerative conditions.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Injection of the prohormone VGF has low toxicity profiles, providing acute and chronic improvement of glycemic control while preserving existing islet cell mass and function\n* Diagnostic measurement of BCAA metabolites in the blood provides a non-invasive alternative to liver biopsy for diagnosing NAFLD and potentially preventing progression into NASH\n* Modulation of the BCAA pathway via novel targets had additional beneficial effects in pre-clinical studies, including decreased lipogenesis and increased fatty acid oxidation",

EUV lithography uses wavelengths of light that are as small as 13 nm to produce incredibly high-resolution features. However, a key challenge in achieving high quality lithographic patterning is accurately modeling the electromagnetic scattering of EUV light as it passes through the lithography mask.

    "ip_description": "The gene editing sector has experienced a transformative surge in technological advancements with the emergence of CRISPR-Cas systems. These systems offer unprecedented capability to modify and modulate genetic sequences, proving instrumental from fundamental science to medical applications. Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems, utilizing single-effector proteins such as Cas9 and Cas12a, have simplified genome editing by using RNA-guided nucleases that eliminate the need for complex protein engineering. However, despite the scientific community\u2019s widespread adoption of CRISPR-Cas9 for its versatility, this and other Class 2 systems have limitations, including restrictive protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM) requirements and off-target activities. These limitations lead to undesirable outcomes such as reduced targeting flexibility and increased risk of unintended genetic alternations. In contrast, Class 1 CRISPR-Case systems, with their multi-subunit effector composition, form a complex known as Cascade. Despite representing approximately 90% of CRISPR-Cas systems, their complexity has hindered widespread adoption by scientists. However, this complexity allows for a more refined interaction with genetic material. This enables potentially broader gene manipulation capabilities and offers promising solutions to address the Class 2 limitations. There is a need for a more flexible and precise Class 1 CRISPR gene modulation system that offers a broader targeting PAM range, higher specificity in target recognition, and reduced off-target interactions.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a gene modulation system for the precise control of targeted gene expression in human cells.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "In the US alone, close to 1.9 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed each year and 44.5% of these patients will experience chronic pain. This type of chronic pain, called neuropathic pain, is due to dysregulation of GABA neurotransmitter signaling. Neuropathic pain is common after cancer treatments like radiation and chemotherapy and can also be caused by bone malignancy. Neuropathic pain can be debilitating for patients and frequently affects their quality of life. Current pain management options can include non-opioid drugs which function by reducing inflammation, but these often have limited effects and extended use can lead to kidney and cardiovascular damage. Other pain management options can include opioid drugs which work by activating opioid receptors in the body to block pain signals. Extended use of opioids can lead patients to develop high tolerances and even addiction. Thus, there is a great need for pain management alternatives that directly restore neurotransmitter signaling rather than blocking pain signals to more effectively treat pain and reduce side effects.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a new method for treating neuropathic pain in patients with cancer. Specifically, the novel compound they have developed is a gene expression enhancer for a potassium chloride cotransporter called KCC2. This cotransporter controls the levels of chloride ions in cells which is required for functional activity of the neurotransmitter GABA. In neuropathic pain, the expression of KCC2 is depleted in neurons. This expression deficit creates an ion imbalance and prevents successful GABA-ergic inhibitory neurotransmission, thus leading to neuropathic pain. Inventors have demonstrated that this novel treatment reduces neuropathic pain and bone cancer pain in mouse models. This new method directly targets the root cause of neuropathic pain compared to current standard of care treatments.\n\nAs this technology enhances gene expression of a cotransporter that can be disrupted in multiple disease backgrounds, this new method could potentially have therapeutic use in the treatment of epilepsy, spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries, neurodegeneration, and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Less risk of side effects and addiction compared to current standard of care\n* Mouse models demonstrate reduced neuropathic pain following treatment\n* Mouse models showed no unwanted side effects in behavior, stamina, or coordination\n* Could be a treatment strategy for other neurological diseases",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Color-flow ultrasound imaging is a technique that allows for visualization of blood flow within tissues and is frequently used to diagnose cardiovascular abnormalities, guide needle biopsies, examine tumor vascularity, and measure blood flow velocity. In the case of carotid arterial disease, a precursor to stroke affecting about 5% of the US population, ultrasound assessment and peak blood flow velocity measurements derived therein are often the only criteria used to determine whether intervention is necessary. Despite its use in several vital medical procedures, color-flow ultrasound imaging remains notoriously poorly resolved, due to the inability of these systems to accurately filter out \u2018clutter\u2019, or background sound waves from the environment. Existing ultrasound systems rely on static filters that attempt to filter out clutter based on standard thresholds of motion and magnitude of background sound waves. However, these simple thresholds have proven insufficient to effectively discriminate clutter, especially when background waves have similar magnitude and motion to ultrasound waves of interest. Furthermore, when these thresholds are set too low or too high, vital diagnostic measurements such as blood flow velocity become skewed. As a result, poor ultrasound quality and resolution can drastically affect diagnosis of potentially fatal heart conditions and resulting medical interventions chosen for patients. Given this, there is a need for a filtering technology that assesses clutter on an ongoing basis rather than as a static feature and can effectively identify and filter out clutter.\n\nDuke inventors have developed an improved ultrasound imaging method that more accurately visualizes cardiovascular abnormalities and improves the accuracy of blood flow velocity measurements. This is intended to be used as a new data analysis platform for ultrasound color flow imaging data, which has become the standard mode of imaging in almost all diagnostic ultrasound systems. Specifically, ensemble echo data is passed through a bank of different clutter filters and a unique feature of waves called spatial coherence is measured from the output of each filter. Spatial coherence has been demonstrated to be a more reliable metric than motion or magnitude for discriminating between ultrasound waves and clutter. The filter which yields the maximum spatial coherence is selected for subsequent use. With this methodology, multiple features of the clutter waves are used to dynamically select for the optimum filter to discriminate against them, rather than relying on a standard threshold. This introduces an added dimension to better discriminate between flow and clutter signals and improve filtering, particularly under conditions where motion and magnitude-based methods fail. Compared to existing filtering technologies, coherence-adaptive clutter filtering more effectively suppresses bias from clutter while more accurately assessing flow rates as compared to ground truth. Because of this added resolution, coherence-adaptive filtering also resolved important biological structures such as small blood vessels not otherwise seen with standard imaging technologies. This has been demonstrated in simulation experiments using existing ultrasound data, and in _in vivo_ liver and fetal imaging in patients.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Dynamic system that adjusts to different background conditions to effectively filter out clutter\n*   Increased resolution during imaging allows visualization of otherwise unseen biological features\n*   Easily integrated into existing ultrasound imaging platforms\n*   Can be used live, or on previously acquired ultrasound data",

In a subset of cases (~5% or 200,000 patients), adhesions can lead to a range of serious health issues, including small bowel obstruction, infections, chronic pain, and inflammation, some of which require additional surgery. Moreover, the financial burden associated with managing and treating these complications is substantial, with estimates suggesting hospital and surgeon expenditures exceeds $1 billion annually in the United States. The current standard of care utilizes meshes coated with a hydrophilic biodegradable film designed to support damaged tissue, with the coating acting to inhibit protein binding and thus reduce tissue adhesions. However, these meshes often fall short in durability leading to micro-fractures and delamination, and they degrade rapidly. There is a need for improved meshes with robust mechanical properties coated in enhanced materials to prevent or reduce the formation of adhesions.\n\nDuke inventors have developed an improved biodegradable mesh for use in abdominal surgeries known to cause adhesions. This invention features an elastomer mesh base offering superior durability, with a functionalized coating shown to reduce adhesion formation. This is intended for surgeons to implant in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Specifically, the inventors developed a novel propargyl derivatized thiol-yne elastomer and functionalized it with zwitterions to suppress protein adsorption and therefore adhesion formation. This has been demonstrated in both murine and rabbit models. In rabbit hernia models, implantation demonstrated a reduction in both extent and severity of adhesions by 94% and 90%, respectively.\n\nThis technology could be used in other surgical indications requiring mesh, such as pelvic organ prolapse repair, reconstructive surgery, and wound management. Additionally, this technology could be used for implantable bioelectronic devices. This has been demonstrated in a craniotomy model in rats.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Zwitterion coated mesh reduced the extent and severity of adhesions by 94% and 90% in rabbit hernia models, respectively\n* Protein adsorption is substantially reduced (73% reduction in binding fibrinogen)\n* Mechanical tests demonstrate the coating remains intact, outperforming existing coated meshes that fracture.",

The cervical spine is vulnerable to severe injury in settings ranging from automotive crashes to athletic accidents. While cadaveric studies conducted here at Duke University's Injury and Orthopaedic Biomechanics Laboratory have provided valuable insights into cervical spine injury, the limitations of cadaveric experimentation have precluded a comprehensive study of the numerous variables influencing injury risk. Use of computational models to study injury has eliminated the interspecimen variability, technical challenges, and expense inherent to cadaveric experimentation. The reliability of model predictions critically hinges on an appropriate mechanical representation of the component tissues and validation of model performance against experimental data.\n\nThe Duke head and neck computational model is a hybrid lumped parameter ligamentous cervical spine with eight joints, each consisting of three discrete element pairs, connecting a finite element viscoelastic head with eight rigid body vertebrae (Hypermesh from Altair Engineering Inc., LS-INGRID, LS-DYNA, LS-PREPOST from LSTC, Livermore, CA). Each discrete element pair is comprised of a nonlinear spring and linear damper in parallel. While geometrically accurate in three dimensions, neck behavior is only modeled in the sagittal plane with two translational elements (in compression-tension and anteroposterior shear) and one rotational element (in flexion-extension) that couple the superior vertebra to the next inferior vertebra. The joint kinetics is defined about the center of rotation, a node connected to the superior body.\n\nNeck musculature is modeled using two nonlinear springs in parallel, one for the passive and the other for the active muscle properties. The modeled muscles are based on a comprehensive set of anthropometric parameters. Using optimization to minimize muscle fatigue or maximize force in these muscles produced initial conditions representing both a relaxed and tensed muscle activation scheme respectively in which the head and neck were stable under the action of gravity. Further developments to the Duke head and neck computational model will include enhancing the muscles to follow neck curvature during bending and creating a series of pediatric models of different representative age groups.\n\n(Originally written and published by the Duke Injury Biomechanics Laboratory)",

    "ip_description": "The soil properties have a critical impact on the accuracy of the land surface and hydrologic models, which are essential for applications in monitoring the climate and optimizing agriculture. The soil monitoring market in the United States was $84.3 million in 2021 with a CAGR of 11.4%. However, there is a lack of spatially complete and high-quality data sets that describe the soil properties over continental extents, and a lack of robust and realistic measures of uncertainty within these data. There is a need for fine-scale probabilistic soil property databases to inform parameter estimation frameworks for hydrologic and land surface models. Duke inventors have developed a soil classification and property database. This is intended to be used for weather forecasting and precision agriculture. Specifically, the database could be used to improve the environmental modeling of biogeochemical, water, and energy cycles, thus enhancing the data availability for precision agriculture and assisting hydrologic monitoring and forecasting to ensure food and water security. This has been demonstrated by using peta-scale high performance computing in digital soil mapping to generate POLARIS soil series probabilities over the contiguous United States at a 30-meter spatial resolution. The POLARIS soil series database is based on a century of soil survey data and readily available high-resolution environmental covariates, while it is a spatial disaggregation, harmonization, and gap filling of the currently available database. Inventors then generated the POLARIS soil properties database that includes 13 soil property variables at 6 different depth layers by combining a soil characterization database and the POLARIS soil series database. By providing locally relevant prior distributions for all layers and variables per 30-meter grid cell, more realistic constraints can be placed on the optimization routines of land surface and hydrologic models. Further improvements of POLARIS soil properties should focus on improving the accuracy of POLARIS soil series and accounting for both the spatial covariance and inter-property covariance. Advantages include a spatially continuous, internally consistent, and quantitative prediction of soil classification and property database with a high degree of granularity (30-meter) covering the entire contiguous United States, incorporating 13 soil property variables at 6 different depth layers, improved prior distributions of soil properties for optimizing hydrologic and land surface models, and an innovative use of high performance computing in digital soil mapping.",

    "ip_description": "Ionizing radiation poses a significant risk as an environmental hazard and is linked to the development of multiple cancers in adults and children. Healthcare professionals, nuclear power plant employees, and research scientists are among those frequently exposed to ionizing radiation in the workplace. Beyond routine occupational exposure, accidents in these settings can expose individuals to higher-than-intended levels of ionizing radiation. Further, a recent US government study modeled the effect of a nuclear detonation in a major metropolitan region and has estimated that >300,000 individuals would require medical attention. In these scenarios, triaging thousands of individuals with radiation exposure is difficult as current standards, lymphocyte depletion kinetic assays and cytogenic analysis, have lengthy time-to-results compromising prompt care. Lymphocyte depletion kinetic assays track the rate of change in lymphocyte levels, a measure that directly correlates with absorbed radiation dose. This analysis is time intensive as it requires daily blood draws from patients. Separately, cytogenetic analysis identifies breaks in DNA following radiation exposure to determine absorbed radiation dose. This complicated analysis is time and labor intensive as it requires days to run and skilled laboratory personnel to execute testing and assess samples. Delaying treatment following radiation exposure can make patient outcomes significantly worse. There is a need for improved high-throughput diagnostic screening tests to accurately and rapidly identify individuals with significant exposure to ionizing radiation.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a screening test for radiation exposure. This is intended to be used by clinicians to assess radiation exposure and interrogate exposure level. Specifically, Duke inventors have discovered a set of genes that when analyzed together predict an absorbed radiation dose. Gene expression analysis is performed by collecting whole blood, extracting RNA, and analyzing the sample for specific gene expression patterns. This test is adaptable for high-throughput screening, enabling analysis of >600 samples in less than 24 hours. Further, the time to results for this test is < 8 hours. This has been demonstrated in nonhuman primate (NHP) irradiation experiments, where the test achieved 98.5% sensitivity and 90% specificity in detecting lower-dose irradiation (2.0 Gy), and 92% sensitivity and 84% specificity for higher-dose irradiation (6.0 Gy). These findings are clinically meaningful because patients with absorbed radiation levels between 2.0 and 6.0 Gy are the most likely to benefit from prompt medical intervention, whereas those with absorbed radiation levels above 6.0 Gy have a poor clinical prognosis.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Amenable to high-throughput analysis with time to results in less than 8 hours (~40 hours sooner than best-case scenario gold-standard)\n- Pilot testing across labs demonstrated a coefficient of variation (CV) of 11%\n- Low incidence of false positives and false negatives\n- Eliminates the need for special handling of blood samples",

    "ip_description": "Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common male cancer globally and represents 15% of all cancers diagnosed in males. An estimated 34,700 deaths were predicted to occur from PC in the U.S. in 2023. Most deaths occur when the PC evolves into metastatic castration-resistant PC (CRPC) which does not respond well to standard-of-care treatments, such as androgen therapy, due to a lack of receptor expression that the therapies target. In addition, neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) is a hallmark of CRPC and occurs after therapies such as radiation, correlating with worse prognosis. Yet, there is a lack of understanding of the molecular mechanism leading to NED as it relates to CRPC, resulting in a limited amount of therapy options for patients with this disease. Current therapies include chemo/radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and PARP inhibition. The limited number of treatments is one reason for the extremely low overall survival time for metastatic CRPC patients, being as low as 13.5 months. Thus, there is a need for more molecular targets of NED that could expand therapy options for metastatic CRPC patients.\n\nDuke inventors have identified several agonists and antagonists that could potentially regulate NED. These molecules could be used to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who present NED. Specifically, agonists and antagonists for the olfactory receptor OR51E2 were identified and shown to potentially mediate or block the transition of CRPC to NED phenotype, motivating therapeutic development. This has been demonstrated in prostate cancer cell lines after _in silico_ screening and _in vitro_ validation identified several ligands of OR51E2 that either inhibited or activated the receptor and downstream signaling. The inventors also tested the top candidates on LNCaP human prostate cancer cells for their effect on the expression of NED-indicative genes and metabolic profile. It will be important for the inventors to further demonstrate faithful NED transitioning of PC cells and therapeutic efficacy of blocking NED.\n\nThis technology could also be used for diagnosing PC. By contacting OR51E2 ligands with a biopsy specimen, the levels of metabolites associated with activated OR51E2 could be compared to a control sample, where increased metabolism associated with OR51E2 indicates PC.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   New target for treating metastatic CRPC\n*   Large number of options for fine-tuning the binding of ligand to OR51E2\n*   Targets a relatively upstream actor in CRPC development (NED)",

Current kidney models fail to recapitulate the real kidney due to artificial mechanical properties or because they are optically opaque which restricts the training potential of the model. This limits their effectiveness in training and providing a foundational skill set for new urologists.

There is a need for improved signal processing algorithms that can more cleanly detect Beta oscillations and more accurately identify correlated bursts so that existing therapeutic methods can be made more effective.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a signal processing algorithm that can more accurately detect Beta oscillation bursts that correspond with Parkinson\u2019s disease symptoms.

Specifically, the inventors repurposed several variants of Type I CRISPR-Cas systems from _Escherichia coli_ and _Listeria monocytogenes_ to express the multi-component RNA-guided Cascade complex in human cells in order to target and regulate specific loci in the human genome. Through a series of molecular modifications, the inventors achieved Cascade expression, complex formation, and nuclear localization in human cells. The inventors were also able to program CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to make Cascade target specific loci. Furthermore, the inventors tethered activation and repression domains to Cascade to activate and repress specific endogenous genes in human cells via transient and stable expression of the Cascade fusion. Gene activation was as high as 3,000-fold, and gene repression was observed on both transcript and protein levels. Additionally, preliminary data demonstrated use of multiple crRNAs to activate multiple endogenous genes simultaneously. Additional data suggested that their Type I system may outperform Type II in efficacy and specificity. The Type I CRISPR-Cas system is also anticipated to enable programmable genome editing by degrading the DNA target and generating double-stranded breaks, single-stranded nicks, or long-range chromosomal deletions.

Whether for larger spaces, such as buildings, or smaller spaces, such as airplanes, air ventilation provides clean, potentially filtered air and can assist with air conditioning or heating. These conditions are even more critical in medical or industrial settings that have strict air quality standards and need to mitigate airborne contaminants. The potential danger of airborne contaminants became widely known during the COVID-19 pandemic, also highlighting the lack of widely available filtration systems for public places. Current ventilation systems are two way and require an inlet, pulling in air from the local environment, and an outlet, ejecting air that has been conditioned or filtered. These two port systems require machinery that is large enough to accommodate these ports while regulating the internal air pressure inside the ventilation unit. Thus, there is a need for more compact ventilation units that can provide readily accessible refined air in tight spaces.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a ventilation system that intakes and outputs air through a single port, requiring less space and complexity than traditional ventilation devices. This is intended to be used when designing compact, personal spaces where fresh air is minimal, such as on airplanes or operating rooms. Specifically, the system utilizes a \u201cbreathing\u201d style circulation, where air is pulled into and out of the same port, reducing the space and energy required to operate the ventilator. The internal enclosure can modify the air purity or composition and can be used to regulate temperature. The timing of air inhalation and expulsion can be altered to change the rate that air is introduced and modified in the local environment, while the geometry can be modified to maximize air circulation and ensure filtration of all air in the space. This has been demonstrated conceptually to provide continuous air filtration and mixing that would be ideal for air decontamination where pollutants are localized to a small vicinity.\n\nThis technology could also be used as an aerosolizer that could eject particulates in a shape-controlled pulse of air out of the system.

    "ip_description": "Duke inventors have developed a mutant plant protein that makes plants both stress-resistant and high-yielding. The mutant protein is intended to be stably expressed in transgenic crops. Specifically, the inventors engineered a mutated version of Nonexpressor of Pathogenesis-Related genes 1 (NPR1), a protein that mediates immune responses in a wide range of plant species. This gene can currently be overexpressed in a variety of plant species to enhance their resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, though this inhibits plant growth. By introducing 3 mutations in NPR1, the inventors created a mutant called SBD-ANK locked (SAL), which is able to protect crops from biotic and abiotic stresses without inhibiting growth. This has been demonstrated _in vivo_ in transgenic plants. When exposed to growth-inhibiting chemicals and pathogenic microorganisms, plants expressing SAL accumulated more biomass and experienced less cell death compared to plants expressing wildtype NPR1. This technology could also be used to produce a kit that transiently expresses SAL in plants, as well as DNA vectors containing SAL. Beyond agriculture, this technology could be used to further research immune response pathways in plants. Advantages include protecting plants against both biotic stresses from pathogens and abiotic stresses from the environment without inhibiting plant growth, maintaining high crop yields while enhancing stress responses, reducing the need for pesticides and fertilizers by utilizing native immune systems in crops, genetic editing bypassing the need for conventional backcrossing and accelerating the delivery of improved plant varieties, and benefiting a wide variety of crops, including high-acreage agronomic crops (rice, wheat, soybean, peanut, potato) and horticultural crops (grape, carrot, tomato, apple, citrus, tobacco, strawberry).",

    "ip_description": "In the US, it is estimated that 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer, of which 78% are estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cases. These ER+ breast cancers are known for their risk of recurrence, which remains consistent over time, even decades after the initial treatment. Approximately 30% of breast cancer survivors, considered 'free of disease,' may face locoregional or metastatic recurrence. This is often due to dormant cancer cells that evade the immune system's surveillance, remaining quiescent until conditions trigger their regrowth, leading to a delayed relapse specifically in ER+ breast cancer cases. These largely non-proliferative dormant cancer cells can manipulate their microenvironment to support survival, evading current treatments designed for active cancer cells. Hence, the existing therapies, such as hormone therapy or immunotherapies, fall short in addressing the threat posed by these dormant tumor cells within the crucial period between remission and relapse. This gap increases the likelihood of the tumor cells developing resistance mechanisms that make subsequent treatment challenging. There is a need for a therapeutic strategy that can specifically target dormant breast cancer cells to prevent future recurrence and improve long-term patient outcomes.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a biological molecule targeted for the treatment of delayed-relapse cancer. This is intended to inhibit the growth of recurrent breast cancer in patients prone to relapse. Specifically, the inventors discovered that the Dickkopf WNT Signaling Pathway Inhibitor 3 (DKK3) molecule plays a critical role in controlling immune evasion as it governs the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs). These Tregs, in turn, suppress the action of CD8+ T cells that are essential for the immune system\u2019s ability to destroy tumor cells. Therefore, inhibiting DKK3 could potentially be an effective method for suppressing the growth of dormant cancer and T regulatory cells. This has been demonstrated in mouse models, where the inhibition of DKK3 led to greater tumor rejection compared to controls.\n\nThis technology could also be utilized in other dormant cancer cell types, such as pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, brain cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, and lung cancer. Besides, the technology also holds potential for use in combination with other immunotherapeutic treatments.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Novel targeting of Treg cells via the discovered DKK3 molecule pathway to prevent cancer relapse\n*   Increased efficacy in reactivating the immune response against dormant cancer cells, particularly in breast cancer\n*   Enhances immunotherapy efficacy and complements other treatments to improve outcomes",

These devices can treat heart failure, epilepsy, and chronic pain among other ailments. Depending on the disease, the implanted device will stimulate one or more target nerves throughout the body. However, this approach is limited in efficacy because the stimulation signals can either fail to stimulate sufficiently the target nerve or can cause off-target stimulatory effects on nerves within the targeted area. Mitigating these factors is made difficult by the substantial computing power necessary to calculate the ideal stimulation signal for a specific set of nerves given a condition to treat.

    "ip_description": "Gene expression is highly regulated through the addition of chemical modifications to RNA molecules. One such modification is methylation of adenosine residues to form m6A, a modified nucleotide which is found in thousands of cellular RNAs and which plays critical roles in cellular function. m6A is deposited in RNAs by methyltransferase enzymes, and recent studies have revealed that dysregulation of m6A and m6A methyltransferase proteins contributes to a variety of human diseases, including cardiovascular disease, infection, and several cancers. Consistent with this, m6A methyltransferase proteins have emerged as promising therapeutic targets for cancer. However, identifying drugs or small molecules that interact with these enzymes is challenging since there are no methods available for directly assessing the effects of candidate drugs on m6A methyltransferase activity at high throughput. Thus, there is a need for an easy to use, high-throughput assay for measuring RNA methylation in cells.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a novel sensor system that is intended to be used to screen for m6A methylation of mRNAs in living cells. This system contains two components: 1) a modified deaminase enzyme that binds to m6A sites in and catalyzes C-to-U mutations at nearby cytidine residues, and 2) a reporter mRNA. The reporter mRNA contains the coding sequence for a fluorescent protein followed by a short linker region and then the coding sequence for a destabilizing domain. The linker region contains sequences that are susceptible to m6A modification. When this linker region is methylated, the deaminase enzyme binds to m6A and converts nearby cytidines to uridines, which results in in-frame stop codons being introduced into the reporter mRNA. This prevents translation of the destabilizing domain and results in stable fluorescent protein production. In the absence of methylation, the reporter mRNA produces a destabilized fluorescent protein and cells do not fluoresce. Thus, this system provides a simple readout for the presence of m6A (methylation = cellular fluorescence; no methylation = no fluorescence). This technology has been demonstrated to effectively sense m6A cultured cells and to respond to both pharmacological inhibition and genetic disruption of the m6A methyltransferase enzyme.\n\nThis technology could also be used to screen for and identify endogenous cellular proteins involved in RNA methylation and demethylation as well as in high-throughput screens for small molecules or other inhibitors of m6A methyltransferase or demethylase enzymes for drug development.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Can be used in a variety of tissues, cells, and animal models to detect the presence of mRNA methylation\n* Compatible with current fluorescence-based sorting and screening equipment\n* Provides a readout for m6A in living cells",

These systems have proved useful for studying cellular behavior like neuronal firing and the molecular arrangement of lipid membranes. However, it remains difficult to image large-field specimens of large thickness while retaining resolution. A large amount of information can be extracted through polarization-sensitive microscopes that capture anisotropic properties of transparent biological samples like material birefringence and orientation, and these information are largely untapped with current optical phase imaging systems. Computationally integrating polarization information can be used to reconstruct high-resolution 3D images of thick tissues useful for imaging clinical samples and small model organisms. To date, there are relatively few microscopic techniques that can capture both quantitative phase and anisotropy across large 3D volumes, with none providing tomographic reconstructions.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a high-resolution microscopy method using Fourier Ptychography.

This therapy uses T-cells that are genetically engineered ex vivo to activate the immune system, clear tumor cells, and improve patient outcomes. These engineered T-cells express a receptor to selectively recognize tumor surface antigens on one end and initiate a signaling cascade via an intracellular domain on the other end. However, the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy against solid tumors remains limited. Solid organ tumors modify their surrounding environment to inactivate T cells. Further, the CAR-T cell therapy must target a protein specific to the tumor to prevent off target killing. Yet, 93% of new cancer cases in the US are solid organ tumors. One such example is squamous cell carcinoma which includes multiple tumor subtypes including in the head and neck, lung, esophagus, bladder, cervix, and skin. Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common type of skin cancer in the US with more than 1 million cases diagnosed per year and current treatments primarily rely on performing micrographic surgery.

    "ip_description": "After experiencing a heart attack, the adult human heart has no capacity to regenerate lost or damaged cardiac myocytes. This results in severely reduced heart function and eventually heart failure. There are more than 3 million people in the U.S. who suffer from heart failure, with more than 600,000 heart attacks happening each year. The prevention of heart failure is anticipated to represent a $1 billion market. A major potential strategy to prevent heart failure is through the regeneration of cardiac myocytes by cellular reprogramming. Recent advances have established that cardiac fibroblasts can be directly reprogrammed into cardiac myocytes via a distinct combination of microRNAs (miRNAs) called miR combo. While miR combo improves cardiac function, the effects are too low for clinical applications. Efficacy would be improved by addressing stoichiometry and the specificity of delivery.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a drug delivery system. This is intended to be used for efficient cardiac tissue regeneration through targeted reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts into cardiac myocytes in vivo. Specifically, the inventors developed an optimized delivery system that is comprised of two parts. One part comprises an expression system which expresses each miRNA of miR combo at the optimal ratio for effective fibroblast reprogramming. The second part of the delivery system is focused on the specific targeting of fibroblasts. The inventors screened various AAV (adeno-associated virus) variants and discovered that AAV2/1 was preferentially targeting cardiac fibroblasts. By optimizing stoichiometry and identifying a fibroblast-targeting virus, the inventors were able to improve miR combo efficacy ~30-fold. Thus, this system is of great clinical benefit to patients who have experienced cardiac infarction or other cardiac conditions.\n\nAdvantages:\n* A more effective method to reprogram cardiac fibroblasts into cardiac myocytes, with ~15% converting efficiency\n* Strong evidence shows that optimizing stoichiometry is necessary for efficient miRNA-based cellular reprogramming, with up to 4-fold increase in the expression level of cardiomyocyte markers\n* Identified AAV1 as the targeted delivery vector, which exhibited more than 30-fold higher selectivity towards cardiac fibroblasts",

    "ip_description": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disease that can impact the hands, knees, neck, lower back, and hips, leading to pain and restrictive mobility from the breakdown of connective tissue in these joints. OA is the most common form of arthritis and knee OA in particular is estimated to impact 654.1 million people over 40 years of age, globally. In the US alone, knee OA contributes to over $27 billion in healthcare costs. With an aging population, these burdens are only projected to increase. There is currently no cure available for OA. As such, treatment usually focuses on pain reduction and surgical procedures. Early detection and intervention are imperative for minimizing disease progression. However, diagnostic tools for early detection, especially in a non-invasive manner, are not available. There is a need for non-invasive diagnostic tools that can definitively identify OA and facilitate early detection and disease management.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a set of diagnostic biomarkers for OA. This is intended to be screened for in a minimally invasive manner from patient blood plasma. Specifically, the inventors have identified blood plasma extracellular vesicle (EV) surface markers specific to knee OA severity and progression. These EV surface markers are highly correlated with EVs in the joint synovial fluid that have been implicated in a pathogenic role in OA progression. This has been demonstrated in matched synovial fluid and blood plasma samples from two patient cohorts (total n = 30) with use of untargeted proteomic analyses to identify the biomarkers. These biomarkers are highly predictive of knee OA progression with AUC values of up to 0.95 (an AUC of 1 being the maximum and indicating perfect prediction).\n\nThis technology could also be expanded to other forms of arthritis.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Minimally invasive diagnostic tool for osteoarthritis from patient blood plasma\n* High predictive accuracy for osteoarthritis severity and progression\n* Proactive disease management to decelerate joint degeneration and improve patient outcomes",

    "ip_description": "Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American women and the fourth most common cause of all cancer-related deaths in the U.S. While early screening for cancer using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has increased by over 50% in the last decade, breast cancer diagnosis is often complicated by the number of subtypes present. Breast cancer is generally classified into luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-enriched, and basal-like. These molecular subtypes are highly significant in cancer therapy because encoded within them are characterized progressions and response rates to particular treatments. For example, HER2-enriched breast cancer is highly proliferative and responds best to chemotherapy and HER2-targeting therapies, while luminal A patients benefit from endocrine therapy more than chemotherapy, and vice versa with luminal B. The risk of recurrence also correlates with subtype, where HER2-positive and basal are around five times more likely to recur either locally or distally than either luminal subtype. However, methods to classify subtypes such as standard immunohistochemical analyses do not robustly predict true molecular subtype and require invasive surgery to extract tumor tissue for analysis. Thus, it is necessary to develop methods that can more accurately detect molecular subtype and ease the burden on both breast cancer patients and hospitals.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a software that can analyze MR images of breast tumors and determine key features of prognosis. This is intended to be used by technicians, radiologists, and oncologists in pre-operative settings after non-invasive MRI-based screening has taken place. Specifically, technicians upload the previously-acquired MR images, and an oncologist/radiologist indicates the tumor location. Subsequently, the software segments the tumor into lesion and surrounding parenchyme and extracts key features such as the ratio of tumor enhancement to the surrounding tissue at two frames of the sequence of contrast images (F1 score). The peak location is also another metric measured which refers to the sequence number at which peak tumor enhancement occurs. Both the F1 score and peak location were shown to predict the molecular subtype and consequent recurrence risk. Since this is an algorithmic prediction based on imaging from routine screening, this technology could preclude the need for invasive tumor biopsies and expensive biomarker processing. This technology has been demonstrated using labelled patient data to train a statistical model on these image features and their corresponding prediction of molecular subtype. The inventors identified key features that can distinguish luminal A and luminal B breast cancer subtypes and this technology likely has the potential to be expanded to HER2-enriched and basal subtypes with additional datasets.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Bypasses the need for invasive biopsies required for immunohistochemical analysis\n*   Accurately predicts molecular subtype of luminal A/B breast cancer\n*   Significantly faster diagnosis than through conventional pathologist assessment (hours versus weeks, respectively)",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "About 325,000 people in the United States die from sudden cardiac death (SCD) caused by ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) each year. When a patient experiences VT, the lower chamber of their heart beats faster than normal causing chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. This may lead to ventricular fibrillation, a condition in which the heart does not contract properly, so blood is not pumped effectively to the brain and body. Though VT often leads to SCD, there are no reliable and effective methods to identify individuals at risk for developing these arrhythmias. Current methods and risk stratification strategies are unclear, and most victims are not identified as high risk before experiencing SCD. There is a need for a novel risk assessment that more accurately and reliably identifies individuals at high risk for SCD.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a novel risk assessment method to assess patients\u2019 susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias before cardiac disease can be detected using current clinical diagnostic tools. Specifically, the invention is a novel method to evaluate the stability-of-propagation reserve (SoPR) using a refraction-diffusion model, which measures the susceptibility to propagation instabilities and arrhythmias. This model utilizes two metrics: the reserve of refractoriness (RoR), the difference between the minimum level of medium refractoriness and the critical threshold for the stable solitary pulse, and the reserve of memory (RoM), the short-term cardiac memory. These metrics are combined to determine the SoPR and predict the likelihood of conduction block, more accurately capturing patients at risk. The feasibility of data collection in patients has been demonstrated for surface ECG measurements and for electrophysiological studies in the clinic.\n\nApplications:\n- Large-scale population screenings in medical settings of all sizes\n- Monitoring at-risk patient populations including those with Holter devices and implanted cardioverter defibrillators\n- Assessing the impact of various treatments including ICD therapy, surgical procedures, and drug therapy on arrhythmia susceptibility\n\nAdvantages:\n- Captures a wider range of proarrhythmic states to more accurately identify patients at risk\n- No specialized equipment required as it uses current commercial ECG exercise testing equipment\n- Noninvasive medical assessment compared to the current standard catheterization procedure\n- Patient remains comfortable and unstressed during the assessment",

    "ip_description": "Currently, red blood cell (RBC) testing focuses on factors such as hemoglobin content, RBC count, blood typing, and antibody content. These tests, though comprehensive, do not measure the health and quality of RBCs. This is especially relevant in the context of blood transfusions. RBCs taken from patients are stored in blood bags, where they can develop lesions after extended periods of storage. Current tests are unable to determine time of storage, meaning that patients could receive subpar transfusions that could have many lesioned or non-viable RBCs. This affects the efficacy of the transfusion, and the transfusion of lesioned cells could also contribute to patient complications. Despite the fact that there are 16 million blood transfusions that occur annually in the USA, there are no tests to assess RBC quality accurately and quickly. There is a need for measuring the health and quality of RBCs.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a method to asses health of RBCs through genetic signatures. This is intended to be used to identify unique RBC gene signatures. Specifically, this technology measures the expression of specific MicroRNAs and TransferRNAs (miRNAs and tRNAs) over time. Though RBCs do not have nuclei, they still contain short RNAs that can be sequenced to identify unique RBC gene signatures. Because expression of these RNA sequences increases with time, heightened RNA levels can be used to determine how long blood has been stored as well as the likelihood of development of lesions during storage. This can ensure that patients receiving blood transfusions are given high quality RBCs. This test also enables detection of genetic factors, like malaria resistance, and diseases, like sickle cell anemia, which can inform the transfusion processes. This patented technology has been demonstrated to detect MiRNAs and tRNAs in Western blots, multiplexed RNA samples, and in conjunction with high-throughput methods such as RNASeq.\n\nThis technology could also be used to detect blood doping, which is when athletes receive transfusions of their own blood to artificially increase blood oxygen and hemoglobin levels to boost performance. Blood doping is illegal and is currently detected by approximations informed through hemoglobin testing, which is not always the most accurate or reliable method.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Improved accuracy over hemoglobin testing: testing genetic material allows for more sensitive detection of blood cell age\n* Allows for high-throughput testing: can be paired with RNASeq to scale testing\n* Can improve transfusion efficacy: measurement of blood cell quality can maximize benefits of transfusions for patients and prevent unhealthy blood from being transfused",

    "ip_description": "Epithelial cells act as the body\u2019s first line of defense against foreign elements and are constantly being replaced by newly grown cells. Due in part to these factors, 90% of all cancers originate from epithelial cells, which form the linings of all organs and body cavities. Detecting precancerous growths in epithelial tissue is quite difficult, however, because they can develop across significant tissue surface area and depths in the body including hard to reach epithelium like those in the esophagus, cervix, and colon. One method to assess the health of epithelial tissues that has been employed by Duke researchers since 2006 is angle-resolved low coherence interferometry (a/LCI). A/LCI utilizes dynamic light scattering across a range of angles to measure and image cell nuclei in sub-surface layers. However, this method is challenging to use for detection in a large area because of its inherently small field of view. There is a need for an imaging modality with wide area scanning capabilities to improve precancerous growth detection beyond the visualization-limited microscopy methods currently used for assessing epithelial tissue.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a cost-effective, probe-based imaging system that uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) to find high risk areas of epithelium inside the body, and a subsequent a/LCI beam. Together, the OCT and custom a/LCI tools housed in application-specific apparatuses provide the ability to scan wide areas of tissue for precancerous growths. This is intended to be used by clinicians as a singular device to image areas of epithelium that are more difficult to assess, such as the esophagus or cervix. Specifically, a probe from the device is first inserted into the body next to the target epithelium, after which the system uses OCT imaging to determine if there are potential precancerous anomalies. Then, the system obtains high resolution images of the potential growths by scanning a/LCI beams across the target area. This has been demonstrated using full device prototypes deployed in clinical settings for endoscopic and cervical procedures to obtain wide area tissue images using a/LCI.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Scanning capabilities enable wide area imaging\n* Utilizes cheaper optical materials and device housing\n* Clinically demonstrated imaging of epithelium in the esophagus and cervix",

Many factors can contribute and cause obesity including diet, lack of exercise, genetics, medications, and psychological and socioeconomic factors. If reducing childhood obesity is not prioritized, individuals may develop life-long and chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol and blood pressure, breathing issues, and joint pain. Many pediatricians recommend increased physical activity and a healthier diet to reduce weight, but not all children have access to programs that enable these healthy habits. Therefore, there is a need for easily accessible community programs that support healthy lifestyles to prevent long term weigh issues and chronic conditions associated with childhood obesity.\n\nDuke inventors have developed an online tool that facilitates partnerships between local parks and recreation centers and pediatric primary care practices to provide a supportive and trustworthy environment for children to practice healthy habits close to home. This 6\u201312-month curriculum is termed the Fit Together Playbook and aims to improve weight status, quality of life, and self-confidence in overweight children 5-12 years old. Though the project targets overweight children, all are welcome to participate to foster healthy habits throughout the entire community. This is intended to be utilized by parks and recreational organizations and health centers to implement the program in their community. Specifically, the Fit Together Playbook includes tools to build partnerships between the organizations, complete necessary agreements, develop a referral system, hire staff, and sustain the program long term.

    "ip_description": "Duke inventors have developed a method to improve multiple myeloma (MM) immunomodulatory treatment. This is intended to be used in MM patients with co-existing diabetes and/or dyslipidemia. Specifically, the treatment method consists of a RXR (retinoid X receptor) modulator and an immunomodulatory agent. This has been demonstrated by investigating the effects of RXR modulators on the anti-myeloma activity of immunomodulatory agents as well as the level of glucose and lipids. The inventors found that RXR heterodimer agonists enhanced myeloma cells\u2019 sensitivity to immunomodulatory agents through in vitro cell studies and in vivo myeloma mouse models. They showed that administration of RXR agonists, such as LG100754, could be an effective strategy to overcome drug resistance in the treatment of MM, while providing additional benefits for patients with comorbidities, such as diabetes and/or dyslipidemia. The results provide a strong justification for future clinical trials to test the efficacy of RXR agonists in combination with immunomodulatory agents in MM patients. This technology could also be used for patients with other types of blood cancers, such as lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndrome, who are treated with immunomodulatory agents. Advantages include a novel approach for enhancing the efficacy of immunomodulatory agents using RXR modulators to treat blood cancers such as multiple myeloma, provides the first evidence that RXR heterodimer agonists are promising small-molecule drugs that can enhance the sensitivity of myeloma cells to immunomodulatory agents, and enables both anti-myeloma and glucose/lipid-level lowering effects.",

Over 20 million angiography and 10 million angioplasty procedures are projected to be performed in 2020. These procedures are performed under fluoroscopy guidance via the radial or the femoral artery. While radial access is associated with fewer complications and faster recovery times, it also exposes the operators to higher doses of radiation. Radiation exposure is still higher for procedures that require left-sided access given that the operators are required to work outside the range of the protective shields.

Specifically, this treatment is composed of inhibitors of a mechanically sensitive ion channel (Piezo1) and the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), which are both present in pancreatic stellate cell membranes. Under mechanical stress or injury, these protein channels secrete inflammatory molecules, such as interleukins and growth factors, as well as extracellular matrix proteins, which leads to fibrosis.

To combat tumor proliferation, this therapy is composed of Piezo1 and TRPV4 antagonists, which can be administered separately or in combination with each other and block their respective protein channels. Nonfunctional Piezo1 and TRPV4 channels prevent calcium from entering and activating the cell when they encounter mechanical stress, keeping them quiescent, a stage where they will not enhance tumor formation. Piezo1 and TRPV4 activation by mechanical stress has been demonstrated to lead to pancreatic tumor formation in vitro and in mouse models. This technology could also be used to treat other cancerous solid tumors such as lung, breast, gastric, colorectal, liver, and prostate tumors since TRPV4 has been shown to be involved in the formation and spread of these cancers. Advantages include: Novel treatment to prevent the spread of pancreatic cancer, Less invasive than current methods such as surgery, Mechanism of action demonstrated in vitro and in mice model.",

    "ip_description": "Glaucoma is an ocular disease involving heightened eye pressure most commonly leading to blindness, affecting roughly 3 million Americans. Current treatments include anti-steroidal or anti-inflammatory drugs to remove excess ocular fluid or decrease its production, lasers to drain eye fluid more precisely, and surgery to create conduits for fluid drainage. Glaucoma drainage device (GDD) implants are one such surgery-guided therapy which serve to shunt excess fluid from the front of the eye. However, these surgeries often cause inflammation and pain while also increasing intraocular swelling during healing. There is also low patient adherence on eye drop dosing (high drop burden), exacerbating undertreatment in large patient populations and rendering drug therapy ineffective. Thus, there is a need for new methods of mitigating surgery-induced complications and potentially improving patient adherence to eye drop/drug therapy.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a drug-infused hydrogel implant for use with GDD implants. This is intended to be used by surgeons during GDD implantation for the ~20% of glaucoma patients utilizing drainage devices for their treatment. Specifically, PEG hydrogel infused with a steroidal drug is implanted within the lumen of a GDD tube, after which the drug can diffuse slowly over time and reduce the need for patients to continually apply eye drops. This technology removes the need for a rip cord for tying off the GDD. This is an important differentiation as rip cords can lead to complications such as erosions within the conjunctiva and creating conduits for infection. However, the hydrogel implant can be used in conjunction with a rip cord if necessary, providing a fail-safe as a precaution. This has been demonstrated in vitro where the device was characterized for structural stability when subject to pressures equivalent to those observed in the eye. The inventors also demonstrated the successful integration of the rip cord into their device, to be used if needed.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Can reduce drop burden for glaucoma patients undergoing treatment\n* Localized steroid release prevents off-targets and can help prevent fibrosis at site of GDD\n* Surgical operating time is reduced based on lack of need for tube tying\n* Could infuse multiple drugs into the hydrogel to promote healing and fluid removal",

Metastasis can occur either at disease onset (6% of patients) or after treatment, which is called distant recurrence (13-41% of patients). There is a need for treatments to prevent metastasis from occurring in breast cancer patients as metastatic tumors are much more difficult to treat and therefore are more fatal. Duke inventors have developed an antibody targeting a T cell retention protein to prevent breast cancer tumor metastasis. This is intended to be in conjunction with chemotherapy to treat the primary tumor while working to suppress tumor metastases from forming. Specifically, Duke inventors have developed antibodies for programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and the migratory tumor cytokines CXCL16 and CXCR6 to prevent metastasis by the suppressing the target proteins and subsequent release of metastasis preventing T cells. This has been demonstrated successfully in live-animal models with mice and has shown to be quite effective and promising. Future work will focus on human models and improvements for clinical use. This technology could also be used for additional cancer types that are found to metastasize in similar manners.

    "ip_description": "For many years, ultrasound imaging has been an important and popular medical imaging method. The speckle texture in ultrasound images limits the detectability of low contrast targets. With size on the order of the system resolution, the speckle artifact is often a barrier to clinical diagnosis. A large number of beamforming and post-processing schemes are used in commercial ultrasound scanners to improve image resolution and target speckle texture. However, conventional beamforming methods typically have limited signal-to-noise ratio at depth and a narrow depth of field around the fixed transmit focus.\n\nInventors at Duke have reported a method for reducing speckle and improving resolution in ultrasound imaging. This invention is intended to be incorporated into existing technology to improve the detectability with ultrasound diagnostics. Specifically, this is an improved method for synthetic aperture beamforming that decomposes a set of focused transmit beams into their constituent components \u2013 diverging waves from individual array elements. The recovery of data from this set enables synthetic transmit focusing at all points in the field of view without beam shape or focal depth artifacts. The method is compatible with many existing technologies for image improvement including pulse sequencing, receive beamforming and image post-processing. The technique is well-suited for parallel processing architectures and beamforming software, which are increasingly common. This invention has been tested experimentally taking _in vivo_ images of human liver using existing commercial systems and has shown significantly improved transmit depth of field and signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nIn addition to speckle reduction, this technology could more generally be used for post-processing on the recovered aperture domain signals. This could include applications such as adaptive weightings and aberration correction.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Allows for ultrasound resolution improvement and speckle reduction without reducing acquisition rate, limiting active aperture extent or performing costly post-processing\n*   18% signal-to-noise ratio improvement in detectability of the low contrast target compared to speckle background\n*   Compatible with existing scanner architectures\n*   Has been tested experimentally using a commercial ultrasonic scanner\n*   Works flexibly with varying transmit focusing schemes\n*   Unlike many aperture coding schemes, it is also compatible with harmonic signals, which are clinically important for reducing clutter in images",

Primarily caused by a paternal chromosome 15q11-q13 deletion, PWS presents a myriad of physical, behavioral, and cognitive challenges that manifest throughout development. These include hypotonia (weak muscle tone), delayed growth, and feeding difficulties during infancy, followed by the onset of hyperphagia (insatiable hunger) in early childhood often leading to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Intellectual disability, learning impairments, stubbornness, anger, and obsessive-compulsive disorders are common behavioral and mental challenges. PWS additionally leads to underdeveloped genitals and incomplete puberty, resulting in sterility. Presently, there is no cure for PWS, and existing treatments address individual symptoms, necessitating a complex and burdensome regimen. There is a need for genetic therapies for PWS that can address the root cause of the disease and comprehensively mitigate the multitude of symptoms through a single treatment.\n\nDuke inventors have developed an epigenetic therapy for Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) using G9a (a histone H3 methyltransferase) small molecule inhibitors. This therapy is intended to be a pharmacological intervention administered to patients with PWS. Specifically, the G9a inhibitors are designed to prevent the methylation of H3K9 in PWS patients. This treatment enables the expression of otherwise silenced critical PWS associated genes from the maternal chromosome, compensating for the paternal deletion. These has been demonstrated through the identification of G9a inhibitors through high-content screening of over 9000 small molecules in cultured human fibroblast cells and further testing in both human fibroblasts and PWS mouse models.

    "ip_description": "The number of Americans with addiction-related disorders, including substance use disorders (SUD) and food addiction is increasing rapidly each year. Recent estimates indicate that >20 million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with an SUD and that 12-20% of individuals with obesity (>40% of the total population) meet diagnostic criteria for food addiction. The etiology of both chemical and food addiction is rooted in common neurobiology involving the 'reward' neurotransmitter dopamine. Accordingly, many appetite-regulating hormones are potent modulators of brain dopamine and strongly influence addictive behavior. The key appetite-stimulating hormone is ghrelin, which exerts its stimulatory effects on feeding and brain dopamine through its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) target \u2014 the ghrelin receptor GHSR. Unsurprisingly, most ghrelin-directed therapies to treat SUD or food addiction have attempted to _completely_ block (antagonize) GHSR activity, but this often leads to problematic side effects, including anorexia, weight/ muscle/ bone loss, glucose dysregulation, and elevated blood pressure. Thus, there is a need for new treatment strategies that selectively modulate GHSR pathways to prevent these undesirable side effects while retaining anti-addictive potential.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a small-molecule therapeutic candidate for the treatment of SUD and/or eating disorders such as food addiction. By selectively 'biasing' GHSR signaling, this novel compound is intended to improve anti-addictive efficacy while minimizes deleterious side effects. One GHSR signaling pathway through G proteins critically regulates endocrine and metabolic function; whereas, an alternate pathway through \u03b2-arrestin reinforces dopamine-dependent neuroplasticity and addictive behavior. Functionally selective (aka 'biased') ligands can be contrasted with current and past therapeutic candidates that activate/inhibit both pathways equally and thereby, often cause serious side effects or toxicity. This GHSR-selective, brain-penetrant therapeutic acts as a biased agonist towards the G protein pathway and diminishes \u03b2-arrestin-dependent cellular and behavioral effects. Thus, it allows normal endocrine/metabolic processes to occur while simultaneously curtailing dopamine-dependent reward. These advantageous characteristics have been demonstrated _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ using mouse models.\n\nThis technology can be used to treat a variety of conditions involving imbalances in brain dopamine and/or neurodegenerative disease. For example, its unique mechanism also makes it a promising therapeutic candidate for eating disorders (anorexia/cachexia, binge-eating disorder), alcohol use disorder, diabetes, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer's disease, and/or muscular atrophy, among others.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Selective and brain permeating GHSR ligand with a novel mechanism-of-action.\n- Potentially fewer side effects than past or current ghrelin/GHSR therapeutics through biased activation of G protein signaling over the \u03b2-arrestin pathway.\n- Wide range of potential indication areas, including addictions, eating disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases.",

Yet the mechanisms behind olfaction are not well understood, leading to impacts on a wide range of issues, from therapeutics to consumer products. Olfactory dysfunction (OD) takes a burdensome toll on over 13 million patients in the US alone. Olfactory dysfunction is primarily treated with olfactory training, in which the patient smells 4 essential odors daily to retrain the nose and brain. The essential odors were selected according to the odor prism hypothesis developed in 1916, and clinical outcomes would benefit from an updated understanding of how the properties of odorants relate to their perception. Whether arising from COVID, aging, or neurodegenerative disease, OD is associated with accelerated cognitive decline, depression, and situational hazards and safety concerns like fire or spoiled food. Additionally, olfaction is central to consumer decision-making. Retailers, manufacturers, and advertisers have long recognized the power of fragrances in product design and marketing. Worldwide fragrance sales totaled $58B in 2023. Yet despite olfaction\u2019s commercial, economic, and health importance, it is difficult to design better odorants due to the complex relationship between odorant structure and receptor response. There is a need for tools that enable the rational design of odorant molecules to deliver more effective products, marketing, and healthcare.\n\nDuke inventors have developed an odorant prediction platform that combines software predictions and in vitro assays for studying how odorants bind their corresponding receptors. Specifically, the software models odorant-receptor interaction based on the molecular properties of the odorant and the amino acid sequence of the receptor. These predictions can be tested empirically using in vitro assays. These tools are intended to be used in a research setting to design improved odorant molecules, identify natural alternatives to synthetic odorants, or design synthetic alternatives to natural ones. This technology has applications in consumer product development, such as fragrances, cleaning products, cosmetics, and therapeutics. Furthermore, it has potential applications in smell retraining therapy for patients with OD by improving therapeutic odorants. This technology has been demonstrated with data generated in live mice. A classifier trained on this data can predict receptor activation based on the molecular properties of a given odorant, even if that odorant was not included in the training data. The dataset used to train the classifier was generated by exposing live mice to a diverse panel of 52 odorants, one odorant at a time while measuring receptor activation.\n\nThis technology can also be used to design synthetic odorant receptors for artificial sensing systems used in healthcare diagnostics, product quality control, and chemical monitoring systems.

    "ip_description": "Glioblastoma is the most common type of malignant brain tumor, and accounts for 47.7% of all brain cancer cases. Despite aggressive treatment, the median overall survival for glioblastoma is 15 to 18 months. Currently, prognosis and treatment approaches are based on sets of robust biomarkers that define the type of glioblastoma. Two major biomarkers are the presence of mutations in the genes IDH, leading to widespread tumorigenic changes in the epigenome, and the promoter of TERT, which lead to increased TERT expression and telomerase activation to maintain telomeres. However, this set of biomarkers is unable to identify glioblastomas that do not have these mutations, which accounts for approximately 20% of all glioblastomas. These patients may therefore not receive optimal treatment given their disease biology may be different. There is a need for more comprehensive molecular markers for glioblastoma to improve personalized diagnosis and treatment, as well as aid research and development of novel therapeutics.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a set of biomarkers that identify subtypes of glioblastoma. This is intended to be used to identify the subtype of glioblastoma that is currently not captured by existing biomarkers and to aid in diagnosis and treatment. Specifically, Duke inventors have discovered that this previously undefined subset of glioblastoma had mutations outside of the classic glioblastoma biomarkers, the TERT promoter mutations and IDH mutations. These newly discovered mutations in this subgroup of glioblastoma have mutations which either moved TERT to another chromosomal position, altering the expression of TERT, or caused changes in other genes (ATRX or SMARCAL1) which activated a telomerase-independent mechanism of telomere maintenance known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). This has been demonstrated in whole genome and exome sequencing of tumor samples from glioblastoma patients and validated _in vitro_ using cell lines.\n\nThis technology could also be used to develop novel therapeutics for the treatment of glioblastoma.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Identifies new drug targets for glioblastoma.\n* Classifies a previously unclassifiable subset of glioblastoma.\n* Adds another modality to the treatment of glioblastoma.",

An estimated 1 in 50,000 births in the US are diagnosed with GSDIa. Patients experience life threatening low blood sugar, enlargement of the liver, and increased fat and urea in the blood. These symptoms can have long terms effects that include impaird growth, renal failure, and liver cancer. The current standard of care for GSDIa involves adding uncooked cornstarch to meals to help patients maintain normal blood sugar. Gene therapy has been explored as a potential treatment, however there have been problems with the duration of the therapeutic effect due to vector loss and unsustained transgene expression. There is a need for a safe, effective, and long-term genetic therapy for treatment of GSDIa to prevent the buildup of glycogen and give patients the ability to grow and live normally.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a novel gene therapy for GSDIa. This is intended to be used as a one-time, stand alone treatment to increase glucose-6-phosphatase function in GSDIa. Specifically, the technology uses CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing, delivered via a single adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, to expresses Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 and a donor vector that expresses a gRNA and G6PC transgene. Additionally, the drug bezafibrate was used to increase virus transduction, transgene expression, and editing efficacy due to the addition of a zinc finger nuclease.

Through their research, they have uncovered a novel link between GCGR ubiquitination and signaling bias. This is intended to be a fundamentally new perspective on how GCGR activation and subsequent signaling cascades are influenced by ubiquitination, improving our ability to design more targeted and effective therapies for diabetes and metabolic disorders. Specifically, they have identified that when the GCGR is ubiquitinated, it signals through G protein coupling as well as through \u03b2arrestin1-dependent mechanisms. On the other hand, when the GCGR is in a deubiquitinated state, which can be caused due to a mutation of lysine 333, its signaling is biased toward a \u03b2arrestin1-dependent p38 MAPK pathway and activity. This has been demonstrated primarily in in vitro experiments and cellular assays. The inventors demonstrate advancement in the understanding of GCGR-mediated signaling and open the door to further research that could potentially lead to the development of more targeted and effective therapies for diabetes and metabolic disorders. This technology, which identifies a novel link between GCGR ubiquitination status and signaling bias, could have broader applications in various areas of biomedical research and drug development. The identified connection will allow researchers to uncover similar mechanisms in different signaling pathways.

    "ip_description": "Cancer remains to be a heavy burden on Americans as many current gold-standard treatments can be ineffective. In 2022, an estimated 623,000 Americans were living with metastatic cancer and is predicted to increase to about 693,000 by 2025. This increasing disease prevalence as well as increased diagnoses and research for treatments is causing a dramatic increase in the market by 17% in the next 7 years. Some forms of cancer hijack proteins that activate immune cells, preventing the body from recognizing the cancer and allowing it to proliferate undetected. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy demonstrates significant promise as an effective treatment method against this characteristic. Inhibitors in ICI therapy interact with hijacked proteins, returning them to their normal function. This causes immune cells to recognize and attack the cancer cells. Though 43% of patients are eligible depending on cancer type and stage, only about 12% of patients experience no further tumor growth after treatment with ICI therapy. Because of this low efficacy, there is a need for molecules to enhance ICI therapy, making it more effective in more patients. Duke inventors have identified two novel inhibitors that, when administered with a current ICI therapy, increase the efficacy. This is intended as a treatment method for patients that are unresponsive or have become unresponsive to ICI therapy. Specifically, identified two molecules with novel targets that increased the efficacy of anti-PD1 ICI therapy when administered in combination. In mouse models, this novel combination therapy significantly enhanced lung tumor growth delay and extended life by three times compared to mice only treated with classic ICI therapy alone without the novel inhibitors. This technology could be used to treat solid or liquid tumors. Advantages include: More effective ICI therapy in patients when used in combination with the novel inhibitors than when administered alone.

Of these affected births, a third take the form of infantile-onset disease, occurring within the first few months of life and more severe than late-onset disease. Treatment for Pompe disease currently uses enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to provide a recombinant version of the acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme to the patient, restoring the ability to covert glycogen in the body to simple sugar molecules. While ERT prolongs survival in Infantile-onset disease, residual motor weakness remains. Alternative treatment methods using viral vector delivered gene therapy are being developed for adults. However, these approaches lose efficacy in patients with infantile-onset disease due to a growing liver and the formation antibodies to the viral vectors which prevent re-administration of therapy. There is a need for effective and long-term genetic therapies for early life treatment of Pompe disease to prevent the progressive loss of muscle function in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a novel gene therapy for Pompe disease.

The resulting health burden costs the US healthcare system an estimated $25 billion annually and is only expected to rise in the future. Currently, topically applied activated protein C (APC) is a primary treatment available for chronic wounds. While use of Factor VIIa is a common treatment for hemophilia-related surgical or trauma-related bleeding, it could potentially be another treatment chronic wounds, though it remains currently untested clinically.\n\nBoth APC and FVIIa improve chronic wounds through mechanisms that induce anti-inflammatory signaling pathways, inhibit pro-inflammatory factors, and maintain vascular barrier integrity. However, in their current forms, both treatments have significant limitations. APC can interfere with hemostasis required for wound closing, increasing long-term inflammation. FVIIa, on the other hand, can induce a burst of pro-inflammatory factors and reduce the integrity of the vascular barrier during the process of hemostasis. As such, there is a need for therapeutic agents that not only stabilize the vascular barrier but also improve hemostasis in a targeted and effective manner.\n\nDuke inventors have developed novel chimeric variants of FVIIa to treat chronic wounds and associated prolonged inflammation. These are intended to be used as an effective dose of chimeric FVIIa delivered by a clinician as either a topical treatment, an intravenous or subcutaneous injection, or a therapeutic formulation. The therapy can be intended as a treatment for wounds, inflammation, or hemorrhagic conditions as well as for preventing cell-death.

Specifically, the inventors have developed a suite of fluorescently responsive biosensors based on engineered ligand-binding proteins derived from bacteria. These biosensors can accurately determine analyte concentrations continuously or episodically using small samples by direct contact and do not require multiple, additional reagents. Furthermore, the sensors are typically based on thermophilic proteins, and therefore are robust. These features enable simple, low-cost fabrication, distribution, and operation.\n\nTo date, biosensors have been developed to detect the levels of various analytes including glucose, lactate, galactose, glutamate, urea, bicarbonate, calcium, creatinine, chloride, and potassium. The suite of available analytes is extensible by a bioinformatic discovery process of new ligand-binding proteins devised by the inventors. The single fluorophores incorporated into the biosensors report on analyte concentrations by detecting local internal protein conformations, via a mechanism determined by the inventors. Conversion of a ligand-binding protein into a fluorescently responsive biosensor is achieved by protein design methodologies created by the inventors. This fluorescent response mechanism encodes an analyte-dependent color switch, resulting in self-calibrating ratiometric signals.

T-cell-based immunotherapies encompass chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and other _ex vivo_ engineered immune cells for re-infusion into the patient and subsequent honing and targeting of cancer cells. However, many of these T cell therapies have limited efficacy in solid cancers such as glioblastoma, where barriers like tumor heterogeneity, restricted trafficking and infiltration, and T cell exhaustion prevent tumor cell cytotoxicity. Intra-tumoral heterogeneity is a primary barrier to T cell therapy, as many cancers possess few and variable tumor specific-antigens making targeting of one protein less effective. Thus, the development of superior T cell therapies requires more pan-cancer targets that result in optimal efficacy.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a chimeric apoptotic signal targeting lymphocyte (CASTL) specific for a phospholipid exposed on the surface of tumor cells. This is intended to be used for glioblastoma patients, and potentially other solid cancer types, for whom conventional treatment fails, or possibly as an adjuvant with radiotherapy. Specifically, the engineered T cells use an extracellular protein named TIM-4 to target phosphatidylserine (PS). TIM-4 can strongly bind PS that is exposed on the extracellular surface of tumor cells. PS exposure is typically immune inhibiting so, the inventors utilize T cell activation moieties in the targeting construct to bypass inhibition effects and promote killing. This has been demonstrated in murine cancer cell lines including for glioblastoma and melanoma, highlighting the applicability of the technology to multiple cancer types. TIM-4 CASTLs were shown to kill tumor cells significantly better than non-TIM-4 CASTLs and other antigen-targeting CAR T cells. They were also shown to synergize with irradiation, whereby binding and cytotoxicity of tumor cells by TIM-4 CASTLs increased when administered after radiation therapy.\n\nThis technology could also be used for other solid cancers for which intra-tumor heterogeneity represents a barrier to therapy efficacy.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Phospholipid-targeting rather than protein-targeting is broader, thus avoiding drawbacks of antigen-specific CAR T cell therapy\n* Efficacy synergy with radiotherapy motivates its use as an adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma\n* Potential to mask immune tolerance for tumor-intrinsic non-CASTL cytotoxic T cells",

Approximately 50% of the US population over the age of 45 is expected to have preclinical heart failure, and current techniques to identify those who will progress to advanced heart failure are limited.

There is a need for therapeutics that are more effective at treating heart failure directly rather than alleviating symptoms. Duke inventors have developed a humanized antibody that is intended to be used for therapeutic, diagnostic, and prognostic applications related to heart failure. Specifically, the antibody binds to pro-N-cadherin. The researchers have previously observed that defective processing of N-cadherin leads to expression of pro-N-cadherin on myofibroblasts and intercalated discs during heart failure. This antibody has been demonstrated to reverse doxorubicin-induced heart failure in guinea pig studies. Advantages include: A humanized antibody that could address unmet needs in the heart failure, including as a therapeutic or prognostic (see related Duke technology T-007947); More specific than existing therapies so expected to create fewer severe side effects; Demonstrated reversal of heart failure in animal models.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Currently, the agriculture industry relies on broad-spectrum antibiotics to ensure high crop yields, but farmers still suffer losses of 17-30% to disease and blight. Furthermore, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat these diseases leads to environmental antibiotic resistance, which can in turn create antibiotic-resistant human diseases and decimate beneficial microbes that maintain nutrient levels in soil. Bacterial pests are particularly devastating in fruit orchards, where trees are planted close together, allowing diseases to spread easily. One such disease, fire blight, causes great annual losses for apple growers and restricts the geographic locations of sustainable pear production. Additionally, kiwi bacterial canker, is a serious, emerging, pandemic disease which almost destroyed kiwi industry in New Zealand. Thus, more selective antimicrobial treatments are needed to prevent crop deaths from bacterial plant diseases.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a class of selective antimicrobials that target and eliminate bacterial plant diseases including fire blight and kiwi bacterial diseases. These are intended to be used by growers to treat orchards and large-scale farms to prevent the spread of fire blight and kiwi bacterial diseases and increase crop yields. Specifically, the polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer is a small molecule that targets the largest family of pore-forming virulence proteins that are found in a variety of bacterial plant pathogens belonging to _Erwinia_ spp., _Dickeya_ spp., _Pantoea_ spp. _Pectobacterium_ spp., and all _Pseudomonas syringae_ pathovars, which collectively cause disease in virtually all crop plant species. The molecule\u2019s branched shape is wide enough to simply block the pore hole, thereby preventing the pathogenic action of this key family of virulence proteins_._ This has been demonstrated to be effective in stopping Erwinia amylovoa, which causes fire blight, as well as a _Pseudomonas syringae_ strain that simulates kiwi bacterial canker-causing agent. Unlike nonspecific antibiotics, current data shows that these molecules are not active against plants or the microbiome, limiting the ability for resistance to spread and ensuring its specificity to plant pathogens.\n\nBecause pore-forming virulence factors are produced by many bacterial, fungal and oomycete pathogens, this technology, based on the concept of inhibition of microbial pores, has potential to be used to treat many other plant (and animal/human) pathogens in addition to fire blight and kiwi bacterial canker disease. Further research is needed.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Works during active infection only, preventing resistance and overuse\n*   More selective than broad spectrum antibiotics, prevents environmental antibiotic resistance\n*   Does not kill beneficial soil bacteria as broad-spectrum antibiotics do",

PATs cells are enriched in human fibrotic lungs and have been implicated in the initiation and progression of the disease.

Additionally, researchers are considering RBPs as therapeutic targets for previously difficult-to-treat diseases like certain cancers. While there are several current methods for studying RBPs and their interactions with RNA, their usability and scalability is limited due to their low-throughput nature, low recovery of RNA-protein complexes, high cost, and the limited availability of the antibodies that these methods rely on.

This treatment would be administered by physicians treating _Rb1_-deficient metastatic prostate cancer patients for whom conventional treatments fail. Specifically, Duke inventors demonstrated that _Rb1_-deficient cancer cells are particularly sensitive to an oxidative cell death called ferroptosis, which can be induced by several chemical compounds as potential treatment. By selectively depleting retinoblastoma protein (RB), the inventors observed sensitization of prostate cancer cells to induction of ferroptosis. Depleting RB from _Rb1_-intact cancer cell lines from a range of other histological origins, including the lung, liver, and breast _in vitro_ also sensitized them to ferroptosis. The same result was observed _in vivo_ with cell-derived xenograft models. In pre-clinical mouse models, the inventors demonstrated minimal toxicity of ferroptosis inducer JKE-1674 and specificity for _Rb1_-deficient tumors. They also reported therapeutic efficacy of ferroptosis induction in _PTEN_/_Rb1_ double knockout mice \u2013 a genotype commonly observed in late-stage human prostate cancer such as castration-resistant prostate adenocarcinoma and treatment-emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer.

Although these are prevalent diseases, the cause is complex, and there is currently no approved treatment other than lifestyle change or liver transplant. Therefore, there is a great unmet need to develop treatment methods for NAFLD/NASH that can simultaneously target all the effected pathways in liver fibrosis. Duke inventors have developed a gene therapy for Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and associated disorders. This is intended to treat patients with severe obesity and liver fibrosis. Specifically, microRNA 375 (miR-375), a little-studied modulator for a number of downstream gene expression pathways, has been observed to be enriched in livers in severely obese individuals carrying the PNPLA3 risk allele for NASH that are resistant to the disease. By introducing genetic material coding for the upregulation or expression of miR-375 or a mimic, a gene therapy approach could be used to treat NAFLD/NASH and severe obesity. The enrichment of miR-375 has been demonstrated in both human liver biopsy data and validated with small RNA-seq. Treatment with AAV encoding miR-375 reversed liver inflammation and lowered total liver mass and lipid content in mice with established NASH. This technology could also apply to patients with other associated conditions such as hepatic fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatitis C induced NAHS, drug induced NASH, and NASH risk factors such as obesity-related diabetes, heart failures, and clotting disorders. Advantages: There are currently no effective treatment methods for NAFLD/NASH, as the only options for patients are lifestyle change and liver transplant, so there is no approved market competition.

Global PCR, isothermal amplification, DNA sequencing, and reverse transcription markets are estimated to have a net value of $46.6 billion in 2025.

    "ip_description": "Cancer immunotherapy provides great advantages over traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation with more durable clinical outcomes and an improved quality of life. The number of US patients eligible for immunotherapy was estimated to be 43.6% in 2018. However, as response rates vary by both patient and specific type of cancer, only 12.5% of eligible people were estimated to respond. With cancer immunotherapies increasing in use, biomarkers that can predict patient response rates and identify patients likely to respond to immunotherapies are in great need. While some predictive biomarkers currently exist on the market \u2013 such as PD-L1, microsatellite instability (MSI), and defective mismatch repair (dMMR), they are specific to a limited number of cancer types. There is a need for additional biomarkers that can predict patient response to cancer immunotherapy while being non-invasive, low-cost, and easily implementable.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a blood test to measure function of peripheral immune cells to predict responsiveness of tumors to cancer immunotherapy. This is intended to be used as a diagnostic test by physicians to determine if immunotherapy would be appropriate for a given patient. Specifically, this technology uses peripheral blood samples obtained from patients to determine tumor response to innate immune adjuvants. The inventors show that patient monocytes that displayed a positive response to the immune adjuvant in blood were also found to demonstrate a robust response to the adjuvant in the tumor. Thus, peripheral blood immune function can be an indicator of tumor responsiveness to immunotherapy. This has been demonstrated _in vivo_ using blood and tumor samples from patients with pancreatic cancer, melanoma, or intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms.\n\nThis technology could also help identify if standard of care treatment currently being used in patients compromises their innate and adaptive immune system which can make the tumor less responsive to cancer immunotherapy and accelerate its progression.\n\nAdvantages:\n* A novel, non-invasive, low-cost, and easily implementable blood test for predicting patient response to cancer immunotherapies\n* Can be tailored to the needs of a patient\u2019s immune function reducing healthcare costs associated with blanket therapies\n* Enables long-term monitoring of tumor progression and immune status",

    "ip_description": "The human population is growing, and more food will be needed to sustain the global community, with an expected increase in total global food demand of 35% to 56% in the next 25 years. However, optimizing crop production is nontrivial and is becoming more difficult as climate change continues to increase both global temperature and the frequency of periods of elevated temperature (ET). ET renders plants more susceptible to pathogen infection, which ultimately sacrifices plant growth as part of a programmed growth-defense trade-off. Therefore, agriculture workers tend to use pesticides to suppress plant immunity and chemically ablate pathogens, thus allowing crops to focus on growth. Unfortunately, overuse of pesticides is common in agriculture and negatively impacts plant biodiversity, local ecology, soil microbes, and potentially the health of humans consuming these crops. While genetically encoded disease resistance is another method used to prevent infection, these genetic modifications are often less effective at ET. Thus, there is a need for new methods to preserve and improve plant immunity to pathogens.\n\nDuke inventors have identified a protein that can ensure effective plant immunity not only at normal growth temperatures during but also during periods of ET, without compromising plant growth. This is intended to be administered to crops through modifying the promoter of a key immune regulator which is conserved in diverse plant species. Specifically, Duke inventors discovered that the recruitment of a transcription factor to target genes involved in the production of a major plant defense hormone, salicylic acid (SA), is specifically suppressed during ET. They further found that expression of this transcription factor gene is a rate-limiting step in SA production at ET. Finally, they showed that optimized expression of this gene broadly restored SA production, basal immunity and R gene-mediated immunity while maintaining appropriate growth qualities. Optimized expression, as opposed to constitutive and therefore growth-suppressing expression, was achieved using an inducible \u201cuORF\u201d system which only initiates in plants upon pathogen encounter. This has been demonstrated in _Arabidopsis thaliana_ and begin to be demonstrated in a major oil crop _Brassica napus_. They also showed that temperature-sensitive pathogen defense was improved when exposed to pathogens which induce basal immunity or R gene-mediated immunity \u2013 immune reactions commonly provoked to guard crops against pathogens and insects. Further work is required to assess the effect of expression of the optimized target gene in other commonly grown crops and a wide range of pathogens.\n\nThis technology could also be used for protecting several other crops such as rice, rapeseed, tobacco, and numerous other crops which are known to utilize SA to fight infection. The identified target gene is also a master transcription factor which regulates a multitude of processes of plant immunity. Thus, this invention could be used to finetune specific immune processes to better equip crops with pathogen protection at both current and future (warm) climates.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   First-in-class genetic approach to combat pathogens without compromising growth or temperature sensitivity\n*   Potentially applicable to many crops commonly affected by ET\n*   Broad effects of the _CBP60g_ transcription factor to improve plant immunity\n*   Novel target for thermosensitive plant immunity\n*   Preserved plant immunity negates need for pesticides",

Alzheimer\u2019s disease affects over 6 million people in the United States. There is currently no effective therapy. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is believed to be caused by the accumulation of tau proteins and A\u03b2 plaques. In a healthy brain, AQP4 naturally clears these plaques from the brain via the glymphatic system. In the brain of an Alzheimer\u2019s patient, however, AQP4 is dysregulated, disrupting this glymphatic clearance and resulting in the accumulation of plaques. There is a need for a therapy which restores the glymphatic clearance of A\u03b2 plaques.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a novel gene therapy to clear tau proteins and A\u03b2 plaques from the brain of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

DCIS is considered noninvasive, as abnormal cells have not spread out of the milk duct. However, the treatment for DCIS is often aggressive to prevent the possible spread of these abnormal cells. Women may undergo breast-conserving surgery, radiation, or a mastectomy. In anywhere between 50%\u201375% of cases, these invasive treatments are excessive and unnecessary, putting patients through an often painful and traumatic process. There is a need for a suite of genetic markers that can differentiate whether a person is high risk or low risk for breast cancer progression to avoid unnecessary treatment.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a genomic classifier that distinguishes high risk from low-risk breast precancer. This is intended to be used by doctors diagnosing and staging breast cancer after DCIS has been detected. Specifically, Duke inventors have developed and validated a classifier that is able to predict the risk of overall recurrence and invasive progression of DCIS. This has been demonstrated through the identification of RNA expression patterns in DCIS tissue that correlate with later stage invasive breast cancer (IBC). Researchers identified a Random Forest classifier that was trained using 812 genes, which successfully predict either no later event or an ipsilateral breast event (iBE), which is a recurrent in situ or invasive carcinoma, after surgical treatment. The classifier predicts both recurrence and invasive progression. Researchers also found the high-risk subset was characterized by the activation of certain pathways including cell proliferation, immune response, and metabolism. The classifier was validated on a second dataset, indicating that it performed well across datasets with diverse race/ethnicities, geographical locations, median years of diagnosis, and time to recurrence.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Prevents overtreatment of DCIS\n- Helps women avoid invasive and potentially painful and traumatic treatment if not necessary\n- Predictive power across diverse datasets that is not observed in commercially available prognostic tests for DCIS",

These patients often undergo neurosurgery to help alleviate their symptoms. Surgical planning involves taking extensive structural, functional, and electrical scans of the brain to identify a region to remove during surgery, known as the resection area. Compared to other forms of neurosurgery, where abnormal growths or tumors can be easily identified and removed during the procedure, implementation of surgical approaches to treating epilepsy are particularly challenging because the area for resection cannot be identified by the naked eye. Additionally, the area must be removed precisely to prevent damage to healthy brain tissue. The current approach to identifying the resection area during surgery involves visualizing 2D slices of brain scans on external monitors and mentally cross-referencing these images with 3D patient anatomy, which can be extremely challenging. Therefore, there is a need for a technology that can provide surgeons with intuitive, informative, 3D renderings of the patient\u2019s brain during surgery, in real time. Duke inventors have developed a technology that uses headset-mounted augmented reality to help surgeons visualize preoperative plans in a sterile and interactive manner during neurosurgery.

Despite accounting for only 3.2% of all cancer cases, it is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) combined with chemotherapy as the first-line treatment for locally advanced tumors. For all its clinical benefits, EBRT possesses significant limitations in the clinical management of pancreatic cancer which contribute to a 5 -year survival rate of less than 11.5% for patients with loco-regionalized pancreatic tumors. Therefore, there remains a need for new compositions and treatment methods that can overcome the disadvantages of convention solid tumor treatment for patients suffering from pancreatic cancer.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a radiotherapy drug delivery technology intended to improve the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. This is a synergistic treatment strategy that combines chemotherapeutics with a liquidly injectable biopolymer that delivers radiotherapies. The approach relies on the thermally responsive properties of an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) to deliver continuous, \u03b2-emission therapy using radionuclides.

Situations such as these are not only a disservice to those seeking medical attention, but to the medical professionals who are overworked and, in some cases, have the devastating task of turning people away. Luckily, many emergency department patients may be eligible to receive care and treatment in their own homes, decreasing the demand for inpatient requests.

    "ip_description": "Over the last 40 years, the number of hospitals and hospital beds in the U.S. has declined, while the demand for emergency department services has increased. As a result, emergency department crowding has not only become a huge challenge, but a health risk as one assessment found crowding to be associated with higher mortality in 45% of studies, decreased quality of care in 75%, and an overall worse perception of care in 100% of the studies. The demand for emergency department services is likely to only increase, making the necessity for improved and efficient patient flow all the greater. One of the untapped possibilities is knowing how critical a patient\u2019s condition is and the likelihood of the condition escalating. There is a need for an accurate, efficient, and objective way of triaging patients such that those who are in a stable condition and able to wait for services and those who need immediate care are identified.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a software that can predict an individual emergency department (ED) patient\u2019s needs and move them to the appropriate location within the hospital system. This is intended to be used in emergency departments, particularly by the charge nurses who are tasked with admitting patients and directing them to either inpatient or Intensive Care Units. Specifically, this software is a machine learning model that collects the historical and in-visit data of a patient and outputs their likelihood of admission to a live database that is monitored by a health practitioner. The patient\u2019s in-visit data is collected every hour such that if a patient\u2019s condition has changed, the likelihood of admission will as well. In this way, nurses who assign patients to beds can plan and make beds more readily available, operation administrators can make more informed decisions around staffing and material resource needs, and health professionals can more quickly identify patients who need immediate attention to begin administering care. This has been demonstrated with a dataset involving over 450,000 encounters and a validation dataset of over 150,000 encounters. The model was able to correctly predict over 80% of inpatient admissions and over 90% of ICU admissions based on numerous patient input data. The top 5 features for predicting inpatient admission were age, white blood cell count, hematocrit, length of stay for discharged ED visits, and platelet count. The top 5 features for predicting ICU admission were age, hematocrit, white blood cell count, number of discharges from ED, and emergency severity index (ESI) score.\n\nThis technology could also identify patients who qualify for at-home care or a Hospital at Home program. This allows individuals to receive medical attention in the comfort of their home if their condition is not critical. In turn, this frees up hospital beds for patients who need the constant supervision of medical staff.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Provides close to real-time analytics with a likelihood of admission output updated every hour\n* Efficient and objective way of identifying medical needs of patients\n* Cost effective method for planning staff and material resource needs\n* Includes details for implementing machine learning models in clinical setting",

A new Duke technology implements real-time adaptive scanning using a probabilistic approach to balance the re-imaging of known dynamic positions with exploration to identify undiscovered dynamic positions.

    "ip_description": "For individuals experiencing chronic pain, day-to-day tasks and activities can become difficult or impossible. It can also lead to other long-term health challenges including insomnia, stress, anxiety, and depression. Chronic pain is so pervasive, it is thought to affect approximately 25% of adults in the U.S. and accounts for over 20% of all doctor visits. Treatment of chronic pain is limited to light relief, such as is found in over-the-counter topical ointments, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and muscle relaxers, to stronger drugs such as medical marijuana and opioids. Although effective in relieving pain, opioids have become a tremendous public health crisis due to their addictive properties and diminishing effectiveness with prolonged use. There is a need for non-addictive pain treatments that substantially reduce discomforts and improve the quality of life in patients who suffer from chronic pain.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a small molecule, SBI-553, that alleviates chronic pain-associated behaviors in mice without being addictive. This molecule is intended to be used in situations of debilitating chronic pain when opioids are often prescribed, such as with former military personnel who have experienced combat-related trauma and musculoskeletal injuries. Specifically, researchers have harnessed neurotensin receptor 1\u2019s (NTSR1) ability to alleviate pain while selectively blocking the side effects through a beta-arrestin-biased NTSR1 modulator (SBI-553). Neurotensin receptors are found in pain circuits of the central nervous system and have long been investigated for their pain alleviation potential. Typical activation of NTSR1 results in adverse side effects such as hypotension, hyperthermia, motor impairment and other life-threatening conditions. Now, with the beta-arrestin-biased NTSR1 ligand (SBI-553), the analgesic effects of NTSR1 can be activated, while eliminating these usual negative side effects. This has been demonstrated in male mice experiencing neuropathic chronic pain induced by paclitaxel, a chemotherapy agent. Four weeks after paclitaxel treatment, male mice were injected with a low dose of SBI-553. For over 24 hours, male mice showed a decrease in pain level by two metrics, an increase in the paw withdrawal threshold and increased time on the treadmill. Mechanical allodynia, or pain caused by slight stimuli such as a light touch, was reduced in mice injected with higher doses of SBI-553. SBI-553 also blocks the rewarding effects of psychostimulant drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, and opioids. At doses that reduce allodynia and blunt drug reward-related behaviors in mice, SBI-553 did not change body temperature or blood pressure.\n\nThis technology could also alleviate acute pain.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Non-opioid treatment for chronic pain via a long-investigated NTSR1 mechanism\n* Reduces side effects associated with addictive drugs such as reward and motor enhancing effects\n* Uses long sought-after neurotensin mechanism while bypassing the usual side effects associated with NTSR1 agonists, such as hypotension, hyperthermia, and motor impairment",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Angiography is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the inside of blood vessels and organs of the body. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new non-invasive imaging technique of the retinal microvessel (smallest system of blood vessels in the body) that employs motion contrast imaging to high-resolution volumetric blood flow information. It generates angiographic images in a matter of seconds. Currently, only table top OCTA systems are commercially available. These systems require a compliant seated patient, leaving OCTA unavailable to several patient populations including young children and other patients not able to cooperate with head placement and ocular fixation, such as bed-ridden patients or intra-operative use. Typically, these patients are imaged with hand held systems but the line rate of current hand-held systems (20 kHz) is too slow to support the high density, repeated scans needed for OCTA. This new Duke technology uses a custom, lightweight, hand-held OCT probe based on a high-speed swept source engine for imaging in the intensive care nursery. The probe uses custom optics, optomechanics, and a MEMS mirror to achieve a weight of only 211g. The portability and imaging speed of this probe facilitates repeat, volumetric, bedside imaging in a challenging imaging environment. To date, there are over 43 pre-term and full-term infants imaged in the intensive care nursery, with some patients having up to 15 imaging sessions starting at 30 weeks post menstrual age. Volumetric OCT enables visualization of the complex 3D structures associated with retinal pathology that is unavailable to slower, B-scan based probes. Repeat imaging shows the development of both normal and diseased retinal structures. It is believed that OCT imaging of these infants will reveal retinal abnormalities, enable further study of pediatric retinal diseases, and allow for better management and prediction of future visual outcomes. Advantages: * Able to image bedridden patients such as infants * The probe is ergonomic, easier to hold and stabilize * High-speed imaging * Can be moved without the restricted degrees of freedom from the armature * The system is easier to align and image with both axially and laterally * Allows easier imaging and monitoring of retinal diseases",

Ophthalmologists now routinely employ OCT in managing ocular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and corneal edema. However, OCT imaging is restricted to non-urgent evaluations of cooperative patients in ophthalmology care settings due to modern systems\u2019 poor portability, stabilization needs, and operator skill requirements. Efforts are underway to lower these barriers, but the resulting solutions still depend on chinrests for approximate alignment and motion stabilization or are limited by manual alignment and motion artifacts, such that only highly skilled operators with steady hands reliably succeed. There is a need for improved systems and techniques for acquiring eye images, including image of the eye\u2019s anterior segment and retina that can permit an image scanner to be easily interfaced with the patient without operator training. Further, there is a need to provide OCT imaging to acutely ill patients who physically cannot sit upright due to injury, strict bedrest, or loss of consciousness.\n\nDuke inventors have developed an optical system intended to make OCT imaging more accessible, including for bedbound or unconscious patients. Specifically, this is a robotically aligned swept-source OCT scanner capable of automatically imaging eyes without chinrests. The scanner features eye tracking from fixed-base RGB-D cameras for coarse and stereo pupil cameras for fine alignment, as well as galvanometer aiming for fast lateral tracking, reference arm adjustment for fast axial tracking, and a commercial robot arm for slow lateral and axial tracking. The technology has been demonstrated to offer highly repeatable imaging of stationary and moving eyes up to 30 mm s-1 using a mannequin outfitted with model eyes.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Robotically aligned OCT scanner that does not require operator intervention\n- Enables a large functional workspace without compromising fine alignment\n- Demonstrates potential for imaging eyes without chinrests with sub-millimeter eye tracking accuracy, 12 \u03bcm lateral pupil tracking accuracy, 83.2 ms stabilization time following step disturbance, and 9.7 Hz tracking bandwidth",

Studying these circuits sheds valuable insight into healthy neurons and neuronal disfunction. Disfunction of neural circuits are thought to play a role in numerous human brain disorders, including degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Parkinson\u2019s Disease, as well as psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and depression. With the global neurological therapeutics market forecasted to reach almost $40 billion in 2024, it\u2019s imperative that the best tools are used to study, and develop, better therapeutics. Current technologies for studying neural circuits can be unspecific, difficult to scale, and cumbersome to record and analyze data. There is a need for cell specific, scalable, neural recording technologies with simple data collection and analysis. The recording technology should also allow for durable continuous recordings of single neurons, and neural circuits, in freely behaving animal models.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a method of binding specific neurons to custom electrodes to allow for better observation of neural circuits. This protein-ligand capture technology is intended to be used as a research tool to aid in the covalent attachment of neurons to an innovative new type of coating for electrophysiology recording electrodes. Specifically, novel chemical derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene monomers were synthesized to contain a HaloTag Ligand (PEDOT-HTL). The HaloTag Protein (HTP) is transfected into a neuronal population, causing a HTP ligand to be expressed on the surface of the neurons. This facilitates covalent binding of the specific neuronal population expressing HTP to the PEDOT-HTL electrodes. This covalent capture technology can improve signal to noise ratio by allowing for amplified signal due to the closeness of the neuron to the electrode, and reduced noise due to the insulation of the electrode from the attached neurons. This has been demonstrated _in vitro_ with rat hippocampal neuronal cultures on custom coated multielectrode arrays. An _in vivo_ approach is also being developed with implanted electrode arrays to allow for recording in freely moving animal models.\n\nThis technology could also be scaled up for high-throughput electrophysiological screening applications.

Neural activity recording requires the ability to simultaneously record thousands of neurons with millisecond resolution and knowledge of each cell\u2019s genetic identity. However, no recording technology encompassing all these features is currently available. Current technologies such as electrodes and genetically encoded activity indicators are slow, have limited stability, and can only record a few neurons at a time. In addition, current tools are not compatible with neural activity recording in freely-behaving animals. To overcome these technological barriers, there is a need for an inexpensive, scalable method for simultaneous recording of many genetically defined neurons with millisecond precision.\n\nDuke inventors have engineered an electroconductive polymer that covalently attaches neurons to electrodes.

    "ip_description": "Eye surgery is a high-impact intervention necessary to preserve the sight of thousands of patients, with retinal detachment surgeries alone constituting approximately 28,000 cases per year in the United States alone. Microscope-integrated optical coherence tomography (MIOCT), which combines standard two-dimensional (2D) color microscopy with three-dimensional (3D) optical coherence tomography imaging (OCT), has emerged as a promising intrasurgical imaging technique to improve real-time guidance for major eye surgeries. However, in the current embodiment, visualizations for each mode are displayed separately, requiring surgeons to mentally align and compare features across both images. There is a need for new methods to combine information from both modalities into a single reconstruction in order to provide surgical guidance superior to that of separate visualizations, which should lead to better outcomes.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a method for fusing data from 2D color microscopy and 3D OCT, yielding a more efficient visualization of cues from each. This is intended to be used by ophthalmic surgeons for image-guided eye surgeries, as well as for non-surgical applications where 2D color imaging data and 3D imaging data can be combined to enhance visualization for clinicians. Specifically, the method works by receiving 3D imaging data from OCT and 2D color imaging data of a region of interest. The 3D imaging data is segmented using either manual or automatic methods to identify anatomical features in the region of interest. Next, an image is generated by using a rendering process based on the volumetric distribution of color emission and density to fuse the 2D color data and the 3D imaging data according to the surfaces, the corresponding volumes, and identities of the anatomical features. Ultimately, this process leads to a single visualization that integrates information from each modality. This technology has been demonstrated using images previously acquired during surgery.\n\nThis technology could also be applied to many other multimodal imaging combinations, including, but not limited to, structural 3D sweptsource OCT (SSOCT), limited to time-domain OCT (TD-OCT), spectral-domain OCT (SDOCT), OCT angiography (OCT-A), color fundus 2D data, fluorescence imaging, hyperspectral imaging, scanner laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO), adaptive optics SLO (AO-SLO), confocal microscopy, polarization-sensitive-OCT (PS-OCT), spectral OCT (SOCT), and ultrasound.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Integrates information from both 2D color microscopy and 3D OCT imaging in a single, easy to understand visualization\n* Fused visualization of data will provide surgical guidance superior to that of separate visualizations\n* Method does not compromise the 3D context provided by OCT data",

The most critical factor in identifying ROP that requires treatment is the presence of plus disease, which is associated with venous dilatation and arteriolar tortuosity in retinal vessels. Unfortunately, plus disease is challenging to diagnose using existing methods (i.e., manual exams with visible light and indirect ophthalmoscopes), thus leading to poor outcomes for preterm infants with severe forms of ROP. In addition, shining visible light into the eyes of infants can induce physiologic stress and ultimately lead to poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Packed microgel particles form granular scaffolds, which have been used for therapeutic applications in wound healing in part because of the micro-porosity that is formed between particles. This interconnected void space allows for unhindered cell infiltration and migration throughout the scaffold. Many studies have demonstrated that local geometry influences cell behavior, and in granular scaffolds, residing cells sense the microarchitecture of the void space.

    "ip_description": "Typically, microsurgical systems have a console for controlling surgical parameters or visualizing imaging data. In ophthalmic surgeries, the consoles can be used to display Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data, which enables great improvements in imaging but which the surgeon cannot see without looking away from the microscope. To address this, a heads-up display (HUD) was designed to allow the surgeon to visualize OCT images and microscope images simultaneously. Until now, the HUD only provided 2D data, greatly limiting a surgeon\u2019s depth perception during surgery. Duke\u2019s new stereoscopic HUD allows for volumetric imaging of OCT data. In this novel HUD, the 3D data of OCT images is provided real-time with intraoperative feedback to guide surgeries.\n\nDuke\u2019s stereoscopic HUD is a compact design that displays stereoscopic images utilizing a single organic light-emitting diode (OLED) or similar micro display for Microscope Integrated OCT (MIOCT) in ophthalmic microsurgeries. Two beam splitters are rotated relative to each other in order to direct different halves of the micro display to different oculars in the HUD. Then, when the HUD shows corresponding images for the two oculars, the users brain is able to fuse the images together to create stereoscopic images. This enables real-time volumetric OCT imaging. The overall direction of view is rotatable by a commercial foot joystick by surgeon while operating in real time. Further, the HUD allows for incorporating with Swept-Source MIOCT (SS-MIOCT), thereby enabling real-time volumetric imaging of 3D images during surgical maneuvers. The presented invention may be also be adapted to be integrated with head mounted display or with other microscopes to display stereoscopic volumetric images of many other types of samples. To date, at least five ophthalmic surgeons have used the HUD during simulated surgeries or human vitreorential surgeries and reported the ability to see prominent stereoscopic effect when looking in both oculars.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Displays volumetric (i.e., 3D) data during ophthalmic surgery\n* Allows for real-time processing\n* Control of positioning is simple and easy",

However, due to the difficulties in guiding laser surgical instruments, these tools may fail to destroy all targeted tissue while at the same time causing unintended damage to nearby healthy regions. There is a need for technology that can more precisely guide the path of these laser surgical tools so that they destroy all targeting tissue while preserving as much healthy tissue as possible. Duke inventors have developed a data-driven algorithm for optimizing the targeting and guiding of laser surgery tools. This is intended to work with existing laser surgery systems to help surgeons simulate the surgery method before tissue resection. Specifically, the software includes both a calibration component for building a 3D model of the tissue being cut, as well as a planning component that computes the optimal orientation and boundary for the laser scalpel to minimize damage to healthy tissue. The system relies on stereovision, in which a 3D representation of the tissue is formed from a pair of cameras aimed at different angles. First, the calibration process uses 3D-to-3D least squares optimization with random sample consensus to find a feasible 3D region. This method minimizes any calibration errors and increases the precision of the stereovision calibration. Then, the system uses this model to identify a 3D boundary between healthy and target tissue and optimizes the laser orientation to minimize collisions with that boundary. This has been demonstrated in a series of simulation experiments confirming the robustness of the algorithms. Stereovision calibration and path planning have applications in numerous other technologies, particularly in robotics. Advantages include increased precision making more surgeries feasible, such as removing difficult brain tumors, guidance component reducing tracking error compared to traditional stereovision systems, and targeting component removing subjectivity from surgical incision planning.",

Through agonist binding to GPCRs, beta-arrestins are able to invoke a host of cellular responses to hormones, agonist stimuli to promote specific responses. There is a need in research for a useful tool to promote beta-arrestin recruitment to GPCRs artificially in order to fully study the wide range of effects the molecule has on cellular functions in various settings. Duke inventors have developed a small molecule that is a SUMOylated form of beta-arrestin2. This molecule promotes the formation of high affinity GPCR- beta-arrestin2 and Ran GAP1- beta-arrestin2 complexes. This is intended to be a research tool in the field of GPCR research. Specifically, downstream outcomes of SUMOylated beta-arrestin2 -dependent signaling pathways, including, beta-arrestin recruiting ligands and biased agonists of GPCRs, will lead to enhanced knowledge in the field. SUMOylation provides a new molecular mechanism to direct beta-arrestin to specific sub-cellular compartments and interact with cellular proteins. SUMOYlation has distinct biological consequences that make it the ideal choice for studying this protein-protein interaction _in vitro_. This has been demonstrated _in vitro_ using various cell lines and fluorescent tags to confirm the localization of SUMOylated beta-arrestin2 and its increased efficacy over ubiquitinated beta-arrestin2.

This is intended to be used for the treatment of metabolic disease, especially type 2 diabetes. Specifically, fusion proteins comprising an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) domain as a linker, with a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist domain and a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) receptor agonist domain attached to the two ends of the ELP domain, can achieve robust glycemic control without a significant elevation in insulin. This has been demonstrated through _in vivo_ mice studies, which showed that the dual agonist drug had potent and sustained effects on body weights and ambient blood glucose levels, outperforming the single agonist monotherapies (GLP1-ELP and ELP-FGF21). By linking two agonists into one molecule, ELP also helps increase the circulating half-life and enables sustained release of the drugs. A single injection was shown to sufficiently maintain therapeutic drug levels and protect mice from hyperglycemia and weight gain for >7 days, reducing the frequency of required administration to once weekly. This technology could also be adapted to include other multiagonist drugs that allow for a broader range of metabolic applications, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and gestational diabetes.

While lifesaving, LVAD therapy is also associated with high morbidity, in part due to difficulties identifying an LVAD complication before an adverse event occurs. Current monitoring for LVAD complications in users requires frequent clinical assessments at specialized LVAD centers. There is a need for real-time and remote monitoring of LVAD users for early detection of complications. Additionally, acoustic biomarkers, while they have the potential to improve quality of life following LVAD implementation, their data quality is limited by background noise.\n\nDuke inventors have developed an adaptive filter with noise cancellation architecture in order to enhance underlying sounds of interest in digital sound recordings. This is intended to be used to facilitate the analysis of underlying diagnostically relevant sounds in LVAD recipients. Specifically, the inventors have achieved adaptive filtering with or without a noise reference signal, and the filter and/or noise reference parameters are able to be specified _a priori_ or self-tuned. Application of this filtering technique allows the inventors to mitigate LVAD sounds and identify low-frequency sounds that are high correlated with intrinsic heart sounds. This has been demonstrated _in vivo_ with data obtained from LVAD-supported individuals.

Current approaches for selecting waveform parameters are crude for KHF devices. The devices generally use a fixed waveform and frequency, and the other parameters are set either by the physician or a company representative during a short appointment. The amplitude is generally simply set as high as possible without patient discomfort. Therefore, there is a clear need to optimize the performance of electrical signals for production of block of neural activity.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a method for optimizing neuromodulatory therapies and reducing unwanted side effects. This is intended to improve neural device treatments for various diseases associated with pathological neural activity. Specifically, this is a method to identify an optimized waveform shape for blocking neural conduction. The optimized waveforms are identified through use of a global optimization algorithm based on predetermined performance criteria. A plurality of waveforms is generated and evaluated for neuronal conduction block using a computational model of extracellular neuronal stimulation, and a candidate waveform having an optimized shape capable of blocking neural conduction is identified. This technology has been demonstrated in lab simulations.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Enables the blocking of unwanted neural activity while reducing unwanted side effects\n- Can improve neuromodulatory therapies to treat chronic pain, phantom limb pain, and other applications\n- Reduces the energy demands to achieve conduction block substantially",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Cardiac ultrasound is a fast, inexpensive, and non-invasive method for visualizing the structure and function of the heart and for diagnosing cardiovascular conditions such as a heart murmur or heart attack. There are over 31 million cardiac ultrasounds performed in the United States every year. As the heart pumps blood, there are smaller contractions that occur in different regions of the heart wall. Analyzing these regional contractions of the heart is crucial for the diagnosis and monitoring of coronary artery disease (18 million patients in the US) and cardiac arrhythmias (12 million patients in the US). However, ultrasound imaging of these propagating waves of contractions along the walls of the heart is difficult and subjective. Specifically, the movement of the heart as it pumps blood can make it difficult to detect these smaller contractions. Therefore, there is a need for an easily interpretable and objective method of visualizing small, propagating contractions in the wall of the heart while it is in motion.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a new method of analyzing high frame rate cardiac ultrasounds to track and measure small movements in the wall of the heart while it is in motion. This method is capable of measuring the amplitude of motion, contractions, and relaxations of the heart muscle throughout the stages of the cardiac cycle. This is aided by a time reference provided by a simultaneous electrocardiogram recording, which measures the electrical activity of the heart. Specifically, the user is able to detect these small motions and see which regions of the tissue are moving at a high speed, a low speed, or are staying stationary using the difference in brightness of various regions between frames of the ultrasound video. This unique method produces extremely high timescale-resolution measurements of movements in the heart, which aids the diagnosis and monitoring of various cardiac conditions.\n\nThis method can also be used for measuring the stiffness of the walls of the heart, which has various applications in monitoring heart health, such as detecting cardiac fibrosis.\n\nAdvantages:\n* High time and spatial resolution (300 images per second) of small contractions and relaxations in the cardiac muscle, which helps the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and cardiac arrythmias.\n* Ultrasound imaging of the heart is safer and faster than MRI and CT imaging.\n* Improved sensitivity of a low-cost, non-invasive cardiac imaging method.",

    "ip_description": "Gap junctions are transmembrane channels that facilitate for cell-cell communication. They play a crucial role in normal cellular physiology and their dysfunction or misregulation is associated with many human diseases. Gap junctions are made up of proteins within the 21- member connexin (Cx) family. Various Cx isoforms and mutations are thus associated with disease and research tools are required to understand how Cx isoforms regulate gap junction compatibility, docking and permeability. Existing fast and accessible methods depend on permeability of gap junctions to small molecule dyes however few dyes are gap junction permeant and these dyes are typically connexin isoform specific. The current gold standard method, dual-patch clamp electrophysiological measurement, is low-throughput, expensive and requires high technical skill. The global market for reagents and tools for cell-based assays was valued at $21.3 billion in 2018 and is growing at a CAGR of 12.9%, expected to reach $39 billion in 2023. Thus, there is a need for a high-throughput, broadly applicable screening method to address the impact of disease-relevant Cx protein mutations and isoforms on gap junction formation and function.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a flow cytometry-based technique for the evaluation of cellular gap junctions. This is intended to be used as a research tool for the study of how different connexin isoforms and mutations affect function of gap junctions and contribute to human disease progression. Specifically, this method entitled FETCH (flow cytometry enabled tracking of connexosomes in HEK cells), is a two-component system consisting of the fluorescent reporters and HEK cell lines for flow cytometry and a software code used for analysis of data. In the execution of the method, the HEK 293FT cell lines are transiently transfected with fluorescently labeled, C-terminally fused connexin constructs. Following co-culture of cell lines with two different fluorescent markers, flow cytometry generates fluorescence profiles of the individual cells allowing for quantitative analysis of fluorescence exchange between cells mediated by the formation and turnover (internalization) of gap junctions. The accompanying software code generates a FETCH score that can be used as a standard metric to evaluate gap junction function. This has been demonstrated in the HEK 293FT cellular background _in vitro_ with multiple different connexin isoforms and disease relevant connexin mutant proteins.\n\nIn addition to the characterization and understanding of major aspects of Cx isoforms and mutants in physiology and disease, this method can bed used to engineer desirable docking properties into Cxs and generate completely novel gap junctions.\n\nAdvantages:\n* High-throughput system allowing for potential analysis of 96 samples at a time using a flow cytometry plate reader system\n* Broadly applicable to all connexin isoforms and mutations\n* Easy to perform, does not require high technical skill\n* Can be performed using any flow cytometer",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Duke inventors have developed a sensor for detecting humans in a room or building. This is intended to be used to detect intruders in secure environments (homes, data centers, etc.). Specifically, this technology utilizes one or several dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) as transmitters and/or receivers to probe the electromagnetic waveforms that are scattered directly and indirectly off a human inside of the room or building. DMAs consist of a waveguide or cavity with subwavelength metamaterial elements patterned into the structure. A radio frequency (RF) source injects a signal into the waveguide or cavity and the signal is leaked out by the metamaterial elements. The statistical variation in the scattering events detected by the receiver as a person enters or moves within a room is used to detect their presence. Importantly, by incorporating switchable components into the metamaterial elements and tuning them independently, DMA patterns can be altered with the electronic circuitry without the need for complex or expensive hardware. This sensor has been demonstrated to operate at millimeter wave frequency range and eliminates the need for direct line-of-site paths, meaning that all locations in a space can be probed (i.e. through solid objects such as thin walls or furniture). There is currently a working model of this sensor that has been tested extensively in staged cluttered rooms. Planned future steps for this project will focus on testing variations in placement/orientation of the transmitter and receiver and analysis method development, including advanced signal processing techniques and/or machine learning algorithms. This technology could also be used as an occupancy sensor in common residential buildings to control temperature settings, which could reduce energy waste of residential buildings. It could also be used for monitoring vital signs of life in elderly patients or infants without intrusive hardware, like cameras. Advantages include: Utilizes simple, low-cost semiconductor and RF components; Sensor can scan entire space, including through non-metallic objects (furniture, walls); i.e. no direct line-of-sight requirement; Sensor is physically small; Sensor has a large operating range and fast acquisition rate with high sensitivity; Low concern over interference with other devices; No harmful effects to humans or animals.",

This is intended to be an automated video analysis software that uses machine learning to measure the synchronization of multiple facial features as two people communicate. It has potential applications in the clinic, helping diagnose and treat mental disorders, as well as helping train humans, or robots, in empathy and trustworthiness. Specifically, the algorithm can use conventional or customized software to extract facial action units from a prescribed feature set and weigh each unit to determine the most relevant types of synchronies. Facial action units can be trained on relevant data sets for traits such as likeability, negotiation, and leadership. The algorithm uses a dynamic time warping procedure that allows for time lags and dynamic relationships between signals, instead of using conventional synchrony metrics. This has been demonstrated by predicting, significantly better than chance, if two people will trust each other in a Trust Game, after first analyzing video of them interacting freely.\n\nOther Applications:\n- Monitor therapy sessions to give therapists feedback on their facial responses to increase patient trust, leading to better mental health outcomes.\n- Monitor telehealth appointments to give clinicians feedback that optimizes their approach and attitude towards patients, dramatically improving health outcomes, treatment adherence, and pain levels.\n- Help train customer service representatives, or executives, to show empathy and likeability.\n- Create social robots with the ability to teach humans.\n- Create virtual reality and augmented reality characters capable of emotionally connecting with humans.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Completely automated\n- Simultaneously analyzes multiple types of behavior synchronization\n- Can be trained to evaluate combinations of personality traits\n- Algorithm uses a novel measure of synchrony that predicts social behavior better than any previously proposed synchrony metric",

Both membrane-bound and soluble forms of TRAIL can trigger apoptosis of target cells through interaction with TRAIL receptors. TRAIL Receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) is expressed in many human cancers and is exploited in cancer therapy for its ability to trigger caspase-related cell death upon receptor engagement. Several therapies based on purified TRAIL or TRAIL-R agonists have been unsuccessful due to the extremely short half-life (~30 minutes) of TRAIL, inadequate delivery to cancer cells, and weak agonist activity. Thus, there is a need for novel molecules that can bind to TRAIL receptors with improved pharmacokinetic activities and methods for using such molecules in the therapeutic treatment of a wide variety of cancers.\n\nDuke inventors have developed an anti-cancer therapeutic for tumors that express TRAIL-R2. This is intended to be used as an intratumoral injection for solid tumors before advanced metastatic disease, or in combination with other therapies for advanced metastatic disease.

Common skin disorders, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, affect close to 20% of the population. Skin lesions associated with bone marrow transplants and precancerous skin conditions affect fewer people but are still detrimental. There are many products on the market available to treat the symptoms of these conditions, such as itchiness or dryness. The most common treatments involve the use of topical steroids, which reduce the inflammatory response. However, use of steroids comes with steep side effects including skin damage (redness, bruising, and thinning) and can be absorbed and affect internal organs. Because of this, steroids may only be used for a limited time. Other treatments (such as salicylic acid, vitamin D, retinoids, calcineurin inhibitors and antihistamines) are less effective, and all come with side effects ranging from mild discomfort (skin irritation) to more serious conditions (risk of cancer and birth defects). There is a need for novel treatment for various inflammatory skin conditions which are complex to treat, and current products attempt to alleviate symptoms, but do not always address the underlying cause.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a novel therapeutic for inflammatory skin conditions. The MEK signaling pathway is abnormally activated in inflammatory skin diseases and cancers, but currently MEK inhibitors have not yet been used to treat non-cancerous conditions.

Unfortunately, many different strains, ages, and sexes of mice are used for research, each with nuanced variation in brain structure. The Allen Brain Atlas used as a reference is an adult male C57BL6 mouse. There is a need for MRI reference atlases that cover the diversity of mouse models used for research, so that light sheet microscopy can be accurately applied regardless of the of the mouse strain, age or gender studied.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a technique for obtaining mouse brain MR images that provide an accurate anatomic reference for light sheet microscopy images in the same specimen. This is intended to enable researchers to accurately correct for distortion in light sheet images of the mouse model being studied by referencing those images to labeled MRI images from the same mouse rather than to an arbitrary reference model that may be a different strain, age, and/or sex from the specimen studied. Specifically, before the light sheet images are collected, MR images are obtained from the animal.

As a result, researchers receive accurately labeled light sheet volumes that have been corrected for distortion using the same specimen. This has been demonstrated through the development of coherent atlases across more than 20 different mouse brains.\n\nThe underlying datasets could also be used with future imaging modalities that require a live tissue reference and is not restricted for use with light sheet microscopy.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Enables accurate light sheet microscopy reference for strains besides C57BL6\n* Mapping algorithm requires no manual label alignment\n* Some strains already in dataset and require no additional MRI imaging",

There is a need for more efficient and effective cooling fabric technologies to not only provide comfort to the wearer but prevent potentially dangerous side effects from overheating.\n\nDuke inventors have developed an advanced adaptive cooling fabric technology. This is intended to be used in a variety of consumer products ranging from athletic apparel to workwear. Specifically, this fabric utilizes an adaptive vent technology, where vents within the fabric open under heat and sweat conditions to improve cooling effects and close in the absence of those conditions to retain heat. This is done utilizing a composite material comprising nylon and silver: when the composite material experiences an increase in heat the silver expands and the nylon contracts forcing vents in the fabric to open, allowing for a completely passive system of cooling.

    "ip_description": "Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) and inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) are associated with high 5-year mortality rates (respectively 55% and 33%), especially when compared to early-stage breast cancers (~80%). LABC and IBC are treated with neoadjuvant therapy prior to physical tumor removal. This treatment is an invasive procedure with variable success. Patients respond variably to neoadjuvant treatment which can affect the overall success of treatment. Complications can occur based on whether the tumor is aggressive or indolent. The global market for breast cancer is expected to grow 5.5% by 2026, and approximately 10% of all breast cancer diagnoses are classified as LABC. There is a need for identification of biomarkers that can predict LABC and IBC treatment response.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a method of predicting LABC and IBC treatment response. This is intended to be used by healthcare providers to inform treatment regimens and predict patient survival. Specifically, the invention consists of a biomarker kit containing a probe that identifies the desired genetic biomarker and quantifies the amount present in a biological sample (i.e., SULT1A1, SULT1A2, PARP6, MTA1, ARPC5L, HYOU1, AVEN, CHST11, TLN2, CHST3, PRKCA, COL4A4, and TNC). Biomarkers were identified by comparing tumor patterns and mRNA expression. Patients with biopsies prior to treatment were used to predict response to neoadjuvant therapy. One such biomarker identifies CF tumors which are predicted to respond favorably to treatment and are also implicated in more aggressive cancer progression. Using this method, healthcare providers can predict patient survival and cancer aggressiveness. This has been demonstrated through Kaplan-Meier and Cox hazard regression analysis on data gathered from a clinical trial.\n\nThis technology could also be used in additional cancers that utilize neoadjuvant therapy prior to tumor extraction. By applying the same functional imaging and gene expression pairing of the invention to identify therapeutic biomarkers, additional kits could be made with these novel biomarkers to inform treatment response and patient survival in these additional diseases.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Technology can predict response to treatment prior to therapy\n* Using technology can inform cancer aggressiveness compared to current predictive methods\n* Low-cost pretreatment procedure\n* Specific test with minimal competitors",

    "ip_description": "Non-small-cell lung cancer accounts for 82% of all lung cancer diagnoses. Immune checkpoint blockade treatment is an exciting new course of action among advanced stage non-small-cell lung cancer patients. However, only a minority of patients respond to immune checkpoint blockade treatment \u2013 in the U.S., the estimate percentage of patients with cancer, in general, eligible for checkpoint inhibitor drugs in 2018 was 43.63%, but less than 1% responded to the drugs. Currently, a predictor of tumor response to blockade treatment is microsatellite instability. Patients with microsatellite instability tumors were associated with better responses to blockade treatment. The field has recently discovered that a high tumor mutational burden is an even better predictor of blockade treatment response. However, given ambiguities, the suitability of tumor mutational burden for selecting patients requires additional clinical evidence. There exists an urgent need for clear identification of tumor mutations that will respond favorably to immune checkpoint blockade therapy due to the treatments' high cost and severe side effects.\n\nDuke inventors and colleagues have developed a new genomic-based method to identify a subpopulation of non-small-cell lung cancer patients that will benefit from immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The team elucidated a mutational signature, whereby if two or more of 52 candidate genes were mutated, there would be significant immune checkpoint blockade treatment benefits in non-small-cell lung cancer patients. This ultimately defined a tumor microenvironment that is primed for responding to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The compound mutation signature ensures that both a reasonably high tumor mutational burden and functionally relevant mutations are considered when selecting non-small-cell lung cancer patients for immune checkpoint blockade treatment.\n\nThe new genomics-based method can also be applied to other late-stage cancer treatment methods like radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy, as well as other cancer populations, such melanoma, bladder and colorectal patients, with further testing and discovery.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Predicts immune checkpoint blockade therapy response better than that of tumor mutational burden, capturing over 20% of patients among the four cancer types tested\n* Easier patient sample collection than PD-L1 expression in non-small-cell lung cancer\n* Mutations are associated with better immunotherapy outcome than tumor mutational burden status\n* The method is generalized and can be applied to other cancer types with further validation",

Rather than utilizing diffuse white light to evenly illuminate a sample, the microscope uses a bowl-shaped light source comprised of LEDs. This allows for illumination at different angles up to nearly 90 degrees with different colors, essentially casting shadows and highlighting different features on the sample depending on the pattern of LEDs used. Using a convolutional neural network, the device is able to learn which features are most important for detecting a particular pathogen and which illumination pattern works best for highlighting those features. In an initial demonstration, the inventors were able to use their microscope to automatically identify malaria-infected cells with greater accuracy than either trained physicians or other machine learning approaches.

    "ip_description": "Duke inventors have developed a method to increase the efficacy of current anti-cancer therapies. This is intended to be used to sensitize tumors to radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, so as to decrease local recurrence and/or increase chemotherapeutic efficacy. Specifically, radiation and chemotherapy can upregulate the level and activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) through nitric oxide (NO) mediated S-nitrosylation, leading to increased tumor angiogenesis and drug resistance. Thus, using agents that inhibit the expression, activation, or nitrosylation of HIF-1 in tumor cells can enhance treatment efficacy. These agents include nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors, NO scavengers, and HIF-1 nitrosylation inhibitors. This has been demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo models of breast, melanoma, adenocarcinoma and colon cancer. The results collectively show that radiation increases the number of tumor-associated macrophages, producing NO through inducible NOS and resulting in HIF-1 stabilization in the irradiated tumor. A general NOS inhibitor, N\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), was administered in mice models with two different aggressive tumors, murine mammary adenocarcinoma and murine melanoma. Both showed that the inhibition of NO production by L-NAME significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy and reduced tumor vasculature. This technology could also be used to treat inflammatory responses through inhibition of HIF-1 nitrosylation and stabilization, inspiring the development of new drugs to treat inflammatory diseases. Advantages include significantly enhancing, at least two-fold, the efficacy of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy for cancer treatments, a novel target of regulation mechanism of HIF-1 through NO-mediated S-nitrosylation, demonstrated to be effective and safe in various types of mouse tumor models, and could be a treatment strategy for inflammatory diseases.",

    "ip_description": "For patients suffering from chronic pain associated with degenerative changes, inflammation, neuropathy or cancer, the ability to carry out daily life and work activities is a challenge. Current treatment methods are limited and associated with high-risk surgical procedures. Pharmaceuticals and opioids can lead to central nervous system side-effects, limited efficacy, and addiction, whereas spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) stimulation are costly open surgical procedures associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. A promising minimally invasive and effective alternative is the delivery of stem cells, steroids, nerve blocks, anti-inflammatory agents, growth factors, or gene-therapy agents directly to nerve roots exiting the spinal column near the pain source. However, these nerve-roots are hard to effectively reach with straight needles even with image-guided placement, impeding the effective delivery of treatments. There is a need for more flexible needles to deliver treatments to difficult-to-reach nerve-roots via minimally invasive techniques.\n\nDuke inventors have designed a flexible needle device to deliver chronic pain therapies to difficult-to-reach targets within the spine. Specifically, the device consists of a 21-gauge introducer needle that houses a 25-gauge, pre-curved nitinol cannula that is deployed via a sliding mechanism on a handheld hub. Taking advantage of the shape memory characteristics of nitinol, the distal end of the cannula can be heat-set to a specific curvature. Therapeutics can be then introduced through a Luer connection at the proximal end of the device.

These conditions encompass a broad range of tissue types, each with their own sonic properties. Successful diagnosis and assessment are most likely to occur when clinicians can clearly see the boundaries between different tissue regions, but this is not always possible with current ultrasound technology. In particular, some tissues have inherently low contrast, and other tissues are known to produce noisy ultrasound signals, both of which impede the ability of clinicians to make successful assessments of the resulting images. There is a need for technology which can improve the contrast of ultrasound images for low contrast and noise producing tissues.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a quantitative filter that transforms ultrasound measurements to increase contrast. The filter is intended to be applied to raw ultrasound signals, removing noise and increasing contrast where needed, resulting in a new processed ultrasound signal that is easier for clinicians to visualize. Specifically, the filter applies the Van-Cittert Zernike theorem to compute the element-to-element correlations across time and space, which can discriminate between true signals and those which are likely to be noise. Then, the signal variance can be used to amplify low contrast regions, since this value is known to have an inverse relationship with the signal-to-noise ratio. As a result, noise is eliminated and contrast is amplified, increasing the ability of clinicians to discriminate between different structures in the resulting images. This has been demonstrated in experiments comparing the contrast in images from traditional B-mode ultrasonic images with those obtained after applying the Van-Cittert Zernike filter. These experiments have involved simulation, phantom, and _in vivo_ human data.\n\nThis technology could also be applied to other signal processing tasks in which the signal provides both temporal and spatial information and where contrast and noise are typically major confounds.

NLRP3 also plays a central role in diabetic complications and is a crucial element in the development of diabetic bladder dysfunction.

    "ip_description": "With the surge of minimally invasive surgeries comes the demand of improved imaging techniques to assist in obtaining successful outcomes. Intravascular (catheter-based) ultrasound has emerged as a leading imaging technology for minimally invasive procedures. Globally, there are over 180 million ultrasound-procedures performed annually. Currently, most ultrasound imaging technology is limited by the transducer arrays bandwidth within the physical dimensions of the probe. As the desired frequency increases, the thickness of the vibrator element must be reduced. Below a certain thickness and surface area, the conventional process destroys the vibrator elements as they are being cut. Therefore, there is a need for improved ultrasound imaging arrays having smaller sizes and having ultrasound transmission and reception capability at higher frequencies, while reducing both the size and cost of the equipment.\n\nDuke inventors have developed an improved transducer array for ultrasonic imaging. This is intended to be used for catheter-based ultrasound imaging to assist in medical procedures. Specifically, the inventors have developed piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducers (pMUTs) that can be arranged into ultrasound arrays of specific sizes and geometries finely tuned to specific fundamental mode vibrations. The imaging array utility has been demonstrated with a catheter-based ultrasound probe obtaining real-time 3-D (4-D) _in vivo_ images of adult porcine hearts.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Reduction in size of array elements\n* Increase sensitivity of array elements\n* Reduce cross coupling among array elements\n* Extended bandwidth of array elements\n* Reduce cost of array production\n* Reduces lower frequency rumble",

    "ip_description": "Night vision and thermal imaging are key technologies used by the military, security and rescue services around the world in combat operations, intelligence, surveillance and guidance systems. They are also widely employed in the industry enabling detection of hot spots in electrical or mechanical installations, and in building diagnosis to conduct energy audits, detect moisture in ceilings, walls, or roofs, and plumbing leaks or blockages. However, vacuum tube technology that night vision devices have been relying on for almost a century restricts the size and durability of devices. Using pyroelectric crystals as a sensing element in infrared radiation detectors has been shown to be an advantageous alternative. A pyroelectric crystal polarization changes with temperature generating an electrical signal that can be converted into an image. However, a major drawback of pyroelectric detectors is that as a crystal receives the signal it heats up, and continuous sensing leads to overheating and quick saturation. The use of a heat sink does not solve the issue as heat buildup is essential to the measurement process. Mechanical choppers traditionally used to circumvent the issue are not practical as they add bulk and moving parts to the devices. Therefore, there is a need for a novel design that would draw heat away from the sensor while keeping the device efficient, responsive, small and lightweight. A Duke University researcher has developed a novel solid-state heat throttle design that efficiently cools the pyroelectric sensor by allowing the controlled draw of heat out of the crystal. The new device utilizing this heat throttled meta-pyroelectric design will have the advantage of better sensitivity over traditional technology while being small, light, durable and cheap.

Thermal diodes that have been reported suffer from drawbacks such as low diodicities (typically <1.1), reduced rectification (<10), and challenges to design a system to ensure effective liquid return from the condenser to the evaporator. A vapor chamber is a planar version of the heat pipe, a device of very high thermal conductance which is widely used in military, industrial and commercial applications. State-of-the-art vapor chamber heat spreaders typically use porous wick structures with pore sizes of the order of 100 micron or less to induce capillarity-driven liquid return, but such wick structures have distinct and inherent disadvantages. For example, wick structures generally have very large thermal resistance, which inhibits efficient heat transfer. Another disadvantage of wicked vapor chambers is manufacturability, especially when incorporating wick structures on the side walls and integrating them with in-plane wick structures. Orientation dependence is also an issue for conventional vapor chambers because gravity can affect the return of liquid from the evaporator to the condenser. It is therefore advantageous is to have a wickless evaporator that does not need any porous wicking structure at all, and to have a liquid return mechanism that does not depend on the orientation of external forces.\n\nDuke researchers have developed a new type of vapor chamber intended to be used in military, industrial and commercial applications. A thermal diode comprising a superlyophobic surface, and a lyophilic surface separated from the superlyophobic surface defining a chamber.

Further, global incidence of OA is increasing due to rises in geriatric populations and other associated risk factors such as obesity. OA most commonly affects the joints in the knees, hands, feet, hips, and spine of individuals, which can lead to debilitating symptoms. Currently, demographics and baseline characteristics such as age, sex, body mass index, knee pain, general bone mineral content, and joint space width are poor predictors of OA progression. There is an urgent unmet need for improved methods for diagnosing and predicting progression of knee OA to better inform therapeutic or preventative interventions and to avoid false negative OA trials by enriching for individuals with high likelihood of experiencing OA progression during the 2-3 year course of a typical OA trial.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a method for detecting and predicting OA progression by analysis of a blood sample. This is intended to be used as a highly sensitive and specific tool to identify individuals who are experiencing OA progression or who are at risk of progression and may benefit from therapeutic interventions. This is accomplished by measuring a panel of biomarkers found in various bodily fluids that have been shown to be predictive of OA. Specifically, a collection of 15 serum proteomic markers can be measured using various existing analytical techniques to determine the likelihood of OA diagnosis and/or prognosis by inputting biomarker concentrations into the predictive model developed by the inventors.

Palliative care can be provided at any time during an illness with curative or supportive therapies, and it is often the last care the patient receives. In existing practice, the means of identifying patients with palliative care needs are highly inefficient. First, physicians may not refer patients who are likely to benefit from palliative care for multiple reasons such as over-optimism, time pressures, or treatment inertia. This may lead to patients failing to have their wishes carried out at end of life and overuse of aggressive care. Second, a shortage of palliative care professionals makes proactive identification of candidate patients via manual chart review an expensive and time-consuming process. Therefore, there is a need for a technology that would play a crucial role by efficiently identifying patients who may benefit most from palliative care but might otherwise be overlooked under current care models.\n\nDuke Connected Care (DCC) partnered with researchers at Duke Institute for Health Innovation to design a novel machine-learning predictive model that combines medical claims and clinical data to effectively target DCC\u2019s existing palliative care interventions among the Medicare Shared Savings Plan (MSSP) population.

    "ip_description": "Optical isolators are critically important in many applications in optical systems. Optical isolators are devices that transmit light in only one direction. They are used to avoid unwanted back-propagation of light, for example, to avoid destabilization of semiconductor lasers caused by reflected light coming back into the laser cavity. Conventional optical isolators are based on a Faraday rotator sandwiched between two polarizers. Because of the size of the Faraday rotator, this type of optical isolator is relatively large. It is also a challenge to build Faraday rotator-type isolator components in guided-optics format, i.e. to integrate them on a chip. In order to construct guided-wave optical isolators, an asymmetric Mach-Zehnder waveguide interferometer is commonly used. This optical isolator does not require polarizers, but instead uses high-precision interference for blocking back-propagating light involving two long waveguides hosting reciprocal and non-reciprocal phase shifters. Therefore there is a need for an improved single-waveguide optical polarizer design that is compatible with integrated nanoscale optical circuitry. Duke researchers have designed a novel optical isolator constructed on a single-mode waveguide that uses magneto-optic materials to create a non-homogenous waveguide cross-section. The scheme of rejecting reverse-propagating waves is based on a direction-dependent waveguide cut-off frequency. The resulting optical isolator is compact and exhibits high reverse isolation in the bandwidth between the lowest forward- and backward- cutoff frequencies of the waveguide. The configuration of the magneto-optical medium distribution can also be optimized to the desired mode profile. Please also see the related technology T-003887.

There are thousands of PPIs that are essential to understand the biological functionalities of cells. With the knowledge of where and when PPIs occur, the mechanisms of normal biological activity can be compared to those of diseased cells. However, identifying and monitoring PPIs can be challenging and is currently limited to detecting and observing two proteins interacting when many signaling cascades include multiple interactions. Furthermore, the available technology is mostly limited to studying PPIs in fixed, dead cells. There is a need for methods to study PPIs in living cells for real-time observation and to study more than two proteins interacting.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a method that allows for the detection of three protein interactions in living cells with the use of bioluminescent resonant energy transfer. The technology expands upon Promega Corporation\u2019s NanoBiT \u00ae, which detects two proteins. This method is intended to be used by biotechnology companies and academic laboratories studying protein interactions. Specifically, this technology adds to the NanoBiT \u00ae system, which tags two proteins of interest with a split luminescent protein that creates a luminescent signal when in close proximity. The luminescent signal from the two proteins acts as an energy donor for the additional component created by the Duke inventors. The additional component is a red-shifted acceptor protein that can be tagged to a third protein of interest. This has been demonstrated in living cells through a study looking at the interactions among the G protein, G\u03b1, beta-arrestin, and a third agonist component, vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R). With their technology, the inventors were able to observe that the V2R catalyzed the formation of G\u03b1i:beta-arrestin scaffolds.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Invention allows for the observation of 3 protein interactions\n* PPIs can be monitored _in vivo_\n* Proof of concept study highlights the potential of this technology to understand key biological processes\n* Integrates seamlessly into the industry standard Promega NanoBiT\u00ae system",

It\u2019s estimated that bioplastics production will grow by 80% between 2020 and 2026. Leading bioplastics like polylactic acid are playing a large role in this market shift, but their plastic material properties limit the applications to mostly packaging-based applications. There is a need for sustainably sourced, degradable polymers with a larger range of mechanical properties that can offer a replacement for a larger range of petroleum-based materials to supplement the current bioplastics market.\n\nInventors at Duke and the University of Birmingham have developed polymers created from sugar-based starting materials. These materials are intended to be a more sustainable alternative to petroleum-based polymers that can supplement current bioplastics to offer a wider range of material properties. Specifically, these are isohexide-based linear polymers with tunable properties that are controlled by the stereochemistry of the building blocks. The inventors have demonstrated with isohexide stereoisomers, isoidide and isomannide, that a family of degradable materials with excellent mechanical properties are accessible using these polymers. Isoidide-based polymers provide stiffness and malleability similar to common plastics and strength comparable to high grade engineering plastics like Nylon-6. Isomannide-based polymers also offered high elasticity that exceeds most cross-linked rubbers. The blending of these two stereoisomer sugars offers control of the elastomeric or plastic characteristic of the material as well as the degradation rate.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Sugar-derived polymers with a range of excellent mechanical properties that can exceed commercially available polymers and be tuned independently of each other\n* Can be tuned to degrade faster than petroleum-derived plastics and other common bioplastics if released into the environment\n* Suitable to be recycled in the same way that commercially available plastics are currently recycled",

It is marked by the person\u2019s hyperactivity, inability to keep focus and control impulsive behaviors. Despite the high prevalence of this disorder, standardized and validated approaches for diagnosing ADHD are lacking. Typical adult diagnosis relies on the collection of a large amount of clinical data from multiple sources (patient, observers, family members), along with considerable time on the part of the clinician to integrate and interpret this information. However, in primary care settings, where the large majority of ADHD diagnoses are made, providers do not have the time or resources to collect and analyze this volume of clinical information. This results in an increase of the misdiagnosis probability and subsequent suboptimal treatment for referred patients. Therefore, there is a critical need to help identify which pieces of clinical data contribute most meaningfully to a diagnosis of ADHD and develop methods for efficient diagnosis.\n\nDuke researchers use machine-learning algorithm to develop predictive models for ADHD diagnosis (and lack thereof) from an existing set of complex clinical data. This algorithm will predict ADHD diagnosis with maximum diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and predictive power for both positive and negative cases. In addition, it will allow to quantify the importance of various factors to the performance of the model, and to identify data that are essential for ADHD prediction status. This algorithm will therefore guide the efficient use of clinical tools, resulting in increased objectivity and reliability in adult ADHD diagnosis.

This results in an increased cost of approximately $9-16 billion/year to the U.S. healthcare system, with $115,000 additional cost per case. These numbers have increased exponentially owing to the prevalence of respiratory problems associated with COVID-19. Prone positioning is the least invasive evidence-based treatment for patients suffering from ARDS that demonstrates improvement in both 28-day and 90-day mortality. Evidence consequently suggests a decrease in the number of days patients undergoing this therapy spend on the ventilator and is thus strongly recommended by all major critical care societies.\n\nDespite this endorsement, barriers to implementing prone positioning are vast. Excess patient weight, nursing shortages, expense of current solutions and lack of awareness result in only 10-33% of candidates receiving this life saving therapy. The most common current practice in place is the manual approach. This requires anywhere from 5-7 staff members to achieve the therapy. This approach is inefficient, time-consuming, requires many resources and takes medical personnel away from other critically ill patients. Opposingly, more sophisticated options are associated with tedious troubleshooting, prohibitively expensive, intimidating, and require installation to be compatible with existing ICU facilities.\n\nA new Duke technology, called PositionAir, has been developed to address this need and to prompt prone positioning as a therapy. The device consists of two identical inflatable pads to be placed on the patient bed. The pads are connected to a pump box that would power on, allow air pressure to lift, turn and catch the patient to a 180 rotation.

Furthermore, proteins involved in the formation, removal, and recognition of m6A have emerged as critical regulators of a variety of physiological processes, ranging from stem cell proliferation to learning and memory. Thus, detecting m6A RNA methylation sites in cells is critical for our ability to understand how this modification impacts gene expression to contribute to cellular function and disease states. Currently available m6A site mapping and quantification techniques rely heavily on the immunoprecipitation of methylated RNAs using m6A-recognizing antibodies. However, this antibody-dependent approach has limitations including cross-reactivity of the anti-m6A antibodies, the requirement for large RNA input, time-consuming library preparation, and high cost. The current invention fulfills the need for a simple, sensitive, and highly specific antibody-free method for single-nucleotide resolution mapping and quantification of m6A in the transcriptome. Dr. Kathryn Meyer and colleagues have developed a strategy to detect RNA modifications, including m6A, that is amenable to in vivo, cellular and in vitro assays. Their method involves using the APOBEC1 cytidine deaminase domain to edit m6A-adjacent cytidines, which can be detected using RNA-seq, reverse transcription and Sanger Sequencing. This approach substantially improves the time and cost associated with global m6A detection and enables transcriptome-wide mapping of m6A in limited RNA samples, without the need for m6A antibodies.

Specifically, an _N_-hydroxyimide compound (ES1) enables a horseradish peroxidase-mediated radical initiating system to produce polymeric hydrogels and avoids the use of conventional beta-diketones that pose toxicity concerns. The inventors have demonstrated this process with a variety of monomers (e.g., DMAA, NVP, NIPAM, PEGMA, gelatin methacryloyl, and acryloylated proteins) and found that polymerization is successful at mild temperatures (room temperature to 37 \u00b0C) across a wide pH range (2.3 \u2013 7.5) with a relatively short induction period (as short as 1 min). Additionally, they have effectively incorporated inorganic and metallic nanoparticles (e.g., gold and silica nanoparticles) into polymer networks to produce functional nanocomposite hydrogels. Advantages include: Creates a hydrogel within minutes under mild conditions, Avoids the need for expensive equipment or toxic reagents associated with other free radical polymerization methods, Likely does not require the need to remove the initiator system from the hydrogel before applications, A versatile process that can be used to create hydrogels from a variety of monomers for applications in many industries, including biomedical, automotive, chemical, solid-state organic electronics, agriculture, forestry, and textile, Shows high monomer conversion (> 95%).",

The market for CT services is expected to grow from $91B in 2017 to $121B in 2024, with an estimated CAGR of 4.6%. However, as imaging technologies improve, the size and complexity of the data collected in scans also grows, making reconstruction of images with software an increasingly computationally intensive task. Theoretically powerful artificial intelligence approaches like deep learning suffer from increased graphics processing memory requirements, slowing their adoption. There is a need for more efficient deep learning systems for reconstructing CT images. Duke inventors have developed an efficient deep learning system for reconstructing CT images. To overcome the memory bottleneck of deep learning approaches, the technique greatly reduces the number of parameters necessary in the neural network layers. Specifically, geometrically restricting the reconstructed voxels associated with each pixel on the projection to only those which the original beamlet passed through allows one large fully connected neural net layer to be broken up into smaller fully connected layers. This allows the algorithm to focus on the most relevant connections between projection pixels and reconstruction voxels, greatly reducing the memory requirements. This technique has been validated against state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms with ground truth cone-beam CT (CBCT) data. Advantages include: Estimated 1/1000th the memory requirement as compared to other deep learning CBCT reconstruction approaches, works on 2D and 3D CT images, reconstruction time, quality, and accuracy comparable to other reconstruction approaches, system can be trained with a smaller training dataset than other deep learning reconstruction approaches, system does not need to be retrained for different numbers of projections or initial angles, postprocessing component effectively reduces image artifacts due to undersampling.",

    "ip_description": "Chronic pain is an escalating issue worldwide \u2013 in the U.S., an estimated one of five adults are affected. Chronic pain is difficult to treat, often requiring powerful opioids to provide relief. These oftentimes have moderate analgesic benefit and cause long-term unwanted effects including habituation, escalating drug use and outright addiction. Over 75,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses in the year ending April 2021, up from over 56,000 the year before. The compelling need to develop new safe and effective analgesic treatments, devoid of opioid liabilities, is rooted in the synergistic crises of chronic refractory pain epidemic plus opioid epidemic, both ongoing and with ongoing synergy. Thus, there exists an urgent need for new ways of treating chronic pain that do not have side effects such as addiction and sedation.\n\nDuke inventors and colleagues have developed new therapeutic approaches to chronic pain management that are effective and long-lasting, yet not addictive or sedative. The team elucidated an epigenetic mechanism that upregulates the expression of the _KCC2_ gene. The KCC2 transporter pumps chloride ions out of neurons. Enhancement of _KCC2_ gene expression normalizes the inhibitory effects of GABA, and repairs this function in the pain gate of the spinal cord where the primary defect in chronic pain is lack of expression of _KCC2_. The team demonstrated safe and effective treatment of chronic pain due to nerve injury and metastatic bone cancer in preclinical mouse models with two approaches: one by repurposing the cancer drug candidate kenpaullone, the other by delivering a delta-catenin transgene to the spinal cord through viral vector gene therapy. Both approaches were effective at enhancing gene expression of _KCC2_ in key pain relay nerve cells in the dorsal spinal cord, thus rendering GABA transmission more effective. Enhancing _KCC2_ expression was also effective against itch in a contact dermatitis preclinical model.\n\nThe _KCC2_ gene has been linked to other neurological pathologies, including spinal cord and brain injury, epilepsy, Rett syndrome, Huntington's disease, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and beyond. Enhancing _KCC2_ expression could be beneficial for diseases with impaired function of GABA caused by elevated neuronal chloride.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   No observed side effects such as addiction, sedation, motor impairment\n*   Onset of action is delayed by a few days, indicative of gene regulation renormalization, then pain relief has prolonged duration over weeks\n*   Novel targeted pathway and mechanism of action elucidated as involving delta-catenin and KAISO transcription factors\n*   Multiple therapeutic approaches demonstrated\n*   _KCC2_ gene expressed only in neurons, providing a promising target for gene therapy",

    "ip_description": "Many neurological disorders, including pain and spasticity, are characterized by undesirable increases in sensory, motor, or autonomic nerve activity. Local application of kilohertz frequency alternating currents (KHFAC) can effectively and completely block the conduction of undesired hyperactivity through peripheral nerves and could be a therapeutic approach for alleviating disease symptoms. However, KHFAC nerve block produces an undesirable initial burst of action potentials (APs) prior to achieving block, known as onset response. This onset firing may result in muscle contraction and pain and is a significant impediment to potential applications of KHFAC nerve block. There are some existing approaches to reduce or eliminate the onset response, such as electrode geometry design and amplitude and frequency modulation of the applied signal. However, these approaches are often unable to completely eliminate onset firing and can be challenging for clinical implementation. Hence, there is an ongoing need for improved methods of KHFAC treatment.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a method of pain-free blocking of neural activity intended to improve the clinical utility of KHFAC-based devices. Specifically, this is a novel engineering optimization approach to design blocking waveforms that eliminates the onset response by moving voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs) to closed-state inactivation (CSI) without first opening. The inventors used computational models and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to design a charge-balanced 10 kHz biphasic current waveform that produced conduction block without onset firing in peripheral axons at specific locations and with specific diameters.

Rigorous quality control (QC) programs are essential to maintain high-performance levels of CT scanners. An integral component of any QC protocol is the imaging of a phantom (a specifically designed physical test object) to identify artifacts that come from the imaging device. While QC phantoms for single-energy CT are well developed, there is currently no standard phantom or analysis methodology for establishing a multi-energy CT QC program. Therefore, a multi-energy CT phantom providing the rigor needed to ensure optimal system performance is of critical need.\n\nDuke researchers have developed an imaging phantom suitable for QC scans on a multi-energy capable CT scanner. The phantom is an add-on module to the standard American College of Radiology image quality phantom. It is primarily composed of a water-equivalent plastic and contains cylindrical inserts representing iodine, calcium, blood, adipose tissue and more. The phantom will be used to collect QC scans using the multi-energy mode of CT scanners to verify the quantitative accuracy of multi-energy scans and to ensure the efficacy of clinical protocols for multi-energy analysis. The design is simple, and it allows for the automated analysis to streamline the QC process.\n\n**Advantages**\n\n*   Provides a standard phantom to establish rigorous quality control of multi-energy CT scanners\n*   Design is a simple add-on to existing single-energy CT phantoms\n*   Allows for the automated analysis to streamline the QC process",

A common feature in late onset AD patients is the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. These plaques are clusters of amyloid precursor protein fragments that form in neurons. Despite years of research, the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the formation of amyloid plaques remain unknown and multiple hypotheses for their origin have been proposed. A common thread in AD research is the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in the formation of amyloid plaques. Thus, there is clear need to develop therapeutic strategies based on mitochondrial mechanisms associated with AD.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a method for treating neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Specifically, they have found that the modification of the human TOMM40 intron 6 Alu complex using epigenetic drug targeting and/or CRISPR modification as a therapeutic approach would serve to stabilize the TOMM40 mRNA by preventing alternative splicing events caused by the Alu complex itself and/or newly inserted Alu elements.

    "ip_description": "When a retinal condition is suspected in a patient, optical coherence tomography (OCT) is used to obtain detailed images of the retina. Due to the large amount of data needed to be processed during image acquisition, several seconds are needed to collect sufficient data. During this time patient needs to fix their gaze so that the OCT system is centered on fovea (most sensitive and critical retinal region). While looking in one direction and concentrating on one point for several seconds is usually not an issue for adults and older children, infants and active toddlers would not cooperate. In that case the choices usually are to place a child under general anesthesia (which involves many risks), perform a limited examination or wait until the child grows older and is able to cooperate. For that reason, some treatable retinal conditions in young children are frequently missed, which creates a need for a technology allowing detecting and tracking eye fixation and synchronizing it with OCT system focus.\n\nDuke researchers present a novel system that combines OCT imaging with a retinal birefringence scanning (RBS). During RBS, a spot of near infrared polarized light is scanned in a circle on the retina. Foveal fixation (when the patient is looking at the center of the scanned circle) is determined from the polarization signature or the light reflected back. RBS allows fast, direct and reliable eye-focus detection that has been demonstrated in adults and has been used for diagnosing strabismus in young children. In the Duke\u2019s design, the RBS-subsystem detects and signals the presence of foveal fixation to the OCT subsystem, thus triggering data collection. Throughout the examination, the unsuspecting child is viewing a cartoon on a small LCD computer screen, which specific attention/fixation locking targets appearing periodically in the center of the screen while the main movie fades away. The examiner is thus able to retain optical alignment of the OCT device with the child\u2019s eye.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Allows diagnosis of retinal diseases in young or patients and in other patients who cannot cooperate with traditional OCT exams\n* Allows monitoring of the progression or response to ocular therapy without a need for sedation or anesthesia\n* Clinically suitable",

Recently, with the commercial availability of semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNT), the advent of \u201clab-on-a-chip\u201d printed electronics has fostered the development of low-cost sensors that can be rapidly fabricated. Specifically, printed CNT thin-film transistors have shown high performance. However, a major challenge to developing CNT-based biosensing devices is that electronic circuits are designed to function in a dry state, while most biological measurements occur in complex wet environments such as blood, serum, urine, and saliva. This created the need to incorporate \u201cbio-interfacial\u201d materials that permit operation of electronic circuitry within a physiological medium. A bio-interfacial material must not only be able to immobilize bio-recognition elements (such as enzymes, antibodies, oligonucleotides) that target analytes of interest, but also prevent denaturation of these reagents to preserve their biomolecular interactions and thus the fidelity of the signal produced by the device. Another complicating factor is that the performance of the device can be impaired by nonspecific binding (NSB) events occurring when the sensor is exposed to a biological sample. NSB can result in false-positive signals and lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Thus, there is a critical need for improved CNT-based biosensors that exhibit \u201cnon-fouling\u201d (protein- and cell-resistant) properties while maintaining high SNRs and preserving specific target binding.\n\nDuke researchers have developed novel non-fouling biosensors that can accurately and sensitively detect analytes in biological samples. The sensors are layered structures that include a printed carbon nanotube (CNT) thin-filmed transistor and a non-fouling polymer bio-interface layer, with a high-permissivity dielectric in between. The presence (or absence) of an analyte is detected through binding interactions between the analyte and capture agents printed onto the polymer layer, which result in a change of an electrical property of the CNT transistor. The polymer layer is made of poly-oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (POEGMA) in form of a brush-like structure printed on the dielectric. POEGMA decreases non-specific binding and adsorption of non-target analytes to the sensor. It exhibits superior non-fouling properties, even in complex biological milieu such as whole blood and serum, which translates to the sensor\u2019s high signal-to-noise ratios. The fully functional biosensor has been experimentally verified and has been shown to detect 10 pg/ml of Leptin in serum with detection range of 105.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Accurate and sensitive detection of target analytes in wet biological samples\n* Reduced non-specific binding from biological samples\n* Antibodies stabilized on a POEGMA brush remain active for months without the need for hydrated conditions or refrigeration",

Computational E-field dosimetry has been identified by the National Institute of Mental Health as instrumental for determining brain regions stimulated by TMS and for developing rigorous and reproducible TMS paradigms. For efficient and focal stimulation, it is important to position and orient the coil to induce a maximal E-field in the targeted cortical region of interest (ROI). Current coil placement protocols, even with gold-standard neuro-navigation and robotic coil placement methods, have limited precision and require a large computational effort. Therefore, new computational models linking the external coil placement and current to the E-field induced in the brain and accounting for coil placement uncertainty are of critical need.\n\nDuke researchers have developed a novel fast computational auxiliary dipole method (ADM) that improves accuracy of TMS by determining the optimum coil position and orientation. The optimum coil placement maximizes the E-field along a predetermined direction or, alternatively, the overall E-field magnitude in the targeted region. This method can find the optimum coil placement in under 15 min using a laptop computer which enables its routine use for TMS.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), data is acquired by a scanner that sends a sequence of radio frequency (RF) pulses into the tissue placed in a strong magnetic field. The magnetic field causes the spins of protons in the tissue to align. Each RF pulse disrupts this alignment. When the pulse ends, the magnetization of the sample recovers to its resting state, thereby producing another RF signal that is detected and used to create the images. The rate of magnetization recovery in a tissue (T1) is related to the brightness of the tissue on the MR image with shorter T1 resulting in brighter image. Creating the contrast in brightness between different types of tissues is very important for proper diagnostics. Delayed-enhancement MRI is an example of a technique that uses magnetization-flipping inverted recovery (IR) pulses to enhance the contrast between tissues with similar T1 values, such as infarcted cardiac tissue and fat. For brightness contrast to be less sensitive to the delay between an IR and the next RF excitation pulses, a variant of this technique called Phase Sensitive IR (PSIR) is used that incorporates phase information into the image reconstruction process. While PSIR does selectively suppress fat signal, it has limitations as the fat signal doesn\u2019t appear completely black. Moreover, multiple additional RF pulses that are needed to inverse the magnetization result in long acquisition times and relatively large power deposition to the tissue. Therefore, an improved method addressing these issues is of need.\n\nResearchers at Duke Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Center have developed an MRI acquisition and reconstruction method which produces the equivalent of inverting MR signal of selected frequencies but without the application of inversion RF pulses. In their method, MRI datasets are processed by employing _virtual_ frequency-selective inversion (VFSI). By analyzing the phase differences between the reference image dataset and the associated phase reference dataset, the signal from the anatomical material is classified into components having different ranges of resonance frequencies associated with different ranges of phases. Each component then is assigned different visual attributes thus creating a visual contrast between them. This method can be used in place of frequency-selective inversion RF pulses to achieve similar results but with less RF pulses, greatly reducing the power deposition to the tissue. Further, this method reduces inherently occurring RF pulse imperfections resulting in a boost in signal-to-noise ratio. This technology is only available for a non-exclusive license.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Provides a resulting boost in signal-to-noise ratio.\n*   Reduces the amount of RF power absorbed by the patient\u2019s body\n*   Can be used in presence of contrast agents",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Delivery of drugs or therapeutics such as small molecules, peptides, and proteins, in their native form, is limited by their poor stability, low solubility, and short _in vivo_ circulation. These challenges in drug delivery lead to decreased therapeutic efficacy and increased risk of off-target toxicity. Various materials, mostly synthetic polymers like polyethylene glycol (PEG), have been previously designed to deliver drugs. The \u201cstealth\u201d properties of PEG improve solubility and stability of drugs, and reduces their premature clearance from the subject, making PEGylation\u2014the process of attaching drugs to PEG\u2014an important method in the pharmaceutical industry. There are, however, three major shortcomings that undermine the reliability of synthetic polymers as drug delivery vehicles. First, it is well documented that repeated exposure to PEG can produce PEG-specific antibodies that trigger adverse immune responses. Second, synthetic polymers are non-biodegradable, and their effect _in vivo_ post drug delivery is not well understood. Third, intrinsic polydispersity associated with synthetic polymers can lead to a population of drug conjugates with different biological properties, especially with respect to the half-life and immunogenicity. There is a need for efficient delivery of drugs with improved biocompatibility, solubility, stability and half-life, and reduced toxicity.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a class of stealth polymers that are conjugated to drug molecules to improve their delivery. Specifically, these are zwitterionic polypeptides (ZIPPs) that incorporate a zwitterionic sequence within an intrinsically disordered polypeptide motif that impart behavior akin to synthetic stealth polymers like PEG. The inventors have demonstrated that fusing a ZIPP sequence to a peptide drug used for treatment of type-2 diabetes, GLP1, outperformed an uncharged polypeptide of the same molecular weight in a mouse model of type-2 diabetes. The ZIPP technology has also been demonstrated to increase the half-life of paclitaxel by 17-fold compared to free paclitaxel. Treatment of mice with a single dose of ZIPP-paclitaxel nanoparticle led to near-complete eradication of highly aggressive prostate or colon cancer tumors.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   New class of stealth polymers that extend the circulation time of conjugated drugs\n*   Genetically encoded, allowing precise design and manipulation\n*   Offers lower toxicity and better biodegradability than synthetic stealth polymers\n*   Demonstrated a wider therapeutic window than Abraxane, an FDA-approved taxane nanoformulation",

    "ip_description": "Over the past twenty years, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been shown to kill a variety of human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo while remaining innocuous to healthy cells. Unfortunately, the preclinical promise of TRAIL and other agonists of TRAIL receptors (TRAILR1 and TRAILR2) has not translated to clinical efficacy for patients. The majority of primary cancer cells are TRAIL-resistant, including colorectal cancer. The American Cancer Society\u2019s estimates 104,270 new cases of colorectal cancer and 45,230 new cases of rectal cancer in the United States for 2021. There is a need to translate the promising efficacy of TRAIL treatment observed in pre-clinical studies to cancer patients.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a drug combination for treating TRAIL-resistant cancer, including colorectal cancer. Specifically, these are highly potent pro-apoptotic drug combinations comprising a TRAIL receptor agonist (TRA) and targeted sensitizing agents. The inventors used a genetic knockout screen in a TRA-resistant human cancer cell line to identify the genetic markers of resistance. They then developed a set of informed, rational drug combinations that inhibited proteins encoded by the resistance genes, and synergistically sensitized the cell lines to TRA. Two such combinations have induced apoptosis at picomolar EC50 in human patient-derived cell lines ranging in TRA sensitivity from completely resistant to highly sensitive. Drug combinations were evaluated for long-term efficacy in human colorectal cell lines. This technology creates a gel-like depot upon subcutaneous injection that abolished tumors in TRA-sensitive Colo205 mouse xenografts. Additionally, tumor growth inhibition and extended survival were observed using TRA-resistant patient-derived xenografts.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Could better translate the promising pre-clinical efficacy observed for TRAIL treatments to cancer patients\n* Has demonstrated long-term efficacy in human colorectal cancer cell lines\n* Use with multiple compounds allow co-targeting of three distinct anti-apoptotic pathways and provides broad spectrum of use\n* Demonstrated _in vivo_ efficacy using patient-derived subcutaneous xenografts and mouse models",

    "ip_description": "Gene therapy has applications ranging from tissue engineering to vaccine development to infectious disease. Most approaches to deliver nucleic material involve the systemic intravenous delivery of condensed nucleic acid (e.g., within a virus or a synthetic particle). However, this approach suffers from immune recognition, accumulation in first pass organs, and rapid clearance. To circumvent these limitations, local delivery approaches that inject and retain the nucleic acid cargo at desired locations are beneficial. For example, the FDA approved gene therapy voretigene neparvovec delivers AAV directly into the eye by subretinal injection, bypassing immune recognition, first pass organ accumulation, and rapid clearance. While the eye is an enclosed environment and has low risk for gene therapies diffusing to the rest of the body, this is not the case for most organs, which requires an alternative delivery method. There is a need for alternative technologies that enable safe and effective delivery of gene therapies.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a hydrogel scaffold that delivers gene therapies. The scaffold is meant to be pre-loaded with nucleic acids and then injected into the patient to administer gene therapies locally, such as for tissue regeneration and stroke treatment.

While existing technologies can manipulate expression of polyadenylation machinery factors to globally increase or decrease 3\u2019UTR length in a non-specific fashion, current methods cannot directly manipulate the length of a desired 3\u2019UTR in a targeted manner.

    "ip_description": "Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major cause of critical illness in immunocompromised patients. IA is caused by A_spergillus_, a type of fungal mold, and it usually affects the host\u2019s pulmonary structure. While most strains of A_spergillus_ only cause minor allergic reactions, immunocompromised people, specifically oncological patients and organ recipients, are at a high risk of serious illness. While IA has improved treatment owing to better tolerated antifungal agents, the diagnosis of the disease is still a shortcoming. Currently, the most definitive way to diagnose pulmonary IA is by histopathological analysis of lung tissue obtained through biopsy. However, this is often complicated due to comorbid patient risk factors. While other methods, such as cultures from blood or serum and molecular biology are available, they do not provide sufficient speed, specificity, or sensitivity. Therefore, developing new fast, efficient, and safe diagnostic methods to detect pulmonary IA is of critical need.\n\nDuke researchers have identified a novel transcriptomic signature of A_spergillus_ infection. Evaluation of host-derived biomarkers as potential diagnostic aids has been an increasingly prominent diagnostic method. Transcriptomic approaches that capture pathogen-specific host response information have not only proven to be helpful in differentiating infected versus non-infected hosts but also discriminating between bacterial and viral pathogens. However, so far little has been known about how such approaches perform in the setting of fungal infections. The Duke group has examined the host gene expression responses during IA and developed a peripheral blood RNA-based signature of aspergillosis that discriminates between infected and uninfected animals. This signature can serve as a novel host-based diagnostic tool for the detection of IA in human patients.\n\nAdvantages:\n* New robust diagnostic method for _Aspergillus_ infections that is specific and non-invasive.\n* Can diagnose early infections.\n* Can detect the presence of the pathogen in asymptomatic patients and thus aid in preventing the infection spread.",

However, due to the inherent physical constraints of the intraocular cavity, forming knots within the eye to affix hardware or repair damaged structures with sutures is challenging and time-consuming. Specialist surgeons are often required to handle these difficult procedures such as secondary intraocular lens implantation or reconstruction of the iris. In cases where inferior techniques are performed, further damage to the eye such as glaucoma and corneal failure may occur. There is a need for a simpler method of holding tissues together to decrease operation time and increase safety of intraocular fixation techniques.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a delivery system intended to replace sutures in situations such as secondary fixation of intraocular lenses during cataract surgery. Specifically, a memory material that can return to a designated shape, like nitinol springs that are used for treating aneurysms, is collapsed into the device. This memory material is then delivered across the tissues or materials meant to be fixed together in order to secure them once it expands and returns to its designated shape. For example, the inventors have described a device that uses a needle to pass through alternating edges of an iris defect to deliver a memory material polymer that forms a spring that will hold the tissue edges together.\n\nIn addition to applications in the field of ophthalmology, this technology may have broader use in endoscopic surgery and other minimally invasive procedures.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Could decrease operation time and improve safety compared to sutures for certain conditions\n- Particularly useful for iris defect repair, secondary intraocular lens implantation and other intraocular procedures that require suture fixation\n- Could be expanded to applications beyond suturing in ophthalmology",

    "ip_description": "SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, the largest scale respiratory virus pandemic the world has witnessed since the 1918 Spanish flu and that has claimed more than 1.4 million lives worldwide. Coronaviruses (CoV family) generally cause mild flu-like symptoms in humans but have caused two smaller scale pandemics in the last two decades: SARS-CoV (2003) and MERS (2012). Recent phylogenetic mapping traced all human coronaviruses to animal origins. While the middle zoonotic carrier of the virus between the animal of origin and humans seem to vary between CoVs, the chronological surfacing of human CoV pandemics seems to follow a dangerous trend of increasing lethality of each pandemic. While recent treatments have been approved for use within hospital settings, there are no known FDA approved cures for the infection. The current limited tools and lack of novel cures underscore the need for a new approach in developing antivirals that would not only provide novel routes to combat the current pandemic but also provide invaluable information on targetable structures that can aid in the prevention of and fight against future CoV outbreaks.\n\nDuke inventors have reported small molecules intended to serve as lead compounds for CoV RNA-targeted antivirals and chemical probes to further understand CoV RNA biology. Specifically, these are the first small molecules aimed at targeting RNA structures within the 5\u2019-UTR and proximal region of the CoV genome. An amiloride-based small molecule library was screened and select compounds were found that potently inhibited replication competent SARS-CoV-2 as evident in the decreased levels of cell free virions in cell culture supernatants of treated cells.\n\nAdvantages:\n* First small molecules aimed at targeting RNA structures within the 5\u2019-UTR and proximal region of the CoV genome\n* Foundation for effective CoV antivirals\n* Probes for better understanding CoV RNA biology to apply to this pandemic and prepare for those in the future",

    "ip_description": "Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL), or Batten disease, is one of the most prevalent pediatric neurodegenerative disorders which occurs with a frequency of between 2 and 4 in 100,000 live births. It starts at around 4 years of age and it is characterized by blindness, seizures, motor and cognitive decline, and early death. JNCL is caused by mutations in the CLN3 gene. The CLN3 protein (CLN3p) harbors a galactosylceramide (GalCer) lipid raft binding domain and participates in the transport of GalCer from Golgi to lipid rafts in the cell membrane. GalCer content of lipid rafts is important for healthy neurons as it is involved in Schwann cell-axon interactions, oligodendrocyte differentiation and transduction of signals across the myelin membrane. In CLN3-mutant cells, CLN3p with ineffective GalCer binding fails to traffic GalCer to lipid rafts. This alters physiochemical properties and structure and impacts function of the rafts. As a result, CLN3-deficient cells grow slowly and have enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis thus contributing to the neurodegeneration underlying the JNCL disease. To date, JNCL is fatal, and only supportive therapies for it are available. Therefore, finding a treatment for this disease is of critical need. Duke researchers have developed methods for treating JNCL associated with CLN3 deficiency in a patient by supplementing them with an effective amount of GalCer. The treatment has been successfully tested in animal trials, and on cell samples donated by the affected children and their families. Advantages: Halts or delays progression of JNCL disease, Prolongs patients\u2019 lives, improves the quality of life, Ready to be tested in human trials.",

    "ip_description": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the largest underlying cause of mortality in the United States, causing one in every three deaths and costing an estimated $316 billion dollars a year. In recent years, computational models of blood flow that use patient-specific 3D geometries obtained through medical imaging helped researchers and clinicians to improve understanding of CVD progression and aided procedural planning. For example, computation fluid dynamics (CFD) models have been used in the positioning and sizing of stents commonly used to treat certain types of CVD. The process of designing and iterating on vascular simulations requires a set of skills that includes knowledge of software, the ability to manipulate CFD models and their parameters, and the ability to use and analyze blood flow visualization. Current software tools show great promise but because of their complexity, they could be restrictive for efficient and intuitive use by a clinician. Therefore, there is a critical need for more integrative and intuitive software that would allow users to perform hemodynamic simulations without touching the command line or learning 3D modeling technologies.\n\nDuke researchers have developed Harvis, a cardiovascular visualization software with support for both 2D and virtual reality (VR) displays. Harvis provides a GUI interface for HARVEY, a highly parallel CFD solver that performs the vascular simulations, and offers straightforward integration for other flow solvers. When given 3D mesh geometries derived from segmented medical imaging, HARVEY simulations produce maps of parameters (pressure, velocity, and shear stress) associated with the progression and localization of vascular diseases. Harvis streamlines the workflow of configuring, running, and analyzing the results of hemodynamics simulations. For example, users can model the placement of common vascular devices such as conduits and stents and then visualize the flow results in an integrated manner. Harvis supports several common consumer-grade VR devices that have found growing use in scientific visualizations.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Enables accessible and streamlined use of scalable hemodynamic simulations by users of all experience levels.\n- A robust tool for virtual vascular modification and flow visualization.\n- Supports both 2D and VR devices.",

    "ip_description": "Olfactory sensation profoundly influences a person\u2019s quality of life. In addition to the aesthetic aspects of life associated with olfactory sensation, approximately 2 million Americans experience some type of olfactory dysfunction. Studies show that olfactory dysfunction affects at least 1% of the population under the age of 65 years, and well over 50% of the population older than 65 years. The sense of smell determines the flavor of foods and beverages and serves as an early warning system for the detection of environmental hazards, such as spoiled food, leaking natural gas, smoke, or airborne pollutants. However, human olfactory perception differs enormously between individuals. There is a need for methods that can not only identify modulators of olfactory perception, but also take into account olfactory reception variation across people when designing new consumer products or olfactory dysfunction therapeutics.\n\nDuke inventors have developed a system for screening compounds that affect odor perception. This can be used to identify molecules for fragrance and flavor consumer products as well as help create therapeutics that treat olfactory dysfunction. Specifically, this is a cell-based assay comprising the human odorant receptor OR7DR that measures its response to test compounds. The researchers have identified that genetic differences in OR7D4 are linked to the perception of the human sex pheromones androstenone and androstadienone. This was confirmed by demonstrating that genetic variation of OR7DR affected a person\u2019s perception of cooked meats containing androstenone. This technology has been used to screen 66 chemicals of which androstenone and androstadienone were identified as modulators of OR7D4.\n\nThis technology can also be used to help further research into the olfactory system and its connection to other bodily systems, like diminished sensation of smell being linked to neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Easily screens for olfactory modulating compounds or therapeutics that target OR7D4\n* Takes into account the genetic variation responsible for differences in smell perception\n* Identified compounds have been validated to translate well to human olfactory perception",

Currently, the standard of care therapy is nutritional intervention. This requires frequent scheduled meals or snacks and uncooked cornstarch in-between meals to maintain normoglycemia throughout the day and night. Meals and snacks must limit fructose, sucrose and galactose and include complex carbohydrates to prevent excursions in glucose levels due to the effect of an insulin response. Monitoring the metabolic status of patients with GSDI is essential to prevent complications. Monitoring the amount of carbohydrate intake in patients with GSDI is also of prime importance given too much or too little is hazardous, leading to increased glycogen and fat storage in the liver and kidneys or hypoglycemia and late complications respectively. However, there is no single biomarker for monitoring the metabolic status and diet control in patients with GSD I. Current clinical monitoring depends on daily frequent blood glucose checks throughout the day and night using a glucometer or continuous glucose monitor, as well as lactate, uric acid and triglyceride serial evaluations during clinic visits.

Unfortunately, it is also now well documented that only a minority of patients respond to any particular immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) agent. ICB therapy for cancer only works for a subset of patients and tumor types. Additionally, breast cancer remains one of the leading cause of cancer deaths. There is an unmet need to improve response rates for patients treated with ICB therapies and provide clinicians an ability to predict patient responses.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a method to determine whether a breast cancer patient will respond to immune checkpoint therapy. Specifically, they have uncovered a previously unrecognized role of LRRK2 in breast cancer. It was found that tumors harboring a somatic LRRK2 mutation may constitute a distinct clinicopathologic entity with increased tumor mutation burden and high-risk clinical behavior. Reduced patient survival was observed in breast cancer patients with LRRK2 mutations using The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Cancer Project.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Assessing for LRRK2 may identify a subset of genomically unstable breast tumors with vulnerability to immune checkpoint inhibition\n- Offers an opportunity for risk stratification and treatment plans for breast cancer",

Specifically, this is a method to deposit blended thin films using emulsion-based, resonant infrared matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (RIR-MAPLE). Aspects of both physical vapor deposition and solution-processing are combined by first dispersing the target polymer in an emulsion with water to absorb laser energy and then following this with a relatively low energy infrared Er:YAG laser. This technology has been demonstrated to achieve a stabilized power conversion efficiency of over 12% for perovskite solar cells. This technology could be used for a variety of other applications that use blended polymer thin films, including organic electronics, opto-electronics, optics, sensors, and advanced bio-surfaces.

However, it can also be the first indication of serious diseases including severe pneumonia and stage four cancer. It is therefore critical to accurately diagnose the cause of a patient\u2019s pleural effusion so effective treatments can be introduced swiftly if needed. One method currently used for diagnosis is taking a biopsy of the pleural tissue, which can be relatively expensive and invasive. Another common diagnosis method performed approximately 200,000 times every year uses a catheter to drain and partially collect the fluid for testing using a thoracentesis kit. However, only 50 mL of the up to 1.5 L of fluid is analyzed. Notably, up to 50% of these procedures remain undiagnosed after the first drainage and require multiple thoracentesis for a diagnosis.

It often manifests as haze with grainy patterns that overlay the true ultrasound image and reduces the conspicuity of targets by decreasing contrast and obscuring target detail. Major sources of clutter can include reverberation, phase aberration and offaxis scattering from bright reflectors. Studies show that acoustic clutter is the dominant source of image degradation in abdominal imaging. While techniques to improve image quality are being developed, clutter removal remains an unsolved problem despite decades of research.\n\nResearchers from Prof. Gregg Trahey lab have developed a method that enhances ultrasound image quality and automates optimization of imaging frequency. In this method, called lag one coherence (LOC), a series of pre-imaging pulses are transmitted over a range of frequencies. The data from this frequency sweep is processed offline to calculate novel coherence-based \u201cconspicuity metrics\u201d and select the frequency that produces the image with maximal conspicuity. This optimal frequency is then used for target imaging. This process takes fractions of a second and therefore can be performed continuously in real-time. Since the method relies on an analytical approach as opposed to empirical evaluation of image quality, it allows for automation of the process, thus easing work for the scanner operator.

One of the grand challenges in turbomachinery is to predict the vibratory response of blades due to either a self-induced excitation (flutter) or an external excitation which could be due to several factors including inlet distortions and resonant crossings. These vibrations can result in damage and costly maintenance of turbines, or even lead to catastrophic engine failure. One of the most important effects causing vibrations is variation in the individual frequency of blades which could occur either in the manufacturing process or due to modifications during the operation cycle and is known as the mistuning effect. This small difference in the blade frequency can lead to an amplification in the response and have a severe impact at a resonant crossing. The most important aspect in solving vibration problems is to predict the blade response and design the blade to prevent vibration amplification. Therefore, computational tools with high fidelity models which can predict the response accurately in the shortest period of time are of critical need.\n\nDuke researchers have developed the computational package that predicts the blade response amplitudes of a turbomachine that is either self-excited or excited by an external forcing function. Unique computational capabilities of this package make it robust and capable of handling any embedded rotor system subjected to any kind of variation in the flow field or system parameters.

    "ip_description": "Delivery and therapeutic efficacy of small molecule imaging agents and chemotherapeutics are hampered by their short half-life, low solubility, non-selectivity to cancer cells, and toxic side effects. Small molecule chemotherapeutics, although in routine use for cancer treatment, suffer from a short circulation half-life and indiscriminate accumulation in healthy tissues that result in systemic toxicities and hence limit their maximum dose. These limitations inhibit accumulation of chemotherapeutics in tumors at therapeutic levels and limit their clinical application. Efforts in past decades have been focused on developing macromolecular and nanoparticulate drug formulations that prevent first-pass elimination in kidneys and allow for selective accumulation in tumors via the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. However, the interaction of these macromolecule and nanoparticle carriers with serum proteins and components of the immune system is not well understood and is affected by several factors such as their interfacial chemistry, size, shape and stability which makes their optimization difficult. Therefore, there remains a need for new delivery systems that can overcome these disadvantages yet provide efficacy for delivery of small molecule imaging agents and chemotherapeutics. Duke inventors have developed a tumor-targeting composition for delivering chemotherapeutics or imaging agents. Specifically, an albumin binding domain is conjugated to cargo which harnesses favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics through its binding specificity to endogenous albumin.

Treatments with anti-inflammatory drugs often prove ineffective, whereas opiates carry a risk of tolerance and addiction, especially with long-term use. The mechanisms that regulate resolution of inflammation and pain are not well understood. Research has revealed that the resolution of inflammation is an active process involving the production of specialized pro-resolution factors. These endogenous lipid mediators act on their respective G-protein-coupled receptors in immune cells to suppress pain. Thus, insights into mechanisms that can harness pro-resolution factors could lead to the development of more effective analgesics.\n\nResearchers at Duke have discovered a method for treating pain and inflammation using a composition including a GPR37 agonist.

Currently, because of the complexity of the linac engineering and the requirement of the dose rate output, the standard design of a linac only allows two to three photon energies to be available. Should more photon energies be desired on a single linac, a significant increase in the cost of engineering, manufacturing, commissioning and maintenance would arise. The choice of photon energy in the treatment plan is currently based largely on experience of the operator and the available photon energies on the linac. There is a need to improve photon energy access in order to improve treatment plans and patient outcomes.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a system for expanding the available photon energies used with traditional radiation treatments. This technology is intended to be incorporated into existing linacs or used to develop a new linac design. This technology is capable of synthetically producing a photon beam of arbitrary \u201ceffective energy\u201d using only the nominal photon energies available on a given linac. This is done with a weighted combination of the nominal photon energies and can vary based on gantry angle and patient anatomy. In doing so, treatment plans can be made portable between linacs with different operating energies. Treatment planning systems will also be able to optimize over a continuum of effective energies, which may vary in space and gantry angle. This provides complete flexibility in the possible solution space to the treatment plan design.

    "ip_description": "Lymphomas are highly diverse and among the most common cancers in the US; approximately 1 in 50 Americans will be diagnosed with a lymphoma in their lifetime. Standard therapy for lymphomas generally includes chemotherapy, and while some cases are successfully treated, recurrence frequently occurs. The PI3K pathway is a desirable target for cancer therapy due to its well-characterized oncogenic function in a large variety of cancers, including lymphomas. However, even among patients with histologically similar malignancies, researchers and clinicians have long recognized distinct heterogeneity in terms of clinical course and response to particular therapies, which has greatly complicated traditional treatment efforts. Efforts have thus begun aimed at identifying molecular traits that will predict responsiveness and/or resistance to available treatment options for a given subject. With such knowledge, a doctor attending to different patients diagnosed with nominally similar tumors could tailor individual treatment plans for those patients based on detectable molecular differences between their cancer cells\u2014an approach often referred to as \u201cpersonalized medicine.\u201d The development of robust methods for the targeted treatment of patients suffering from lymphomas and other disorders holds great promise for improving standard medical care.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a method for determining a patient\u2019s resistance to PI3K inhibitors. This is intended to be used as a companion diagnostic for treating blood cancers. Specifically, Dr. Dave and colleagues have discovered that PAK1 expression was associated with resistance to PI3K pathway inhibition. The inventors studied the effectiveness of PI3K pathway inhibitors against 60 lymphoma cell lines, spanning multiple lymphoma subtypes, and demonstrated that PI3K pathway inhibition could effectively inhibit the growth of a broad range of lymphoma subtypes. Interestingly, their studies identified drug-sensitive and drug-resistant lymphoma lines within a shared histological classification, indicating that distinct lymphoma subtypes exhibit molecular heterogeneity that affects treatment outcome. Through RNA-interference mediated knock-down of the PAK1 gene, they demonstrated a dramatic increase in the sensitivity to PI3K inhibition. They further tested a small molecule inhibitor of PAK1 and found significant synergy between PI3K inhibition and PAK1 inhibition.\n\nThis technology also includes methods for treating blood cancers. The pharmacological inhibition of PAK1 synergistically potentiated the effects of PI3K pathway inhibitors against drug-resistant lymphomas, suggesting that PI3K pathway inhibitors may have utility for the treatment of a diverse array of lymphomas using this technology. Due to the relatively conserved nature of protein function across cell types, PAK1 may also contribute to PI3K inhibitor resistance in non-lymphoma tumors. Thus, the application of this technology may extend beyond lymphomas.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Offers a method for predicting therapeutic outcome of PI3K inhibitors to help improve patient outcomes for those with lymphomas\n* Also offers a method to synergistically enhance the effectiveness of PI3K pathway inhibitors through PAK1 modulation",

More than 11.5 million persons 12 years and older misuse prescription opioids and opioid overdose deaths have become a major public health crisis. The total economic burden of opioid dependence and deaths is estimated at $78.5 billion per year. FDA-approved therapies for chronic pain are primarily opioid-based, maintaining patients in a dependent state that complicates their long-term treatment. Therefore, the development of an effective non-opioid therapy is necessary. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) glutamate receptor, which mediates opioid-dependent neuroadaptive changes, is an attractive therapeutic target. Studies have shown that its modulation may reverse these changes and attenuate opioid withdrawal. However, known NMDA receptor antagonists (ex. ketamine) exhibit human abuse profile or limited efficacy, preventing their use as an effective therapy for opioid dependence. There is a need for opioid dependence treatment options that provide patients with high efficacy, low side effects, and avoid continuing to introduce opioid-based active ingredients.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a method of treating opioid dependence using NDMA partial agonists. Specifically, agonist activity at the NMDA receptor decreases the number of glutamate receptor expressed in the postsynaptic neuron, potentially promoting enhanced recovery from opioid dependence. Using a rodent model of opioid dependence, the inventors showed that Rapastinel administration outperformed ketamine in attenuating withdrawal and preventing relapse in both adolescents and adults. Moreover, this method did not produce ketamine-like negative dissociative effects, promising an innovative and safe solution to treat opioid dependence.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Outperforms ketamine in attenuating opioids withdrawal symptoms and preventing relapse in rodent model\n* Well-tolerated safety profile of NDMA receptor agonists with minimum negative side effects demonstrated in human clinical trials\n* Non-opioid nature minimizes further opioid exposure during patient treatment",

Stress tolerance, which includes low soil fertility and drought conditions, are relevant to both crop yield and where crops may be grown, which is relevant to farms at all scales. Heat and drought are the two most important stresses that affect crop production and food security worldwide. Current efforts to combat these abiotic stresses are genetic techniques, such as transgenics or breeding for stress tolerance. Other efforts include inducing stress resistance by the addition of certain chemicals, in order to prepare them for drought conditions. A further important approach is the exogenous application of growth promoters. Here, the inventors identified novel plant hormones that increase the growth and integrity of plants. Because these compounds are plant derivatives, this technique increases the growth of plants in a sustainable and efficient way.\n\nDuke researchers have identified four novel beta-carotene derived apocaratenals (Apo-10-carotenal, apo-12-carotenal, apo-14-carotenal, and apo-16-carotenal) that promote root growth in _Arabidopsis thaliana_ through a screen for compounds that rescue root growth. These compounds are metabolites of beta-carotenes, common pigments found in plants. The data shows that these hormones rescue the length of roots and subsequent plant growth after root growth has been inhibited. These results suggest that in conditions where growth is reduced (such as in a drought), growth could be rescued with the addition of these plant hormones. These beta-carotene metabolites (apocarotenals) thus could play a role in promoting root growth at a larger scale.

    "ip_description": "The taste system is essential for feeding and survival as it helps humans evaluate the nutritional content in food. Every year, taste and smell dysfunctions affect more than 200,000 people, including those undergoing viral infections and chemotherapy. The resulting loss of appetite complicates the recovery and outcome of these patients. Researchers and clinicians wishing to manage taste dysfunction require extensive knowledge of taste receptors composition and research tools to study them, but they are often lacking. Sour taste receptors, for example, are critical for maintaining acid-base balance, yet their compositions and physiology were unknown. Additionally, sour taste is an attractive quality to modulate in food and pharmaceutical industries, whose global market is projected to reach over USD 16 billion in 2024. A high-throughput platform to study the mechanism of sour taste receptors and screen for compounds that can modulate their activity would be of considerable interest to both clinicians and industry researchers.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a method for identifying sour-taste receptor ligands as well as compounds that modulate their activity. This valuable tool provides a platform for clinicians who study sour taste receptor physiology as well as food and pharmaceutical industries who wish to screen molecules that modulate sour taste sensation.

    "ip_description": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults affecting approximately 100 million people worldwide. Studies show that early detection and treatment can reduce the risk of blindness by 95% in patients with DR. It is therefore recommended by the American Diabetes Association and the American Academy of Ophthalmology that all type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients have a comprehensive eye exam performed annually to screen for early signs of DR. Unfortunately, DM patient compliance rates with eye exams are low, often reported as under 50%. Thus, health insurance plans are highly incentivized to ensure that their DM patients receive annual eye exams. The requirement for DR screening can be met by acquiring a fundus photograph and having this photograph interpreted by a qualified professional. This has spurned the creation of several telemedicine DR screening companies who send technicians to visit patients in their homes, or in community clinics, to acquire images with handheld fundus cameras (HFCs). These images are then interpreted remotely by an ophthalmologist, typically through a dedicated reading network. Unfortunately, gradeability rates of images acquired with HFCs are poor, largely due to glare and vignetting. Many of the causes of poor gradeability rates with HFCs can be significantly improved using CSLO. Unfortunately, commercially available CSLO technologies are too bulky and too expensive for use in telemedicine and remote screening applications.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (CSLO) intended for remote screening and telemedicine applications either as a handheld device or mounted on a portable chin rest. This technology is based on a more generalizable imaging approach called confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). The small-footprint system topology was achieved by employing a time-division spectral multiplexing scheme that reduces complexity and cost. A working prototype has successfully imaged a healthy human volunteer.\n\nThis invention is not limited to CSLO applications and is generalizable to other forms of polychromatic point scanning imaging systems, including but not limited to confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM).\n\nAdvantages:\n* A novel system topology that can be used to reduce both system size and cost, making feasible the development of low cost, handheld embodiments of CSLO\n* Offers images with improved gradeability compared to HFCs traditionally used in telemedicine\n* Could improve patient compliance and prevent blindness for those with diabetic retinopathy",

The most typical use for adipic acid is for the synthesis of nylon-6,6 used in upholstery, auto parts, apparel, and other products. Standard industrial methods for adipic acid synthesis are costly and have major drawbacks including consumption of fossil fuels, inefficient yields, and production of greenhouse gases. To address this need, \u201cgreener\u201d methods for adipic acid production have been demonstrated, but these methods have not been widely adopted, in part because they depend on large-scale hydrogen peroxide oxidation, or because they couple otherwise environmentally friendly fermentation reactions with non-biological synthetic reactions.

The inventors demonstrated that the enzyme was specific for 2-oxoadipate; they did not see any activity when incubating with other dicarboxylic acids. They also confirmed with LC/MS/MS studies that they produced only the (_R_) enantiomer.\n\nThis technology could be used to generate other chiral chemicals that require the conversion of 1-carboxy-2-ketoacid to 1-carboxy-(_R_)-2-hydroxyacid, or the reverse reaction.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Could enable a less expensive bio-based method for producing adipic acid with fewer environmental impacts than current method\n* Completely specific for 1-carboxy-2-ketoacid substrate and generating the (_R_) enantiomer product\n* Can be used to catalyze the generation of other industrial chiral chemicals",

    "ip_description": "Metastases, the spread of cancer cells to new areas of the body, are common and devastating complications of many kinds of cancers. For instance, bone metastasis occurs in 73% of advanced breast cancer patients while 90% of lung cancer patients\u2019 deaths are linked to metastasis. Moreover, about 40% of the most common form of lung cancer cases, non-small cell lung carcinoma, exhibit bone metastasis. When cancer cells invade into other parts of the body, they produce molecules that promote tumor growth. As a result, both breast and lung cancer metastases are associated with high mortality and morbidity. However, there are no available therapies to cure breast and lung cancer metastases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify molecules that could be targeted to prevent and disrupt metastases.\n\nThe Pendergast lab has discovered an ABL-specific inhibitor that can potentially be developed into a treatment for metastatic breast and lung cancer. Inventors have noticed that increased expression of ABL kinases correlated with enhanced breast and lung cancer metastases and ABL kinases were essential in promoting breast and lung cancer cell metastases. Studies with both cell lines and animal models have demonstrated that when ABL kinases were suppressed, cancer cells\u2019 ability to invade into other parts of the body is greatly impaired. In addition, cancer cells\u2019 survivals in the metastatic sites were reduced with ABL kinase depletion. Therefore, ABL kinases are potential therapeutic targets that can prevent and disrupt breast and lung cancer metastasis. To target ABL kinases, inventors have designed a novel ABL-specific inhibitor. Unlike other ABL kinase inhibitors that target the kinase domain and have off-target effects with other kinases, this ABL-specific inhibitor binds to a different site. As predicted, the ABL-specific inhibitor can effectively inhibit ABL activity while maintaining specificity. This newly developed ABL-specific inhibitor significantly reduced breast and lung cancer metastases in both cell line and animal model studies.\n\nThis invention can potentially be used in cancers that have increased ABL kinases activity including liver, uterine, kidney carcinomas.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Novel therapeutic target for treating breast and lung cancer progression and metastasis\n* New ABL kinase inhibitors that have greater specificity\n* Promising results in both cell line and animal model studies\n* When combined with existing treatments, this invention may help increase cancer cells sensitivity to chemotherapy",

This technology is intended to help pathologists preview samples with the likelihood and location of cancer. With this invention, pathologists will know where to image and thus improve efficiency in workflow. Inventors take advantage of the fact that different tissue types (i.e. cancer, adipose, fibroglandular) display unique X-ray diffraction (XRD) signatures. They developed a coded aperture XRD imaging system using a line of broadband X-rays, a coded aperture, and energy-sensitive detectors. When the X-ray beam goes through a tissue specimen, it undergoes coherent scatter and gets deflected. The scattered X-rays could be detected by the energy-sensitive detectors to extract scatter information. Inventors then implemented algorithms to automatically process data acquired, and the material composition of the imaged sample can be represented with color-coding depicting the likelihood of cancer. When validated with a phantom material consisting of five different materials, this novel XRD imaging system was capable of obtaining a depth-resolved, color-coded representation of the object accurately identifying locations of cancer.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Damage to the lung epithelium in response to pathogens is a major health problem worldwide. Parenchymal lung infections disrupt lung epithelial architecture and function by eliciting destruction of airway and alveolar cell populations. Currently there are no approved drugs that directly prevent or repair epithelial cell damage following pathogen-induced lung injury. Therapeutic strategies to protect or promote lung epithelial cell regeneration following injury could profoundly improve patient outcomes when used in combination with antibiotics and supportive care, particularly in the context of infections caused by viruses or resistant bacterial strains. This invention describes a novel treatment strategy for promoting lung repair after injury, a finding that could profoundly reduce mortality after respiratory infections or chemical exposure.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a novel therapeutic method intended to treat lung epithelium damage. They have discovered a previously unknown role for Abelson (Abl) kinases in the regulation of regeneration in the lung epithelium after pathogen-induced injury. The Abl kinases, Abl1 and Abl2, are a family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that regulate a wide variety of cellular processes during development and normal homeostasis, but can have deleterious effects on cell survival, proliferation, and cell-cell junction adhesion upon their upregulation following inflammation, tumorigenesis, and oxidative stress. The inventors discovered, using in vitro and in vivo models, that genetic and pharmacological inactivation of Abl kinases mobilizes secretory cells from the distal airway and bronchioalveolar duct junction to promote the expansion of double-positive SCGB1A1+ SPC+ cells leading to enhanced regeneration of the damaged lung alveolar epithelium following bacterial infection induced by live S. aureus and other bacterial and viral pathogens. This technology has been demonstrated with mouse models.\n\nThis technology has been demonstrated in mouse models of pathogen-induced lung injury, and has shown that these effects are mediated by a dramatic expansion of progenitor lung epithelial cells that induce lung regeneration after pathogen infection (viral and bacterial). Thus, the ABL kinase inhibitors may have dual effects by targeting the virus (including coronavirus) and also promoting regeneration of the host lung epithelium. A 2018 publication from Machamer and colleagues supports the applicability of this technology as an antiviral for coronavirus.\n\nAdvantages:\n* There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for improving respiratory tract injury repair and this invention could be a first in class therapy for such repair\n* Abl kinase inhibitors have already been approved for other indications",

    "ip_description": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) allows non-invasive stimulation of neurons in the brain using strong, brief magnetic pulses that induce electrical currents in neurons. TMS is widely used for probing brain function and it is an FDA approved treatment for depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, smoking cessation, and migraine. A significant limitation of TMS, however, is that the magnetic pulse delivery is associated with an undesirable loud clicking sound reaching as high as 130 dB. The loud noise significantly impedes both basic research and clinical applications of TMS as it can interfere with accurate brain stimulation and can be potentially damaging to the patient\u2019s hearing. There is a need for maintaining the increasing utility of TMS while minimizing the limitations associated with the loud coil click.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a device design intended to reduce sound emissions during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Specifically, this is a new double containment coil with enhanced winding mounting (DCC), which utilizes acoustic impedance mismatch to contain and dissipate the impulsive sound within an air-tight outer casing. The coil winding is potted in a rigid block, which is mounted to the outer casing by its acoustic nodes that are subject to minimum vibration during the pulse. The rest of the winding block is isolated from the casing by an air gap, and sound is absorbed by foam within the casing. The casing thickness under the winding center is minimized to maximize the coil electric field output. A prototype has been developed in the lab.\n\nThis technology suits both as a plug-and-play replacement to conventional TMS coils, or to be used in combination with other sound reduction techniques.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Offers acoustic noise reduction comparable to that provided by typical hearing protection devices\n* Compared to commercial TMS coils, the Duke prototype has 14\u201337 dB lower noise at matched stimulation strength\n* Provides 22% higher maximum stimulation strength than similar commercial coils\n* Can enhance hearing safety and reduce auditory co-activations in the brain and other detrimental effects of TMS sound",

However, glatiramoids have yet to demonstrate enough clinical efficacy to be approved for any diseases beyond multiple sclerosis. The biophysical properties have long been suspected to be relevant to the efficacy of glatiramoids, but they cannot be easily adjusted in conventional randomized polypeptides in order to optimize their therapeutic benefit.\n\nDuke researchers have invented a platform for creating glatiramoid-based immunomodulatory biomaterials with improved control over the biophysical properites.

The direct measurement of radiation dose could alleviate these issues, but the current scintillators display many inconvenient characteristics, such as requiring large spatial dimensions, a dependence on cryogenic cooling, high limits of detection, or sensing elements that are hygroscopic.\n\nDuke\u2019s new technology has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the tissue-specific doses of radiation received by the patients for any given diagnostic or therapeutic procedure.

Treatment of cryptococcal infections is notoriously difficult, and new antifungal regimens are urgently required. In general, there is a clear need for new strategies to identify antimicrobial therapeutics with minimal toxicity to host cells in the face of escalating antibiotic resistance and lethal fungal infections. Duke inventors have reported new compounds for treating microbial infections. This new approach harnesses copper mobilization in phagosomes in combination with another key aspect of the antimicrobial defenses there: the rapid release of reactive oxygen species. This association allows the prodrug QBP to become activated to form antimicrobial 8-hydroxyquinolone (8HQ)-copper complexes. Crucially, these complexes can overcome microbial copper defenses to result in pathogen killing. These compounds were used successfully to reduce the fungal burden in the lungs of infected mice.

The major application of DTI is the neuroimaging of white matter of the brain. However, DTI is susceptible to artifacts caused by distortions, blurring, and misalignment among images. To avoid these types of artifacts, a large number of scans is required, thereby greatly limiting the utility of the imaging technique. Thus, there is a need to decrease artifacts and improve the accuracy in diffusion tensor measurements. Dr. Nan-Kuei Chen and colleagues at Duke have developed a method to correct for artifacts in clinical magnetic resonance diffusion imaging. The method can correct various types of artifacts resulting from both system-dependent Eddy current effect and subject-dependent susceptibility field gradients in acquired diffusion imaging data. The solution consists of four components: 1) a blipped acquisition method to correct for signal loss, 2) an improved reconstruction method to correct for reconstruction errors, 3) an echo time modification method to correct for signal intensity changes, and 4) a dynamic magnetic field mapping method to correct for spatial and temporal variations. The method is highly applicable to a range of acquisition methods, including but not limited to echo-planar imaging and spiral imaging. Advantages: Effectively and efficiently correct multiple artifacts in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, Provides a high signal-to-noise ratio signal, Compatible with a wide range of acquisition modes, including echo-planar, spiral, partial Fourier echo-planar, and parallel imaging techniques, Can be widely used in all clinical applications of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Small molecule cancer drugs often suffer from poor systemic exposure, resulting from their low water solubility and short plasma half-life. Additionally, the off-target toxicity is the main challenge that undermines efficacy. Nanoparticle drug delivery systems, such as self-assembling micelles, can solve these problems when carrying chemotherapeutic agents by improving the drug pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution. However, micelles are often unstable and quickly removed from systematic circulation because they\u2019re preferentially taken up by macrophages. Therefore, there remains a need for new nanoparticulate drug delivery systems that can overcome these disadvantages yet provide efficacy for delivery of poorly water-soluble anti-cancer agents. Duke inventors have reported a nanoparticle drug delivery system intended to improve the uptake of poorly water-soluble small molecule cancer drugs by tumors. These nanoparticles encapsulate small molecule cancer drugs and bind endogenous albumin upon intravenous injection. Albumin is present in millimole concentrations in blood, making this a simple and attractive strategy for improving circulation. The synthesis of the nanoparticles was achieved by fusing the gene encoding a protein-G derived albumin binding domain to that of a chimeric polypeptide, and the ABD-CP fusion was recombinantly synthesized by bacterial expression of the gene. The polypeptides exhibit lower critical solution temperature phase behavior, enabling them to form gel-like depots that increase the half-life of their cargo. Animal studies have demonstrated increased plasma stability and tumor uptake of nanoparticles carrying doxorubicin, a common chemotherapeutic agent. Advantages include a simple, attractive method for improving the efficacy of poorly soluble cancer drugs by taking advantage of endogenous blood albumin, a 6-fold increase in blood plasma exposure shown in canine studies, increased uptake of doxorubicin by tumors demonstrated in mouse models, and unlike other methods for coating nanoparticles with albumin, this strategy avoids the extra processing steps during nanoparticle synthesis that can cause conformational changes in the structure of albumin that can lead to immunogenicity.",

Ongoing difficulty in safely treating pain has led to the current opioid crisis in the United States. Additionally, pain medications that lack target selectivity often have strong side-effects such as gastrointestinal distress, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures. Although non-selective have been developed, these are generally accompanied by serious side-effects. The need for safe, specific, non-addictive opioid alternatives for the treatment of chronic pain is high.\n\nResearchers at Duke University have identified novel small molecules for the treatment of chronic pain. These small molecule antagonists bind to and inhibit the sodium ion channel Nav1.7, which has been shown to be essential for sensing pain. Duke researchers have developed multiple Nav1.7-specific inhibitors using virtual compound screening and computer-aided drug design. These inhibitors show promising activity in cell-based assays and one lead compound has demonstrated _in vivo_ analgesic and anti-itch efficacy in mouse models.\n\nNav1.7-specific inhibitor also demonstrates anti-itch activity that could be applied to patients experiencing chronic itch.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Novel Nav1.7-specific inhibitors that reduce inflammatory and neuropathic pain in mouse models of chronic pain\n* _In silico_ screening of small molecules identified antagonists that selectively bound to key regions of Nav1.7 ion channel which limits risk of side effects\n* A non-addictive opioid alternative",

Although investigators in academia and industry are fervently working on designing new antimicrobials, real progress in these endeavors has been slow. Moreover, history indicates that any success in the development of novel antibiotics will probably continue to be short-lived because of the rapid generation of resistance. Ultimately, there is a need for a fundamentally different approach to the treatment of infections, particularly those involving antibiotic-resistant organisms.\n\nThis technology could also offer a treatment strategy for patients with a variety of conditions including viral infections, obesity, colitis, graft-versus-host disease, and alcohol liver disease.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a method for preventing and treating bacterial infections that is intended to be given to patients as an alternative to traditional antibiotics.

    "ip_description": "Bone fractures occur in 50% of the population, causing significant morbidity and mortality and costing the US health care system over $20 billion annually. Complications, such as nonunion or delayed union, occur in 5%\u201310% of fracture cases, and this rate is increased in the elderly population. One of the most common health issues in the elderly is bone degradation that can lead to bone fractures. This condition can be detrimental for the elderly due to slow bone healing, and statistics show that every 3 seconds there is a bone fracture occurring. While there are preventative medications to decrease bone fractures, currently, there are no reliable therapeutics to help bones heal after a fracture occurs in the elderly. Because of this unmet need, there is an interest in identifying new therapies to help bone fracture healing.\n\nIn previous studies, Dr. Baht discovered that there are multiple proteins that change as an individual ages. One protein of interest is a lipoprotein that has been shown to be correlated to decreased bone healing and through Dr. Baht studies, increases as people age. Furthermore, in osteoblast, adding lipoprotein decreased bone healing markers in vitro. In a more clinically relevant scenario, using a viral vector to decreased lipoprotein in aged mice with bone fractures showed that decreasing circulating levels of the lipoprotein lead to increased bone healing. This finding suggests that, by reducing or inhibiting this lipoprotein can be used as a therapeutic to increase age-related bone fractures.\n\nOther Applications:\n* Lipoproteins have also been associated to promote pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and atherosclerosis. Reducing lipoprotein levels in these patients could have a positive therapeutic effect.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Current intervention therapeutics includes preventative measure therapies (Prolia\u00ae and Fosamax) that only benefit certain elderly population, while removal of circulating lipoprotein through a gene therapy approach would benefit all individuals at risk or with bone fractures.\n* Second intervention for standard of care can include bone grafts, but these are only applicable to easy to access bone fractures.

Potential clinical applications of UV-VIS DRS include precancer detection and cancer diagnostics, intraoperative tumor margin assessment, and monitoring of tumor response to chemotherapy, to name just a few examples. Calibration of the diffuse reflectance spectrum for instrument response and time-dependent fluctuation as well as interdevice variations is complicated, time consuming, and potentially inaccurate. Current calibration methods cannot correct for real-time system fluctuations, such as variations in the lamp intensity, and thus require at least 30 min for lamp warm up, which is a significant problem in a clinical setting such as the operating room. Second, they can require an additional 10\u201320 min before or after the clinical measurement for calibration.

The use of such technology for early detection of diseases is invaluable. For example, each year in the United States, numerous women are diagnosed with breast cancer.

The strategic location at the host\u2013environment interface and the expression of a wide range of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) allow MCs to serve as immune surveillance cells, and these cells play a critical host-protective role as a first line of defense through innate immune responses. In addition, the expression of receptors on MCs recognizing activated complement, endogenous peptides (antimicrobial peptides, neuropeptides, etc.), exogenous venom peptides, and interleukin-33 (IL33) can amplify proinflammatory responses and modulate immune responses. The immune regulatory role of MCs is particularly supported by the fact that MCs have a capacity to pre-store proteases, cytokines, biogenic amines, and other mediators that can be instantly released at the recognition of trigger stimuli. In addition to pre-stored mediators, MCs produce and secrete a wide range of cytokines and chemokines through de novo synthesis. While MCs are known to regulate innate and adaptive immunity, and MC activators have recently been described as safe and effective vaccine adjuvants, many currently known MC activators are inadequate for in vivo applications, however, and research on identifying novel MC activators is limited.\n\nDuke inventors have reported novel small molecules that act as mast cell activators intended to be developed as vaccine adjuvants. After identification of small molecules with mast cell activating activity, the inventors performed medicinal chemistry to develop novel small molecules with mast cell activating activity similar to or superior to the parent compounds. These novel small molecules were tested for vaccine adjuvant activity in mice.\n\nThis technology could be used as adjuvants for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Small molecules that activate mast cells (MCs) and can be used as vaccine adjuvants\n- Synthesis of compounds is easier than related polymers or synthetic peptides and is expected to cost less\n- Promote de novo synthesis of cytokines and induce the release of eicosanoids from human to mouse MCs",

First, pathologists are required to travel to the site of explant at all times of the day or night, which has the potential to delay organ allocation. Second, the evaluation of donor kidney biopsies generally relies on the surgical pathologist on call, who often does not have formal training in renal pathology. These pathology reviews have high inter-reader variability relative to a trained nephropathologist. Rapid, reproducible, and accurate assessment of frozen tissue from donor kidney biopsies is critical to successful renal allograft transplantation. Such pathological assessment carries major clinical impact, including (a) reducing the number of discarded organs otherwise suitable for transplantation, (b) preventing the use of non-viable kidneys or kidneys with an already limited nephron reserve, and (c) predicting the allograft function and longevity in the transplant recipient. The ability to predict implant function and longevity across a widening pool of donor organs is thus becoming an essential component to precision kidney transplant medicine.\n\nDuke inventors have developed an algorithm to assess frozen kidney donors to assist pathologists in properly predicting a successful implant. A deep convolutional neural network is used to automatically detect and segment normal glomeruli on whole slide image from donor frozen sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Over 250 renal biopsies harvested and processed (frozen, cut, and stained) have been manually segmented from Duke hospital and others institutions, providing thousands of glomeruli for training the CNN.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Can help standardize and improve the clinical process of assessing frozen tissues from donor kidney biopsies\n* Has been trained using thousands of glomeruli\n* Proof-of-concept has been demonstrated in the lab and hospital validation is planned",

Accurate assessment of these properties is invaluable for early detection, diagnosis and prognosis of diseases such as cancer and fibrosis. In the last two decades, ultrasound shear wave elastography imaging (SWEI) has emerged as a promising imaging tool that is capable of directly and _noninvasively_ measure tissue stiffness. The basic principle of SWEI relies on the generation of shear waves in the tissue of interest and subsequently the analysis of their propagation by ultrasonic echolocation. The method has shown success in clinical applications such as early breast cancer detection and liver diseases, skin diseases and heart echocardiography. However, current methods require a trade-off between analyzing larger regions of interest and improving resolution.

The method uses an acoustic radiation force pulse generator, ultrasonic transducer array with multiple elements at multiple positions, a corresponding array of multiple signal detectors at plurality of positions, and a sophisticated algorithm to analyze data from multiple detectors. The multi-resolution signals are then reconstructed to generate a noise-robust, high-resolution image of the mechanical parameter of the tissue. All steps of this process are computer controlled with a software adaptable to a variety of scenarios.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Non-invasive measurement of living tissue stiffness\n* Generates noise-robust, high-resolution, real-time elastography images\n* Demonstrates the quality and diagnostic usefulness of shear wave images",

Heart health is especially important to monitor in patients who use mechanical support devices, such as left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Up to half of patients with LVADs develop arrhythmias, which need to be closely monitored using ECGs. However, LVADs produce electromagnetic energy that interferes with ECGs, making the measurements difficult to interpret and leading to possible misdiagnosis of cardiac issues. LVADs often produce high frequency electromagnetic signals that cause interference on ECGs; however, the heart produces valuable electrical information in this range, so blocking out all high frequency signals is not feasible. There are over 9,000 LVAD implantations annually, and the LVAD market is expected to increase in the coming years due to a steadily ageing population in the US. Therefore, there is a clinical and commercial need to develop signal processing technologies that effectively filter out the interference produced by LVADs to enable the accuracy of ECGs in LVAD patients and easier diagnosis of arrhythmias and other cardiac issues.\n\nThis technology can also be applied to remove electromagnetic interference from other medical devices that emit high frequency electromagnetic signals, including deep brain stimulators.\n\nPhysicians at the Duke School of Medicine have created a data processing algorithm intended to improve the clarity of ECGs for patients with LVADs. This technology isolates and removes the specific frequency of LVAD interference which preserves the relevant physiological information from the low and high frequency ranges. Specifically, this excludes a narrow frequency band based on the device-specific interference to preserve the key cardiac body surface potentials.\n\nThis algorithm has been tested for its efficacy in patients with several different commercially available LVAD systems and has demonstrated increased clarity of ECG signal.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Facilitates easier diagnosis of cardiac problems in this vulnerable group by enabling clearer ECG measurements from patients while preserving important biological measurements\n* This algorithm has been successfully validated in patients with several commercially available LVAD systems, including HeartWare, HeartMate II, and HeartMate 3\n* Filters out LVAD interference while preserving biological signals within the same frequency range, which is crucial for monitoring cardiac health without compromising data quality\n* A data post-processing method that can be applied quickly and easily to existing electrocardiogram measurement systems without the purchase of new hardware",

ARV can be caused by many viruses including human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. These viruses can be associated with a range of clinical severity from being largely asymptomatic to mild, self-limited illness to respiratory failure and death. Influenza alone causes 25 to 50 million infections annually in the USA, resulting in several hundred thousand hospitalizations and 20-40,000 deaths. Despite viral etiologies driving most cases of acute respiratory infection, definitive diagnostic tools for these syndromes are lacking.

The infectious diseases caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria pose serious threats to humankind. There clearly is an urgent need for new antibiotics, particularly those with novel mechanisms of action. The gene LpxC encodes the enzyme that is involved in the synthesis of lipid A which is an essential component of all Gram-negative bacteria. Inhibiting the enzymatic activity of LpxC would help to defeat the resistance mechanisms. Scientists first suggested targeting LpxC as a treatment strategy more than 20 years ago, but researchers have been unable to identify a compound that was safe at effective dosage levels. Duke researchers have synthesized novel antibiotics that inhibit LpxC, an essential enzyme of the lipid A biosynthetic pathway in Gram-negative bacteria. Being LpxC inhibitors they target a pathway that has never been exploited by current antibiotics, and therefore they should be very effective for multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria. These components have been shown to be effective _in vitro_ against a broad panel of Gram-negative clinical isolates, including several multiresistant and extremely drug-resistant strains involved in nosocomial infections.

    "ip_description": "Stem cell research and medicine in recent years has yielded various therapies for the treatment of numerous diseases. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) are found in both the bone marrow and blood and are responsible for the formation of mature red and white cells. During tissue injury, such as radiation exposure, HSPCs are known to be localized to the site of damage to promote regeneration. However, extrinsic factors often negatively regulate HSPCs into premature death causing decreased tissue regeneration. There is an unmet need to increase our understanding of these negative-regulative mechanisms against HSPCs to increase their efficiency during injury. Currently, HSPCs are being used to treat blood-related diseases such as leukemia and sickle cell disease. Identifying what mechanisms could be reducing HSPC efficacy in these therapies could provide novel targets to increase HSPC efficiency to regenerative various tissue injuries.\n\nDr. Racioppi and colleagues have identified a novel kinase target in HSPCs that could increase their survival and regenerative potential. This is intended to be used a new therapeutic strategy for treating tissue injury. Compared to a control, animals deficient in CaMKK2 showed increased regeneration after injury. Furthermore, Dr. Racioppi and colleagues showed that using a kinase-specific small molecule inhibitor in animal models after injury had increased survival and hematopoietic induced regeneration.\n\nAdvantages:\n* A first-in-class approach to promoting hematopoietic recovery after bone marrow injury\n* Enhanced recovery with CaMKK2 small molecule inhibitor demonstrated in mouse models",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Ultrasound imaging is widely used for medical diagnostics and to guide and inform other medical procedures. While conventional B-Mode and harmonic ultrasound imaging are low-energy modes, some ultrasound imaging techniques, such as Acoustic Force Radiation (ARFI) and Shear Wave Elastography (SWEI), use high energy ultrasound pulses to generate movement of tissue. When operating in such high energy modes and/or in situations when tissue is in motion, as in the case of cardio-sonography, it would be advantageous to optimize the acquisition time and the position of the ultrasound transducer to increase the image quality and to reduce the patient acoustic energy exposure. However, searching for optimized parameters to perform efficient scans takes significant time even for an experienced sonographer. In addition, simultaneous positioning of ultrasound transducer and operating the control panel while searching for optimal parameters can be ergonomically taxing. The lab of Gregg Trahey has developed a method that enables automated triggering of ultrasound image acquisition when conditions are most favorable. This technology is intended to be used by sonographers to collect quality images in less time. The method uses parameters including novel statistical correlators such as Lag-One Coherence derived from low-energy ultrasound image sets to adaptively adjust, in real- or near-real-time, the parameters and timing for a high energy ultra- sound acquisition. This allows detection imaging to automatically trigger acquisition at a moment and tissue position when degrading effects are likely to be minimized. This method was tested clinically in triggering real-time cardiac ARFI imaging, where statistical models of cardiac motion were combined with B-Mode imaging-derived parameters to acquire ARFI datasets when motion and clutter are transiently minimized. Advantages include potentially decreasing patient acoustic energy exposure and saving sonographers time, allowing for automatic image acquisition triggering with optimal parameters, and being clinically tested in transthoracic cardiac imaging.",

    "ip_description": "Wireless transmission of many types of sensitive data to be transmitted wirelessly creates a problem of security with respect to access to that information. This is particularly important when the transmitted data includes HIPAA-protected medical data, bank data, military drone technology and military data. As an example of compromised security, Predator military drones have reportedly been hacked. The creation of unbreakable encryption technology is thus vital to protect sensitive data. Quantum cryptography has been determined to be an unbreakable encryption technology, when properly implemented. Quantum cryptography has thus far seen a number of demonstrations, either using a fiber optic channel. or using a free-space optical channel. Unfornately, the drawback is that the sending and receiving nodes are fixed, and generally not particularly portable. This is fine if there are already optical fibers in place, but in many cases that would not be the situation. Hence, all secure communications links that have been demonstrated have required that either a free-space link or a fiber link exist either between two nodes or between both of the nodes and a common relay. Methods for overcoming that limitation would be of great value. A new invention directed toward solving the problem of creating an unbreakable encryption technology where the spatial relationship between two or more parties is reconfigurable. It is a system, and methods, for transmitting quantum states between a first node and a second node, or among more than two nodes. Each node is characterized by an instantaneous spatial position, and the instantaneous spatial position of the second node is repositionable within a frame of reference associated with the first node. A hovering drone is adapted either for running a quantum key transmission protocol in secure communication with the first node, and/or for running a quantum key reception protocol in secure communication with the second node. Either drone may serve as a relay of optical data between a base station and another drone. Secure communication among more than two nodes may be reconfigured.

Lithotripters provide an advantage over surgical means by allowing for stones to be broken into smaller pieces and pass into urine. Lithotripters with broader bean sizes have been shown to be better for stone fragmentation which can be attributed to several factors, including difficulty in stone alignment with the beam in more narrow beam devices. Thus, broadening of the transverse beam can benefit stone fragmentation efficiency. However, beam width is severely limited by the simultaneous increase in the longitudinal beam size as well as in clinical side effects since the longitudinal beam determines pressure and amplitude at the patient\u2019s flank and correlates with discomfort and skin lesions at the shock wave entrance/exit sites. No practical methods have been developed to solve this problem up to now.\n\nThis invention is design and methods to produce a steerable and nonaxisymmetric focused pressure field in a shock wave lithotripter. This is achieved by providing an acoustic barrier which can selectively block a portion of the shock wave generated by the shock wave source such that the substantially axisymmetric pressure field is transformed into a modified acoustic pressure field.\n\nAdvantages:\n* This new and unique characteristic in a shock wave lithotripter can be used to improve stone fragmentation while reducing tissue injury at the shock wave entry/exit site.\n* This invention allows for enlargement of the effective transverse beam size without increasing the longitudinal beam size.",

Studies indicate that postoperative AF is associated with an increased incidence of congestive heart failure, myocardial infraction, renal insufficiency and neurological events, resulting in longer hospital stay and increased total cost of surgery. The additional healthcare costs related to postoperative AF exceed $10,000 per patient, translating to more than $1 billion each year in the United States alone. Use of beta-blockers is a main way of prevention and treatment of postoperative AF. However, approximately 20% of patients undergoing CABG surgery develop postoperative AF despite the beta-blockers use. This calls for a need for identification the causes of increased risk for such altered beta-blocker effectiveness and methods for personalized treatment of patients with increased risk.\n\nDuke researchers discovered four particular alleles of DNA polymorphisms that are associated with an increased risk of altered effectiveness of beta blocker therapy. They developed a method and a DNA test kit for screening patients for these polymorphisms prior to CABG surgery. Identification of the increased risk will allow to prevent postoperative AF and to offer these patients personalized strategies or alternative treatment options.

    "ip_description": "Immunization with vaccines prevent illness, disability, and currently avert an estimated 2 to 3 million deaths every year. However, commonly-used vaccine technology platforms can be unpredictable, require a high manufacturing cost, and often need cold-chain storage. While these factors result in raised costs and less effective vaccinations, they also contribute to difficulties in access for developing nations. Peptide vaccines can answer many of these problems, but traditionally elicit a weak immune response. Additionally, common needle-based injections are costly, require skillful administration and waste management, and pose significant safety risks to both health workers and patients. The World Health Organization has estimated that over a million deaths occur each year due to needle cross-contamination. Needles are also a major psychological deterrent for many, with up to ten percent of patients admitting skipping flu shots due to fear of pain and injury during injection. There is a need for cheaper, more accessible vaccines that can be administered without needles.\n\nThe Collier lab at Duke has discovered that self-assembling peptide nanofibers can be rendered highly immunogenic by conjugating the assemblies to low molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG).

    "ip_description": "Recombinant biopolymers are used for a diverse array of applications including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and clinical diagnostics. Peptide polymers are particularly attractive candidates for biomedical applications because of their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and precisely specified, genetically encoded sequence. However, compared to their synthetic counterparts, recombinant peptide polymers are made up of a limited number of building blocks - the twenty standard amino acids - which severely restricts their potential design space. Nature itself has evolved numerous strategies to diversify the proteome through post-translational modifications (PTMs), but these are inaccessible with commonly used prokaryote systems. There is a need to diversify the peptide polymers available for creating biopolymers that still maintain a simple recombinant synthesis workflow. This technology is valuable for recombinant synthesis of protein nanoparticles with a lipid core.\n\nDuke inventors have reported a nanoparticle drug delivery system that would be particularly useful for hydrophobic small molecules without a handle for conjugation. This is a self-assembled micelle comprising a fatty acid conjugated to an unstructured polypeptide. Inspired by biohybrid molecules that are synthesized in nature through post\u2010translational modifications (PTM), the inventors have exploited a eukaryotic PTM to recombinantly synthesize lipid\u2013polypeptide hybrid materials. By co\u2010expressing yeast N\u2010myristoyltransferase with an elastin\u2010like polypeptide (ELP) fused to a short recognition sequence in E. coli, they show robust and high\u2010yield modification of the ELP with myristic acid. ELPs exhibit lower critical solution temperature phase behavior, enabling them to form gel-like depots that increase the half-life of their cargo. The ELP's reversible phase behavior is retained upon myristoylation and can be tuned to span a 30\u201360\u2009\u00b0C. Myristoylated ELPs provide a versatile platform for genetically pre\u2010programming self\u2010assembly into micelles of varied size and shape. Their lipid cores can be loaded with hydrophobic small molecules by passive diffusion. Cellular studies and mouse models demonstrated improved efficacy and antitumor effects.\n\nWhile the inventors have completed studies related to drug delivery applications, this technology could be used to encapsulate other hydrophobic molecules such as imaging agents. The invention can also be expanded to polypeptides other than ELPs.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Offers a novel class of hybrid material that can encapsulate any hydrophobic small molecule, including those without a chemical handle for conjugation\n* Longer plasma circulation than free drug upon intravenous injection demonstrated in mice\n* ELPs are thermally responsive biopolymers that undergo an inverse phase transition, which results in thermal targeting of tumors\n* Physically encapsulated doxorubicin and paclitaxel exhibit cytotoxic effects on 4T1 and PC3\u2010luc cells",

While the delivery of hydrophobic drugs remains the most common target when designing nanoparticles, hydrophilic drugs also suffer from rapid renal clearance and premature _in vivo_ degradation. Because of these limitations, multiple high\u2010dose injections of hydrophilic chemotherapeutics are necessary to attain a therapeutically relevant concentration in a tumor, but the maximum dose is limited by systemic side effects to healthy organs. Hence, better methods to deliver hydrophilic chemotherapeutics are needed. Duke inventors have reported a nanoparticle drug delivery system intended to improve the therapeutic efficacy of hydrophilic chemotherapeutics.

Treatments include therapy with botulinum neurotoxin to induce paralysis or deep brain stimulation. Not only are these modalities invasive, they do not target the root cause of the disease and can only help reduce the symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent demand for disease-modifying treatments for dystonia; however, this has historically been a challenge, given that these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Dr. Nicole Calakos, a neurobiologist at Duke University, and colleagues have recently implicated the eIF2-alpha pathway in dystonic cells carrying the common GAG deletion within the TOR1A gene. Dr. Calakos et al. have demonstrated that therapeutically modulating the eIF2-alpha pathway helps restore several aberrancies associated with dystonic cells and improves survival in a dystonia mouse model. Importantly, these therapies can be administered in a minimally-invasive manner, making them an appealing alternative to most current therapies for dystonia. These findings having encouraging implications for the treatment of dystonia and may help target the underlying mechanisms involved in this pathology.

    "ip_description": "Mammals are capable of detecting and recognizing a large number of odors. Olfactory receptors (ORs) play a crucial role in detecting and recognizing odorant molecules. There has been growing interest in elucidating the patterns of odorant-ORs interaction fueled by their potential to be utilized in various fields including industrial monitoring, clinical diagnosis, environmental protection, food safety and national security. Conventional in vitro systems used to identify odorants are in liquid phase, which limits their applicability. This is very distinct from the physiological conditions where odorant molecules reach the olfactory epithelium in vapor phase and activate ORs by dissolution into the nasal mucosa. Therefore, there is an ongoing need to develop methods of volatile odor detection that better mimic the olfactory system to operate in more realistic settings.\n\nResearchers at Duke University have developed a platform for detecting and discriminating odorants of interest presented in vapor phase. This is intended to detect specific volatiles for fields such as the fragrance industry, explosives and illegal drug detection, diagnostics, and malodor control. In addition, this system permits to discriminate specific patterns of chemical mixtures associated with diseases such as microbial infections. The cell-based platform enables the identification of the best combinations of olfactory receptors to detect and discriminate targeted odorants among structurally related chemicals. Real-time monitoring is accomplished using the Glosensor assay, a luminescence assay previously used with liquid odorant stimulation. This technology has been demonstrated in the lab to detect small differences in chemical structures, and it permits the reliable discrimination of individual odorants even when present in complex mixtures, when used with highly selective olfactory receptors. Alternatively, activation patterns of a panel of broadly tuned olfactory receptors can be used to discriminate differences in chemical compositions of complex mixtures.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Detects volatile odorants in real time\n* Can discriminate between structurally analogous odorants\n* Better mimics the olfactory system in the heterologous cells",

The trion, a three-body charge-exciton bound state, offers unique opportunities to simultaneously manipulate charge, spin, and excitation in one-dimensional single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) at room temperature. Effective exploitation of trion quasi-particles requires fundamental insight into their creation and decay dynamics. Such knowledge, however, remains elusive for single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) trion states, due to the electronic and morphological heterogeneity of commonly interrogated SWNT samples, and the fact that transient spectroscopic signals uniquely associated with the trion state have not been identified.\n\nDuke inventors have reported an optoelectronic system intended for use with SWNT based optoelectronic devices, including photovoltaics, photodetectors, and spintronics. The technology describes length-sorted SWNTs and precisely control charge-carrier-doping densities to determine trion dynamics using femtosecond pump\u2013probe spectroscopy. Identification of the trion transient absorptive hallmark enables us to demonstrate that trions (i) derive from a precursor excitonic state, (ii) are produced via migration of excitons to stationary hole-polaron sites, and (iii) decay in a first-order manner. Importantly, under appropriate carrier-doping densities, exciton-to-trion conversion in SWNTs can approach 100% at ambient temperature.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Provides control of trion density in carbon nanotubes\n- The trion offers unique opportunities to simultaneously manipulate charge, spin and excitation in 1D SWNTs at room temperature\n- This information can be manipulated for exploiting SWNTs in photon sensing, photovoltaic, and many other optoelectronic applications",

To enable higher spatial resolution required in studies of detailed brain microstructures and related functions, multi-shot acquisition strategies are used. However, multi-shot diffusion-weighted imaging is susceptible to motion-induced phase errors that can be mitigated using navigator echoes, but at the expense of imaging throughput.

    "ip_description": "Glioblastomas (GBMs) are among the most common and deadly malignant brain tumors with a mean survival time of approximately 14-15 months following diagnosis. Current treatments for GBMs include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, however, survival remains low. Immunotherapy, which has proven successful for the treatment of other cancers, is an emerging field that may be a promising treatment for GBMs. However, treating GBMs remains challenging due to the immunosuppressive nature of GMBs. Treatment is further complicated by T-cell lymphopaenia (low number of circulating T-cells) in many patients. Previously, it has been shown that T-cell sequestration in the bone marrow of GBM patients is due do loss of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1), a G-protein coupled receptor, on the surface of T-cells. Introduction of a cell surface stable S1P1 leads to freeing of T-cells from bone marrow and licenses T-cell activating immunotherapies that were previously ineffective. However, there are currently no direct pharmacological methods available to increase S1P1 cell surface expression.\n\nThis invention is a method for increasing S1P1 cell surface expression on T-cells through genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of beta-arrestins. Beta-arrestins are required for internalization of G-protein coupled receptors including S1P1.

Accordingly, computed tomography scanners are the first choice for the diagnosis of cardiac complications, oncological problems and trauma patients. The main shortcoming of CT scans remains patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Several approaches have been used to reduce radiation exposure during CT scans. However, there is ongoing need to provide accurate patient radiation dose estimates while also maintaining high-quality images. Organ dose is generally regarded as one of the best to reflect patient radiation load and depends on two main factors, namely patient anatomy and irradiation field. Accordingly, effective modeling of both factors is required for an accurate estimation of organ dose.\n\nThe inventors at Duke developed a new method for esimating patient radiation dose during CT scans. A clinical patient is matched with a corresponding computational phantom to obtain a representation of patient anatomy.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "One of the most challenging experiences in photography is taking images in low-light environments. The basic principle of photography is the accumulation of photons in the sensor during a given exposure time. In general, the more photons reach the surface of the sensor the better quality of the final image, as the photonic noise is reduced. However, this basic principle requires the photographed scene to be static and that there is no relative motion between the camera and the scene. Otherwise, the photons will be accumulated in neighboring pixels, generating a loss of sharpness (blur). This problem is significant when shooting with hand-held cameras, the most popular photography device today, in dim light conditions. Current cameras including those found in camera phones are designed to take a burst of images. This has been exploited in several approaches for accumulating photons in the different images and then forming an image with less noise. However, this principle is disturbed if the images in the burst are blurred. The classical mathematical formulation of this problem as a multi-image deconvolution, seeks to solve an inverse problem where the unknowns are the multiple blurring operators and the underlying sharp image. This procedure is computationally very expensive (prohibiting its on-camera implementation), and very sensitive to a good estimation of the blurring kernels. Furthermore, since the inverse problem is ill-posed it relies on priors either or both for the calculus of the blurs and the latent sharp image.\n\nDuke inventors report a method for automatically removing the blur and noise of images intended to be implemented in cameras, camera phones, or photo-editing software. If the photographer takes a burst of images, a modality available in virtually all modern digital cameras, this invention combines them to generate a clean, sharp version. This is done without explicitly solving any blur estimation and subsequent inverse problem. The proposed algorithm is strikingly simple: it performs a weighted average in the Fourier domain, with weights depending on the Fourier spectrum magnitude. The method can be seen as a generalization of the align and average procedure, with a weighted average, motivated by hand-shake physiology and theoretically supported, taking place in the Fourier domain. The method's rationale is that camera shake has a random nature, and therefore, each image in the burst is generally blurred differently. Experiments with real camera data, and extensive comparisons, show that the proposed Fourier burst accumulation algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results an order of magnitude faster, with simplicity for on-board implementation on camera phones. The inventors have demonstrated experiments in real high dynamic range (HDR) scenes, showing how the method can be straightforwardly extended to HDR photography.\n\nAdvantages:\n* A simple method for generating crisp images using digital cameras, including phone cameras\n* Can be easily implemented with any camera capable of taking burst photos\n* Technology has been reduced to practice",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Flash memory is an extremely popular non-volatile memory technology. It is used in a wide range of devices, including USB memory sticks, smartphones, embedded sensors, and solid state disks (SSDs). In particular, SSDs have been gaining ground for replacing hard disk drives (HDDs) as the storage medium of choice for both consumer and enterprise applications. Flash SSDs are popular because of their speed, reliability, and availability. However, a major drawback of Flash is wearout, referring to the fact that Flash cells can only support a limited number of erases before they fail. This shortcoming can be magnified by patterns of writing data that concentrate writes and erases on a small number of cells in a given device. Accordingly, extending the operating life of Flash memory is an area of ongoing research. In particular, Flash lifetime extension is critical for applications where servicing or replacing the device is costly (e.g., in large datacenters or smartphones) or impractical (e.g., space probes and embedded sensors).\n\nDuke researchers have reported a novel method to dramatically extend the lifetime of Flash memory intended to help all potential and current users of Flash, including datacenters. This invention increases the number of writes to a page of non-volatile memory before the page must be erased. Instead of writing a dataword directly to memory, a codeword is written to the memory location. The key innovation is using a coset code that provides flexibility in choosing which codeword to write; that is, every dataword has multiple codewords that are valid representatives of it. This flexibility enables choosing codewords so as to enable a page to be rewritten multiple times before each erase and to maximize the spread of wear across memory cells. The coset coding is also integrated with error correction encoding. This extends the life of the Flash memory and decreases the likelihood of degradation which could lead to errors and system failure. It is shown that lifetime gains of over 500% are possible with only modest encoding and decoding complexity. These methods and techniques can be carried out in any system in order to extend the lifetime of the Flash memory.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Flash lifetime gains of over 500%\n- This invention can be carried out in any system",

    "ip_description": "The tobacco smoking rate among adults diagnosed with serious mental illness (SMI), such as schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar, and recurring depressive disorders, is 3 to 4 times the rate of the general population. People with serious mental illness consume about half of the cigarettes sold in the United States. These high smoking rates have serious health consequences for this population, including a higher incidence of cancer and 25 years of reduced life expectancy. Lower cost and higher reach smoking cessation interventions are needed to address this problem. Digital technology may help address the treatment needs of people with SMI. The digital therapeutics global market was $1.2 million in 2018 and is anticipated to be about $8.6 million by the year 2025. Digital interventions can be standardized to provide evidence-based content, accessed from many locations at any time, tailored to specific groups, and implemented at a lower cost than traditional psychosocial interventions. Furthermore, two recent studies indicate that 72%-81% of individuals with SMI have a mobile device, suggesting that wide dissemination of smartphone-based interventions is possible. Digital interventions for the general population exist, including the QuitGuide app developed by the National Cancer Institute. However, there is a great need to develop tailored smoking cessation interventions that can be widely disseminated in the severe mental illness population.\n\nDuke researchers have developed a mobile application called Learn to Quit (LTQ) to teach patients with severe mental illness the skills to quit smoking. LTQ incorporates the following design features to address usability barriers among people with SMI: (a) simple screens, large buttons, and a predictable app structure; (b) gamification of smoking cessation content; (c) use of behavioral principles to enhance retention and comprehension of content; (d) emphasis in visual engagement and storytelling; and (e) access to technical coaching. A phase 1b study intended to refine core elements of the studied intervention in a real-world setting has been completed with strong evidence of LTQ\u2019s usability, feasibility, and safety.

    "ip_description": "Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are the most common primary skin lymphomas, and clinically, about 90% of CTCL patients suffer from severe chronic itch. This significantly impacts patients' emotional, functional, and psychological well-being. In patients with lymphomas, pruritus is frequent, severe, and unrelieved by emollients, topical steroids, or oral antihistamines. Thus, there is an urgent demand for the development of new anti-itch therapeutics. Researchers at Duke and UNC have identified a new method for treating chronic itch after lymphoma intended to treat CTCL patients. This is accomplished by targeting microRNA-711 and its interaction with TRPA1 ion channel. Disruption of the microRNA-711 and TRPA1 ion channel interaction with a blocking peptide alleviates chronic itch. This technology was demonstrated in mouse models. Patients with chronic itch from other conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, viral infections, and opioid treatments may also benefit from this discovery. Advantages include identifying microRNA-711 inhibitors as a new anti-itch treatment strategy for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patients, offering effective and safer therapies for lymphoma-associated chronic itch, and potentially being a treatment strategy for other sources of chronic itch.",

    "ip_description": "Chronic pain is a major health problem that affects approximately 1.5 billion people worldwide. The annual economic cost of chronic pain in the United States, including both treatment and lost productivity is estimated at $635 billion. Current non-opioids treatments are partially effective, while opioids are habit-forming, especially with long-term use. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for effective and safe pain medicine. Dr. Ru-Rong Ji and colleagues have reported a method for treating pain intended to help treat inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain, and cancer pain. They have uncovered programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) as an endogenous inhibitor of acute and chronic pain. The checkpoint inhibitory protein PD-L1 inhibited acute inflammatory pain. Furthermore, PD-L1 reduced chronic pain effectively, including nerve-injury-induced neuropathic pain and bone cancer pain in rodents, via both peripheral and central actions. PD-L1 is produced not only by cancer cells but also by non-malignant tissues such as skin, dorsal root ganglion neurons, and spinal cord. Given the high potency of PD-L1 in suppressing pain, local targeting of PD-L1 signaling axis in sensory neurons may lead to the development of new analgesics. This invention was demonstrated in mouse models. The invention can also be used as a diagnostic tool to help predict the efficacy of immunotherapies in patients by performing a quantitative sensory test immediately after administration of a therapeutic capable of suppressing PD-1 -associated nociceptive neuron activity. This was demonstrated in melanoma-bearing mice studies. Advantages include a new therapeutic target for pain that provides an alternative to opioids, the same target can be used to assess the efficacy of immunotherapies by measuring changes in pain levels, and the invention has been demonstrated in animal models.",

    "ip_description": "The accuracy and precision of many therapeutic imaging interventions is challenged by respiratory motion. Ventilation-induced tumor and organ-at-risk oscillations are of concern primarily for imaging lung and upper abdominal malignancies. Four dimensional (4D) computerized tomography (CT) is currently the most widely adopted modality for imaging organs that are subject to respiratory motion. However, the mechanical design of CT scanners limits the sampling pattern and often leads to resampling artifacts. This modality also provides poor soft tissue contrast. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide improved soft tissue contrast relative to CT. Further, the sampling function of an MR imager can be easily modified and adapted to, e.g., facilitate imaging of particular portions of anatomy, to detect a flow tensor or other specialized properties of tissue, to emphasize imaging of certain types of tissue or contrast agents, or to provide some other benefit. However, MRI can impose strict timing requirements when imaging tissue, requiring extensive time for acquisition and/or numerous MR scans to generate an adequate image of tissue. These factors have limited application of MRI to the imaging of tissues that are in motion, for example, the lungs, heart, and other tissues of the abdominal and/or thoracic cavities during respiration.\n\nInventors at Duke have developed methods for high spatiotemporal resolution for a family of 4D-MRI pulse sequences by measuring respiratory-induced motion. This invention is intended to improve the imaging of abdominothoracic organs, tumors, or other biological tissues while compensating for respiratory-induced motion. The use of a quasi\u2010random sampling function and view\u2010sharing driven by the average breathing curve provide a feasible method for self\u2010sorted 4D MRI at reduced acquisition times. This approach allows for the extent of data sharing to be inversely proportional to the average breathing motion hence improving resolution and decreasing artifact levels. The sampling and reconstruction technique were tested and validated in simulation, dynamic phantom, animal, and human studies with varying breathing periods/amplitudes.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Can measure respiratory motion faster than any known 4D MRI method without compromising spatial resolution and coverage\n* Provides the highest coverage and spatial resolution for a given total scan time\n* Soft-tissue contrast is achieved without the use of ionizing radiation\n* The availability of pulse\u00ads-sequences exploiting various contrast mechanisms inherent in living tissue, will make the proposed method a valuable addition to treatment planning.",

However, the essence of conventional image and video compression algorithms has not changed substantially over the last two decades. Although these techniques have been very well engineered and precisely tuned, they exist in a conventional, hard-coded framework and the result has been diminishing returns with each generation of a new compression standard. On the other hand, machine-learning-based techniques offer an adaptive approach that can meet the needs of growing array of video use cases such as VR streaming, social media sharing and object detection.

    "ip_description": "Current gene therapy approaches based upon targeted DNA endoculeases, such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), are based upon custom built DNA binding domains. Although gene therapy with ZFNs has progressed through clinical trials in several cases, they are only capable of targeting a single locus and are known to have low specificity. These technologies are unwieldy, difficult to execute, and are only capable of single target site cleavage. To target multiple DNA targets simultaneously, bacterial type II CRISPR/Cas9-based RNA-guided DNA endonucleases (RGNs) can be employed. These RGNs consist minimally of a Cas9 endonuclease loaded with a single guide RNA that is fully complementary to the desired DNA target sequence. In contrast to other targeted nucleases using custom engineered DNA binding domains designed to target a unique sequence, Cas9 proteins can be retargeted simply by expression of a distinct guide RNA. However, the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 RGN (SPCas9) greatly exceeds the packaging limit of \u02dc4.8 kb for adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vectors, which are currently the preferred gene delivery vectors for in vivo purposes. There is a need for smaller Cas9 proteins to be developed.\n\nDuke inventors have reported materials that incorporate novel Cas9 variants isolated from distinct bacterial species which exhibit similar specificity and efficiency to _S. pyogenes_ Cas9, but are ~25% smaller at only ~3.2 kb in size. This invention is intended to treat viral infections or viral induced cancer. This enables the expression of these Cas9 variants from AAV vectors - which have a limited packaging capacity \u2013 while retaining over 1 kb in packaging space to incorporate sgRNA expression constructs. Additionally, this invention comprises a novel method for expressing sgRNAs using an alternative promoter and fusion-transcript system, reducing the space requirement from ~450 bp down to ~220 bp \u2013 a reduction of over 50%. The reported compositions solve the problem of low specificity by providing multiplex targeting to greatly extend editing efficiency beyond what is possible using ZFNs to permit not only gene disruption but also full gene deletion. In the context of virus-infected target cells, gene deletion could also be used for removal of a viral receptor or essential co-factor, rendering those cells refractory to infection. There are numerous tissues that are difficult to transduce where AAV is the sole capable option. It is in these tissues where CRISPR/Cas9/AAV will open up new gene therapy potentialities as an antiviral treatment option. This space-saving system has been demonstrated to perform similarly to standard CRISPR/Cas9 in _in vitro_ assays in human cell lines and, as an antiviral therapeutic, reduces HBV viral loads and HPV-associated cancer progression in corresponding mouse models.\n\nThis invention potentially represents a \u201cplatform\u201d technology on which a variety of genome engineering/gene therapy approaches may be based.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Provides a tremendous improvement in CRISPR/Cas9 by enabling expression from a single, safe and effective AAV vector\n*   Ability to express Cas9 and up to 5 sgRNAs from a single AAV, enabling simultaneous targeting of multiple sequences\n*   Overcomes the package size limitations of the AAV vectors by using the smaller Neisseria promoters\n*   Proof of concept studies have been successfully demonstrated with hepatitis B virus\n*   Has been patented for the removal of latent viral genomes (i.e. hepatitis B virus, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus) from infected cells, and could represent a potential cure for these otherwise lifelong diseases",

    "ip_description": "The ability to non-invasively image the molecular composition of an object is desirable in a number of application areas such as medical imaging, security, structural integrity verification, and homeland defense. While x-ray imaging is the most effective strategy for tomographic imaging in such applications, conventional x-ray systems are not sensitive to molecular composition. Also, scanning x-ray systems capture only a small fraction of the radiation directed at the scanned object and are, therefore, highly inefficient. As a result, they require either x-ray sources capable of high power to increase the available radiation at the detector or long exposure times. In either case, this exposes the scanned object to excessive amounts of x-ray radiation, which can be undesirable in many applications. There remains a need for an improved imaging system that noninvasively ascertains the structural and molecular composition of three-dimensional objects at high speed and with relatively lower cost and complexity.\n\nInventors at Duke University have developed a novel system for noninvasively ascertaining the molecular composition of three-dimensional objects. This technology is intended to be used for applications including luggage scanning, cargo inspection, explosives detection, and medical imaging. Specifically, this technology can simultaneously image the structure and composition of objects based on measurements of the low-angle x-ray diffraction properties. This is achieved through the use of a coded aperture that encodes spatial and spectral features onto radiation scattered from image points within the object. In addition, multiple x-ray projections can be made simultaneously instead of sequentially as in conventional computed tomography (CT) systems. The coded aperture acts as a reference structure which disambiguates these superposed projections. By using decompressive inference, the number of images required for a 3D reconstruction is reduced. This approach enables snapshot operation, which opens possibilities for video-rate x-ray imaging.

    "ip_description": "Globally, prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of new cancer cases in men and the sixth-leading cause of cancer-related death in men. Prostate-related health issues are on the rise, and the number of cancer cases is increasing, leading to the need for improved treatments and diagnostic technologies. While 80% of patients with prostate cancer respond favorably to androgen ablation therapy through surgical or medical castration, most patients experience a relapse of the disease within 1-2 years. The use of chemotherapies have improved treatment in these metastatic castration resistant prostate cancers (mCRPCs), but off-target activities of these drugs have necessitated the search for novel and selective drugs for mCRPC. Although copper (Cu) has long been recognized as a factor in cancer cell proliferation, approaches to date do not optimally exploit this aspect for clinical effect. A drug that could manipulate the Cu biology of these cells would be a potent therapeutic for mCRPC and enter a growing global prostate cancer therapeutic market. Furthermore, a drug that is activated only in mCRPC tissue would elude off-target activity and side reactions. Dr. Katherine Franz and coworkers have demonstrated a method of directing the cytotoxicity of copper dithiocarbamates against prostate cancer cells. In order to accomplish this, the copper-chelating characteristics of an approved drug for alcohol aversion therapy (disulfiram) is repurposed to achieve copper-assisted toxicity. A prochelator-approach leveraging a cancer-specific activation mechanism creates conditions for a selective prostate cancer treatment. This strategy is particularly effective due to the increased copper uptake observed in prostate cancer cells. Advantages include a new strategy to leverage amplified copper metabolism of prostate cancer, potentially minimizing side reactions and off-target pathways that impede disulfiram\u2019s anticancer potential, and a versatile synthetic strategy that could be readily modified to target different cancers or diseases.",

    "ip_description": "Training is widely accepted as a method to improve one\u2019s performance in sports. However, athletes typically have to rely on experience, heuristics, and rough approximations to design their training routines. Despite tremendous advances in sensor technology, computational methods and the science of physiology, athletic training software remain grounded in outdated science or conventional wisdom. While several dynamic approaches have been proposed to model the response of the human body to physical training, they rely on linear assumptions and fail to account for physiological phenomena such as performance saturation (diminishing returns) and over-training. Moreover, many of them rely on population-based statistical assumptions rather than personal physiology and fitness of humans. There is an opportunity, therefore, for an accurate physiological model and heuristic algorithm to help optimize training routines for athletes, recovering patients, and fitness enthusiast. The current models available for predicting performance as a function of training have significant predictive limitations. A more sophisticated model is needed to improve performance predictions and design optimal training strategies. Duke inventors have reported a new mathematical model and heuristic algorithm for athletic performance intended to be implemented with existing physiological data collection technologies to help optimize training for athletes and individuals rehabilitating from injuries. The mathematical model incorporates nonlinear aspects of human physiology, which allows representation of the dynamics of fitness adaptations and the onset of fatigue with a significantly more sophisticated approach. This invention can predict athletic performance based on training inputs. The model accounts for well-known physiological phenomena such as the concepts of saturation (diminishing returns) and over-training which are currently not accounted for in other athletic performance models. This invention may also utilize a dynamical systems model of oxygen uptake to distinguish between aerobic and anaerobic training loads. The inventors have successfully predicted athletic performance in several pilot studies using this technology. Advantages include: Can be used to predict athletic performance and also to optimize training strategies that are personalized for a given athlete based on their individual physiology, fitness, athletic/rehabilitation goals, and constraints; Accounts for the personal physiological and fitness of an individual using their physiology, fitness, athletic/rehabilitation goals, and constraints rather than relying on population-based statistical assumptions; Can more accurately predict the separate adaptations of the aerobic and anaerobic body systems in response to exercise; Has immediate applications for the health and fitness communities and is easily implementable with existing physiological data collection technologies.",

Accordingly, there is a great need to dissect the precise mechanisms of the antitumor mechanisms of action of trastuzumab in order to improve outcomes in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Researchers at Duke have identified a novel strategy to overcome resistant to anti-HER2 therapy utilizing macrophage checkpoint blockade.

Despite the best efforts to maintain sterility, surgical site infection occurs in up to 30% of surgery patients in the United States. One of the tools used in an attempt to decrease surgical site infections is the surgical drain. The goal of a surgical drain is to promote healthy wound healing, reduce pain, and prevent infection by allowing the fluid which collects in the wound bed after surgery to leave the body. Annually used by over 5 million US patients, these surgical drains are known to increase the risk of infection the longer they remain in the body by providing a path for bacteria to enter the body. For instance, SSI rates after breast reconstruction are reported to be as high as 26% and the risk increases to more than three times with the use of surgical drains. Although there are multiple kinds of drains available on the market today, there is still a great deal of room for improvement. Therefore a new design to reduce the rate of infection by preventing bacterial colonization inside the surgical drain is needed.\n\nDuke inventors have designed a sterilization device for surgical drains to prevent SSI. The device consists of a container which can encase the surgical drain evacuator bulbs and an ultraviolet (UV) radiation source. Patients or caregivers can place the evacuator bulbs into the device and turn on UV. UV radiation can kill 99.9% of bacteria at 5 seconds and 100% at 90 seconds. With this device, bacteria in the drains can be effectively eliminated and SSI can be prevented. In addition this sterilization device can be designed to fit various kinds of surgical drains on the market.

The invention greatly simplifies the operation of an MRI scanner by automatically setting the timing parameter 'inversion time' (TI), which currently needs to be manually set by the scanner operator. This automation is applicable to all pulse sequences that employ an inversion-recovery pulse. Such sequences require the TI parameter to be set so that a region of tissue can be selectively suppressed, or 'nulled'. This disclosure employs myocardial delayed enhancement imaging in the presence of a T1-shortening contrast agent, with viable myocardium is the tissue to be nulled. This technique can be expanded to any region of the body and any conditioning prior to the inversion pulse. The current technique requires finding the optimal TI manually, which can be challenging and time-consuming. Following contrast administration the T1 of blood and tissue is changing as the agent is removed from the blood. therefore, the TI needs to be constantly re-adjusted to obtain the optimal image contrast. In viability imaging, differences in contrast delineate regions of myocardial damage, so improper selection of inversion times could lead to incorrect depiction of damaged tissue which could lead to missed abnormalities or wrong diagnoses. The invention solves this problem by automatic TI adjustment consisting of 1) acquisition of a single data line at a predetermined location, 2) calculation of pixel T1 values along the line, 3) compartment localization along the single line based on T1, 4) calculation of TI, and 5) setting the TI parameter for the subsequent imaging sequence. This is accomplished by a) applying a non-selective IR pulse and acquiring a single line of data repeatedly at specific times relative to the IR pulse, b) calculating the T1 values of each pixel along the line based on data in (a), c) detecting the compartment of interest to be nulled, d) calculating the inversion time to be used for the following imaging sequence.",

Inventors at Duke University have developed a novel mammalian model system comprising a conditional disruption of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAchT). The resulting reduction in VAchT trafficking to synaptic secretory vesicles results in reliable, measurable impairments in object and social recognition, neuromuscular performance, and autonomic nervous system function. Accordingly, the mammalian model system can be coupled with established assays and used to screen candidate compounds and treatment options for the many disorders associated with acetylcholine transmission defects.

For these conditions, two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is established as an essential diagnostic tool. Current techniques in transesophageal scanning, though, are limited by incomplete visualization of cardiac structures in close proximity to the transducer. Thus, a new method and system which propose a 2D curvilinear array for 3D transesophageal echocardiography in order to widen the field of view and increase visualization close to the transducer face. In this project, a 440 channel 5 MHz two-dimensional array with a 12.6 mm aperture diameter on a flexible interconnect circuit has been molded to a 4 mm radius of curvature. A 75% element yield was achieved during fabrication and an average \u22126dB bandwidth of 30% was observed in pulse-echo tests. Using this transducer in conjunction with modifications to the beam former delay software and scan converter display software of the 3D scanner, cylindrical real-time curvilinear volumetric scans of tissue phantoms was obtained, including a field of view of greater than 120\u00b0 in the curved, azimuth direction and 65\u00b0 phased array sector scans in the elevation direction.

    "ip_description": "Despite the significant impact that the checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies have generated in clinical oncology, the majority of our cancer patients still do not benefit from this treatment modality. While the PD-1/PD-L1 system plays an important role in appropriate immune system down-regulation, it is often hijacked by cancer cells to prevent recognition and attack by the T-cell mediated immune response. The preferred route to address this problem is administration of anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies to cancer patients, an option that has gained renewed and intense focus in light of recent technological advancements in the immunotherapy field. Indeed, six anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies have already been FDA- approved to treat 14 different types of cancer and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are currently being evaluated in thousands of additional clinical trials. However, it is well documented that PD-1/PD-L1 antibody treatments are prone to failure due to adaptive resistance. Accordingly, there is a great need to dissect the precise mechanisms of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy-induced signaling pathways in order to identify targets that can be leveraged to prevent resistance against these treatments.\n\nDuke inventors have identified a novel pathway that significantly enhances responses to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. This technology uses NLRP3 inhibitors as a treatment strategy with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors to prevent adaptive resistance. Specifically, this is a newly identified mechanism whereby CD8+ T cell activation in response to PD-1 blockade induced a PD-L1-NLRP3 inflammasome signaling cascade that ultimately led to the recruitment of granulocytic myeloidderived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) into tumor tissues, thereby dampening the resulting antitumor immune response. The genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of NLRP3 suppressed PMNMDSC tumor infiltration and significantly augmented the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody immunotherapy. This technology has been demonstrated with several preclinical tumor models as well as clinical specimens.\n\nIn addition to improving oncology treatments, the inhibitors may also be used to prevent anti-PD-1 antibody induced autoimmune related side effects such as colitis. Apart from inhibiting the upstream activators, inhibitors of other members of the identified signaling axis may also be used in combination with anti-PD-1 / PD-L1 antibodies.\n\nAdvantages:\n* An identified pathway that represents a tumor-intrinsic adaptive resistance mechanism to anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy that is a promising target for future translational research\n* Inhibition of the upstream component of the signaling axis identified by the inventors will likely lead to higher specificity and lower toxicity\n* Inventors have identified all components of the singling axis, each of which can be targeted in a multi-pronged approach to prevent anti-PD-1 immunotherapy resistance",

There are currently no biomarkers that reliably predict which cancer patients will respond or be resistant to immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Clinically useful biomarkers capable of predicting which patients may respond to immunotherapy strategies would streamline treatment plans, thereby assigning more effective therapies to patients sooner while avoiding the use of costly therapies that will ultimately fail in the clinic.

Obesity is one of the main risk factors for heart disease, diabetes, liver or kidney disease, depression, etc. Despite these risk factors, it can be difficult and discouraging for individuals to seek help or find efficient tools to help them choose heathier food and meal options. In recent years, the increase of telemedicine has given individuals the opportunity to make better heath decisions all from their mobile or computer devices. However, not all of the nutrition software applications in the market provide a clear guide to a heathier lifestyle.\n\nTenekjian and colleagues have developed a web-based software application named RealChoices that will help people make better nutrition choices in their daily meals. Users will have the ability to prepare a week\u2019s worth of meals from a variety of established nutritious meals. What makes RealChoices stand out from other software applications will be the feature to have dietitian options and feedback on meals chosen by the user. It also allows for communication of the meal choices to catering staff to use for food purchase and meal preparation planning as well as serving of the specific meal to the specific client.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Helps prepare nutrition meals days in advance with a larger variety of pre-established meals and a la carte items\n* Provides feedback on meals from dietitians\n* Allows communication with catering staff for meal preparation planning",

    "ip_description": "With inexpensive wearable sensors, physiological data monitoring has extended beyond clinical anesthesia and emergency medicine and into in-home healthcare. Waveforms such as electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) contain valuable information about a patient\u2019s physiological state, however, current analysis tools which often includes simple visual inspection by a clinician fail to extract and utilize this information to the greatest possible extent. The current analysis tools of these physiological signals leave much room for improved physiological state monitoring and event detection all which can aid a clinician in providing the best possible care. This technology is a software that extracts and tracks over time the underlying physiological state that produces the observed physiological signal. This is intended to be implemented into physiological monitoring devices to assist clinicians, and applications including continuous patient monitoring, automated arrhythmia detection, and physiological data analysis and visualization. Using a wave shape model, this technology finds a low-dimensional representation of the observed data. In such a representation, physiological state is more easily visualized and anomalous events and long-term deterioration of a patient\u2019s state can be easily detected, something that has been a challenge for existing analysis tools. This technology has been demonstrated with arterial blood pressure signals and an electrocardiogram (ECG).

    "ip_description": "According to the CDC, each year 2.8 million people in the United States develop an antibiotic-resistant infection, leading to more than 35,000 deaths. Beta lactams were the largest segment in the antibiotics market in 2018 at $20.7 billion, however resistant bacteria often produce enzymes called beta-lactamases that hydrolyze these antibiotics and render them ineffective. In particular, the rise of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex has challenged clinicians in the prevention and treatment of a range of infections, including those of the skin and soft tissues, bloodstream, lungs, and urinary tract. The development of novel anti-infective molecules with new mechanisms of action is critical to addressing the antibiotic resistance problem. Metal chelators have demonstrated promise as antibacterial agents, but their overall toxicity has hindered their application thus far. Inventors at Duke have developed a compound intended to treat drug-resistant bacteria. This prodrug releases copper chelating agents in response to beta-lactamases produced by resistant bacteria, providing a targeted bacterial treatment strategy.

    "ip_description": "Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, can lead to severe complications and increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and death. About 1 out of 3 US adults, or about 75 million people have high blood pressure. Nitric oxide (NO) donors clinically used for vasodilation can effectively reduce blood pressure. However, neutral nitric oxide donors that are used for this indication are unstable and therefore have storage stability problems. As a result, their clinical utilities are limited to acute conditions such as acute myocardial infraction and congestive heart failure. A technology that can solve the storage stability problem of neutral nitric oxide donors need to be discovered in order to use NO for chronic conditions such as hypertension.\n\nTo overcome this current problem limiting the therapeutic use of neutral nitric oxide donors, Duke scientists have invented compounds that release neutral nitric oxide in a second order reaction. These compounds are storage stable and do not decompose to release nitric oxide over time or in light. When needed, activation of these compounds can trigger the release of nitric oxide. This stable shelf-life property will allow these compounds to be used in treating not only acute conditions but also chronic conditions such as hypertension and coronary artery disease. When tested on a patient with chronic hypertension, this compound could safely and effectively reduce the patient\u2019s blood pressure.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Neutral nitric oxide has been used commonly in clinical practices\n* Demonstrated clinical success\n* Can be easily produced",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, and the prognosis of this disease is dismal, despite aggressive standard-of-care therapy with chemoradiation and gross tumor resection. Several molecular mechanisms are known to contribute to the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma. Major players include EGFR, VEGF, and MGMT, which are involved in cell survival, the development of new blood vessels, and resistance to chemotherapeutics, respectively. Studies have shown that monovalent therapeutics targeting these molecules elicit appreciable antitumor effects; nevertheless, acquired resistance to these therapies generally occurs. Thus, the current consensus on glioblastoma treatment is that multi-targeted approaches are likely required to treat this devastating tumor.\n\nDr. Hai Yan, renowned in the field of glioma research, has developed an RNA-interference-based modality using siRNA for suppressing multiple oncogenic genes within glioblastoma cells. Molecules of relevance include, but are not limited to, EGFR, VEGF, and MGMT. siRNAs targeting these genes, which have been shown to significantly suppress the expression of their targets, are administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and can be preferentially targeted to glioblastoma cells using an array of glioblastoma cell-focused ligands (e.g. EGFR receptor ligand). Such a modality has the potential to elicit direct tumoricidal effects and cause glioblastoma cells to become vulnerable to conventional treatments (e.g. temozolomide chemotherapy).\n\nThe activity of the oncogenic proteins EGFR, VEGF, and/or MGMT has been detected in non-glioma tumors. Therefore, this invention may have application beyond gliomas for alternative tumor types.\n\nThe current invention targets at least three distinct mechanisms that are known to contribute glioblastoma viability: proliferation, angiogenesis, and chemotherapeutic resistance. This is particularly advantageous given that the profound heterogeneity of glioblastoma tumors is thought to underlie its ability to acquire resistance to monovalent therapies. By targeting a broad array of oncogenic molecules that are involved in unique tumorigenic pathways, there is an _a priori_ increased likelihood of therapeutic success.",

The most effective method for flu prevention is vaccination, however, due to seasonal variability in circulating strains of influenza, a new vaccine formulation must be developed each year. Current methods for vaccine manufacture involve culturing distinct flu isolates having different hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins using chicken eggs. This culture process is complicated by the existence of poor-growing influenza isolates and carries a risk of inducing adaptive viral mutations that can render a vaccine ineffective. This technology enables the expression of multiple influenza HA proteins on a single virion, allowing a poorly growing, mutation-prone strain of influenza to be paired with a robust, laboratory-adapted strain. This allows the efficient vaccine production from poorly growing viral isolates with reduced risk of viral mutation. Through bypassing optimization required for traditional production of difficult viral strains, this technology may yield both increased speed and efficacy of influenza vaccine manufacture. This technology could also be used to improve production for coronavirus vaccines. The technology can be used to generate COVID-19 vaccines that elicit strong mucosal responses to protect during respiratory transmission. Due to the specific design of this technology, it is possible to express proteins from pathogens other than the influenza virus. This could provide an exciting opportunity for the development of combined vaccines eliciting protection against multiple distinct agents which have previously been difficult to vaccinate against.

    "ip_description": "Endoscopy is an extremely important and prevalent procedure for the diagnosis of a variety of disorders affecting the esophageal and gastrointestinal tracts such as colorectal cancer, adenoma, inflammatory bowel disease, and intestinal metaplasia. Endoscopy procedures can be used for image guided surveillance of tissues as well as for the removal of abnormal or diseased structures such as neoplastic, malignant lesions and polyps. State-of-the art optical endoscopes utilize white light for imaging. While this technique provides adequate visualization of tissues layers in direct contact with the probe face, it does not provide any information about underlying tissue structures and is limited in its ability to accurately distinguish the borders between healthy and diseased tissues. Consequently, it leads to high rates of missed abnormalities that may be hidden behind folds in the tissue layers or when lesions are relatively flat.\n\nThe proposed device in an endoscopic probe that utilizes a novel optical spectroscopy-based method to reconstruct images with greater functionality and diagnostic accuracy. Using this technique could raise detection rates of diseased tissues, decrease procedure times for surveillance procedures, and improve accuracy of targeted tissue biopsies. The device uses optimized photodetector-based apertures for the detection and interrogation of tissue using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy of optical signals. In addition, the highly customizable photodetectors can be used for spatially-resolved imaging thereby providing information about the tissue through depth so as to circumvent tissue folds.\n\nWhile these technologies have been proposed for implementation on colonoscopes, they can also be extended to other forms of endoscopes as well as instruments used for laparoscopic surgery.\n\nThe use of photodetectors for imaging (over optical fibers) is not only more efficient but also allows for optimization of the optical properties that the device is sensitive to based on the tissue to be imaged. It would improve the accuracy of colonoscopies, decrease the need for follow-up scans and could even reduce the number of physical biopsies \u2013 thereby reducing the risk for patients. Additionally, the proposed device provides the potential for customization on not only the photo-detectors but also the light source.

    "ip_description": "Many tumors are dependent on de novo fatty acid synthesis as a source of long chain fatty acids to maintain growth and interdicting at key steps in this pathway may have therapeutic benefit. Fatty acid synthase I (FASN) catalyzes the final step leading to the synthesis of fatty acids in vivo. In rapidly proliferating cells, such as cancer, FASN is needed to provide sufficient lipids for membrane formation and energy production as well as lipid modification of proteins. FASN is highly expressed in cancer, including colorectal, breast, lung, prostate, ovarian, and many more. Elevated FASN expression has been correlated with poor prognosis and reduced disease-free survival in colon cancer, prostate cancer, and sarcomas. Furthermore, FASN has been shown to serve as a bona fide oncogene in prostate and breast cancer, which may result from activation of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway by FASN. Thus, blocking FASN represents a unique opportunity to effectively treat multiple tumor types.\n\nIn order to find an effective FASN inhibitor, the inventors panned 3,379 purine based compounds against mammary gland extract (rich source of FASN). The 20 highest hits were tested for anti-FASN activity in a [3H]glucose incorporation assay and the molecule with the highest activity, HS-106, was designated as lead compound. HS-106 is a thiophenopyrimidine that inhibits FASN by binding to its purine-binding cofactor domain. Cellular inhibition of FASN leads to apoptosis in cells dependent on FASN. Thus, this technology can inhibit cancer cell growth and may treat patients with cancer. Global lipodomics studies of breast cancer cells treated with HS-106 showed profound changes in cellular lipid profiles and sharply increased ceramide uptake. The increase in ceramide levels contributed to the apoptosis that reduced tumor growth in a Her2+ breast cancer mouse model.\n\nAdditionally, inhibition of FASN could also be effective against various viruses, including HIV, that are dependent on FASN for completing intracellular replication.\n\nFASN is considered an attractive target for cancer therapy due to the selective dependence of many tumors on de novo fatty acid synthesis. Many trials for the development of FASN inhibitors had previously failed to advance to translational studies, and only one FASN inhibitor was able to progress forward in clinical trials and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 trial for treating HER2 positive breast cancer. The molecule described here effectively inhibits FASN, leading to lipidomic changes and increased ceramide uptake and inhibits tumor cell growth in a clinically relevant breast cancer mouse model.",

However, the limiting factor in vitreoretinal surgery remains the ability to distinguish between tissues with subtle contrast and to judge the location of an object relative to other retinal substructures. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is uniquely suited for vitreoretinal surgery where multiple layers of the retinal structure are readily accessible, and where high resolution cross-sectional viewing would immediately have an impact on surgery as it is performed today. This improvement in surgical visualization would impact the treatment of a wide range of ocular diseases including diabetic retinopathy with membranes in the macula, macular holes, epiretinal membranes, and retinal detachments.

A new Duke device using an intraoperative microscope-mounted optical coherence tomography system (MMOCT) has been demonstrated in vivo human retinal imaging. This optomechanical design adapts an Oculus Binocular Indirect Ophthalmo Microscope (BIOM3), suspended from an ophthalmic surgical microscope, with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scanning and relay optics.

SCS is based on the gate control theory of pain, where an implanted pulse generator delivers electrical pulses to an electrode array placed in the epidural/extradural space. This electrical generation inhibits ascending projection neurons in the dorsal column of the spinal cord conveying pain information to the brain by activating cutaneous Ab fibers in the dorsal root (DR). Successful SCS depends on selective activation of dorsal column fibers without activating mixed fibers in the DR, thereby producing unintended effects. However, the optimal approach of selectively activating dorsal column fibers has not been achieved. A novel SCS technology to address this issue would enter a growing global neurostimulation market for chronic pain expected to reach nearly $2.9B in 2018.\n\nThis technology encompasses a novel computer implemented method, based on patient-specific computational modeling, to select stimulation parameters in SCS.

Catheters are ubiquitously used for the drainage of fluids, the infusion of fluids or the insertion of surgical or diagnostic instruments into a body cavity. Its wide applications make catheters essential devices in cardiology, interventional radiology, neuroradiology, urology, and neurosurgery. Since the initial use of catheter directed therapeutics, more complex techniques requiring advanced and expensive catheters has been developed. In addition, multiple catheters and microcatheters will be needed for sophisticated interventions. These lengthy catheters are often difficult to store and control during the procedure. The current storage technique uses a single sterile plastic basin containing saline fluid to store all the catheters used during the medical procedure. However, such storage system does not support rapid storage and retrieval of the individual desired device. Moreover, a single unintentionally dropped or contaminated catheter can cause a financial lose in the order of hundreds of dollars. To allow repaid storage and retrieval of the desired device during procedures, Dr. Lessne invented a multi-compartment interventional wire and catheter storage systems.

Each passage contains a guiding tube which can lead wires and catheters to the outside of the storage basin. Wall grooves are placed in each passage to direct wires and catheters to be easily coiled in a clockwise direction. Plastic lips are placed atop each individual passage to prevent the upward migration of the wire during coiling and storage. Storage solution and a lid sized for the storage basin can be used to ensure further security of sorted wires.

While most dengue infections are mild, some can develop into Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) or Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) or Severe Dengue (SD), which involve increased vascular permeability and hemorrhaging of internal organs. Currently, there are not tests to distinguish between mild dengue infections and DHF/DSS or SD. Also, there are no therapies to prevent virus-induced bleeding in these patients. Accurate detection of DHF/DSS or SD can lead to timely medical intervention and the administration vascular integrity supportive care to prevent severe complications and death.\n\nThis technology is for the diagnosis and prevention of mast cell induced vascular permeability during dengue infection. Mast cells line blood vessels and support vascular integrity, tone, and function. Degranulation of mast cells leads to the breakdown of cellular junctions and vascular leakage. Administration of a mast cell stabilizers was shown to decrease vascular leakage and decrease serum mast cell protease 1 (MCPT1), a product of mast cell activation, in a mouse model of dengue infection. In addition, mast cell stabilizers were shown to be effective at preventing vascular leakage during a secondary dengue infection in mice that were perfused with antibodies against dengue prior to infection. Finally, serum levels of chymase, a human MCPT1 homolog, were shown to be predictive of dengue infection in humans and could be used to distinguish between mild dengue fever and DHF/DSS or SD.

Producing biologics on a small-scale is beneficial for initial activity screening and the short-shelf life can make larger-scale synthesis unnecessary. The short-shelf life of biologics also requires additional resources for transporting these molecules beyond the manufacturing site, affecting remote or undeveloped areas the most. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop technologies for versatile and scalable on-demand production of diverse biologics, as well as subsequent analysis and purification.\n\nBy exploiting cell\u2013material feedback, Duke inventors have designed a concise single-use technology platform to achieve versatile production, analysis and purification of diverse proteins and protein complexes. Engineered bacteria that are programmed to produce a protein of interest are first encapsulated. As the bacteria population grows within this capsule, a chain of events is triggered that results in these capsules squeezing out the desired protein products. This process physically separates the byproducts associated with cell lysis from the protein of interest, eliminating the need for a centrifuge.

    "ip_description": "The hedgehog signaling pathway is an important mediator of developmental and cellular differentiation processes in both embryonic and adult tissues, but can also promote tumor growth and progression if dysregulated. Two forms of cancer, basal cell carcinoma (BCC; the most common form of skin cancer) and medulloblastoma (MB; a common pediatric brain tumor), are known to be driven by hedgehog signaling. Drugs targeting the hedgehog pathway component smoothened (SMO) have proven to be effective anti-cancer therapeutics in BCC and MB. However, like most cancer therapies, tumors eventually develop resistance, compromising efficacy. This technology provides for a SMO inhibitor which maintains antagonist activity against both normal and mutant forms of SMO, which may be useful as a novel therapeutic agent for anti-cancer therapy in BCC or MB patients who have developed resistance to existing therapies.\n\nThis invention is a novel small molecule inhibitor of SMO, which has been developed to be mutation-resistant. Using an _in vitro_ cell culture system, this compound was shown to inhibit both normal and the D473H-mutant form of SMO which has been observed in human medulloblastoma treated with an existing FDA-approved SMO antagonist. Importantly, in a side-by-side comparison, this compound was as effective as two separate marketed SMO antagonists at suppressing hedgehog signaling, and retained full inhibitory activity against D473H-mutant SMO, whereas both marketed therapies were ineffective. Additionally, _in vivo_ efficacy has been demonstrated in a mouse model of hedgehog-dependent hair regrowth.\n\nAlthough the role of hedgehog signaling in the progression of cancers other than BCC or MB is less clear, several clinical trials are ongoing using SMO inhibitors in numerous cancers including pancreatic, gastrointestinal, and lung. This invention may be applicable as a therapy to these types of cancers in addition to BCC and MB.\n\nExisting therapies targeting SMO in cancer are rendered ineffective by specific mutations in SMO. Compared to marketed therapies, this invention shows similar inhibition of normal SMO but dramatically improved activity against a clinically-relevant SMO mutation. This may be useful as a therapy to treat patients with BCC or MB who have developed resistance to current therapies.",

    "ip_description": "Insect vector-borne infectious diseases are a major public health threat to both developing and industrialized nations. Though many insects may transmit disease, mosquitoes of of the _Aedes_ and _Anopheles_ genus are particularly known for their transmission of many infectious agents. These include _Plasmodium_ sp., the causative agents of malaria, as well as numerous viruses including West Nile Virus, Zika Virus, and the causative agents of yellow fever and dengue fever. Most of these infectious agents do not have effective vaccines or treatments, therefore prevention is focused on reducing the exposure of people to the mosquitoes which carry such microorganisms. One of the most effective methods of reducing exposure involves using chemical insect repellants, such as DEET, which trigger sensory pathways in insects which cause them to avoid objects or people coated in said repellant. However, due to health concerns, DEET is often passed over by consumers in favor of less-effective alternatives. This technology provides a novel platform for the development of new insect repellant chemicals by enabling the direct assessment of receptor-stimulatory activity in insect cells, thereby allowing the development of more effective and safe alternatives to current insect repellants.\n\nThe inventors of this technology have identified a member of the Transient Receptor Potential Channel (TRP) superfamily of proteins which is responsible for the insect repellant activity of DEET in _Drosophila_ flies. When this receptor is genetically ablated, flies become insensitive to DEET activity. Importantly, homologous forms of this receptor have been identified in _Aedes_ and _Anopheles_ mosquitoes. This technology enables exogenous expression of mosquito (or other insect) TRP-family proteins in cell lines and subsequent detection of TRP-dependent signaling induced by candidate compounds, which is indicative of putative insect repellant activity.\n\nThis technology may also be useful for screening compounds with repellant activity against arachnids, or against other insects relevant to agricultural interests, rather than public health. Additionally, by comparing repellant activity against homologous receptors from two species, this technology may be used to develop species-selective insect repellants.\n\nAdvantages:\n*   Current alternatives to DEET insect repellants are considerably less effective, however, consumer health concerns often lead to the purchase of these alternatives.\n*   This technology enables the identification of novel alternatives through screening using an insect receptor directly responsible for DEET sensitivity.",

This inflammation is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize a variety of ligands including bacterial membrane molecules and nucleic-acids. One type of extensively studied PRRs are Toll-like Receptors (TLRs). TLRs are an attractive drug target because the improper activation of TLRs leads to a variety of diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus, bacterial sepsis, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, due to redundancy and crosstalk, effective mitigation of a pathogenic inflammatory response is likely to require inactivation of multiple TLRs simultaneously. While many TLR antagonists have been developed, very few are available for clinical use, and most have adverse side effects and limited success in treating inflammatory diseases. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of both safe and efficacious TLR inhibitors.\n\nThis technology uses cationic polymers to bind nucleic acids, neutralize nucleic acid-induced endosomal TLRs, and prevent TLR activation. It has been shown that these cationic polymers are capable of simultaneously preventing TLR3 and TLR9 activation in a macrophage cell line. Additionally, the polymers were well tolerated both _in-vitro_ and _in-vivo_, showing little toxicity. Finally, these polymers were shown to dramatically reduce acute TLR-mediated liver damage in mice sensitized with TLR agonists. As such, this technology has tremendous potential for the treatment of nucleic acid-induced autoimmune and inflammatory responses in a variety of diseases.\n\nOther Applications\n*   Treatment of thrombic disorders\n\nAdvantages\n*   Specific for nucleic acid-induced TLRs\n*   Prevents activation of multiple TLRs simultaneously\n*   Prevents nucleic acid-induced TLR activation without compromising the ability to combat viral infections\n*   Low toxicity",

In the setting of chronic wounds, dead and dying cells are continuously releasing nucleic acids that trigger inflammatory pathways and prevent wound healing. Furthermore, microorganisms can colonize chronic wounds and form biofilms, which further contributes to the ongoing cycle of inflammation that sabotages effective wound healing. A means of inhibiting inflammatory molecules and the ability of microorganisms to form biofilms may assist in the healing of chronic wounds.\n\nPolycationic nanofibers are made by electrospinning a neutral polymer to produce nanofibers <2\u03bcm in diameter and grafting a cationic polymer onto the neutral polymer nanofiber. Polycationic nanofibers can then absorb anionic substances in a solution such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, anti-coagulant proteins, or microorganisms capable of forming biofilms. Polycationic nanofibers can be incorporated into a medical device, bandage, or dressing, or may be used in a solution or administered directly to the patient. Thus, this has the potential to greatly reduce the incidence of inflammation and microbe infiltration at the wound site and improve wound healing.\n\nThe use of polycationic nanofibers to scavenge pro-inflammatory nucleic acids, other anionic compounds such as anticoagulant proteins, and to inhibit the growth of microbes and biofilms can also be applied to other situations, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n*   Use of polycationic nanofibers at site of chemotherapeutic treatment or other treatment likely to induce cell death or inflammation\n*   Ex vivo extracorporeal circuit for hemofiltration to deplete anionic compounds from the bloodstream\n*   Medical devices coated with polycationic nanofibers\n*   Administration to a patient to reverse the effects of an anionic anti-coagulant such as heparin\n\nAdvantages:\n\n*   Experimental evidence from the inventors demonstrates that polycationic nanofibers:\n*   Block activation of pro-inflammatory NF-kB cells by selectively inhibiting nucleic acid based agonists\n*   Reduce chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity by scavenging extracellular nucleic acids released from doxycycline-killed cells\n*   Significantly reduce total biofilm mass on adjacent surfaces and do not promote biofilm growth of two species of _Staphylococcus aureus_.\n\nThese properties of polycationic fibers may improve current chronic wound management strategies by decreasing inflammatory compounds and preventing infections.",

Thus, normal intensity imaging modalities, such as typical light or fluorescent microscopies, will result in low contrast images unless the samples are exogenously stained or tagged. However, it is noted that though such samples do not significantly change the intensity of the illumination, they do significantly affect the wavefront of the illumination light due to their intrinsic refractive index profiles, and thus can be viewed and imaged with high contrast as phase objects. To this end, phase contrast microscopy has quickly risen as a preferred method to image transparent samples and has found great success in imaging morphologies of live cells without exogenous contrast agents. Apart from contrast, another metric to determine image quality is optical resolution. In conventional microscopes, the maximum achievable resolution is set by the limiting aperture in the system and is coined as the diffraction limit.

Due to the transporter system used, various therapeutic agents could be coupled to this chaperone to enhance delivery into chondrocytes. In addition to intra-articular administration, this chaperone has the potential to enhance gastrointestinal absorption of oral bisphosphonates for the treatment of osteoporosis. Enhanced gastrointestinal absorption of chaperone-coupled bisphosphonates would provide the potential for therapeutic effectiveness at much lower oral doses compared with non-chaperone coupled bisphosphonates, thereby reducing the incidence of the gastrointestinal side effects associated with oral bisphosphonates. This technology could be a platform for developing treatments for a variety of other diseases including Paget\u2019s disease, abnormally increased bone turnover, periodontal disease, tooth loss, bone fractures, metastatic bone disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, multiple myeloma, and chondrosarcoma. Advantages include improving cartilage uptake of active agents for treating joint diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, reaching therapeutic effectiveness with lower oral doses of bisphosphonates, and being a platform that could also be used to improve the uptake of imaging agents.",

    "ip_description": "Aspirin is the most commonly prescribed anti-platelet medication for prevention of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Aspirin has long been viewed as an important first line measure for heart attack prevention, yet aspirin treatment only reduces risk of ACS by 12-22% in total-patient populations. Patients using aspirin still experience ACS or cardiovascular related death at rates of 3-4% per year. Furthermore, the American College of Cardiology & American Heart Association has recently emphasized that low-dose aspirin intake should only be prescribed by a doctor in select cases while the primary preventative benefits of aspirin intake are not well understood for each patient. Despite the clear advantages of low-dose aspirin preventative treatments in many patients, there remains an important need to better understand, monitor, and predict the effect that antiplatelet preventative measures may have on patients at risk for ACS.\n\nDuke inventors have patented the use of a novel RNA biomarkers that accurately define a patient\u2019s platelet functional status. Unlike available assays for directly measuring platelet function, these biomarkers collected from whole-blood RNA samples enable any clinician to rapidly identify patients that are not appropriately responding to preventative aspirin treatment and thus are at increased risk for a cardiovascular event. Accordingly, the inventive biomarker panel can readily inform treatment regimens, monitor their effectiveness, and predict risk of a future heart attack. These advances are capable of reshaping ACS preventative measures and maximizing the potential of established antiplatelet therapies.\n\nIn addition to applications in the cardiovascular field, the panel of biomarkers may also be useful for monitoring thrombosis treatments.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Platelet-function biomarker analysis is minimally invasive and enables clinicians to quickly identify patients that will respond to antiplatelet-based preventative measures\n- Whole blood RNA samples are easily collected and preserved with no additional processing required\n- RNA samples are readily stored and transported, making the predictive biomarker analysis widely available and accessible for the vast majority of patients at risk for ACS",

SLO is a confocal imaging technique similar to confocal microscopy that can acquire high contrast 2D en-face retinal images in real time. OCT is an interferometric imaging technique that allows for high resolution depth sectioning and has the capability of producing high-resolution 2D cross sectional images (B-scans) of the retina at and exceeding video rate. The combination of SLO and OCT has been shown to provide more comprehensive retinal imaging, which have previously implemented into a handheld system. However, this system was relatively heavy as a handheld device. The main features that constrained the minimum size and weight of this system were: 1) bulky galvanometer and resonant scanners, 2) the separation of OCT and SLO scanners, and 3) the separation of OCT and SLO illumination and collection paths. A new Duke technology, an ultra-compact SLO and spectral domain OCT handheld probe, weighing only 94 g which makes it possible for handheld purposes. This was possible due to the use of a single microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) scanner for both SLO and OCT, a custom compact optical design that utilizes a converging beam prior to the scanner, and a single fiber input for both SLO and OCT illumination and collection.

Musculoskeletal diseases include a multitude of disorders that are prevalent in aging populations, with osteoporosis and osteoarthritis (OA) existing as the most common forms. Currently, OA is a major cause of physical disability in the U.S. affecting nearly 27 million people and costing approximately $5,700 annually per person living with OA, with the numbers expected to increase dramatically as the population ages (Arthritis Foundation, 2008). Current biomarkers are able to diagnosis musculoskeletal diseases, such as OA, by measuring protein turnover, but do not allow for the age of a given protein or protein fragment to be estimated. By determining the relative age of protein turnover biomarkers the presence, status, and prognosis for a given musculoskeletal disease can effectively be established. This proprietary technology provides novel biomarkers of musculoskeletal disease and novel methods of use that improve the diagnostic and predictive ability of biomarkers of musculoskeletal disease.

Depression is the fourth leading contributor of disease worldwide with 18.8 million adult sufferers in the United States alone.

Currently, there are multiple classes of anti-depressants including the selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), as well as the newer triple reuptake inhibitors (TRIs). These inhibitors work by targeting reuptake of one or more of the monoamines implicated in depression (serotonin norepinephrine and dopamine) to increase brain levels of monoamines. More specifically, anti-depressants generally function by blocking monoamine transporters which typically function to maintain monoamine levels. To further understand the function of the monoamine norepinephrine and its transporter, Duke University researchers have recently deleted the norepinephrine transporter (NET) in mice.

This therapy method has proven to be widely successful and one of the few curative methods against hematologic malignancies. However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the most serious complication of allogenic hematopoietic cell transplants that occurs in up to 50% of patients. To alleviate GVHD, donor leukocyte infusions (DLI) that contains re-stimulated T lymphocytes, has shown improvement in GVDH, viral infections, and lymphoma treatments. Despite this, DLI infusions are limited since they require leukocyte from the same hematopoietic cell transplant donor. An alternative source of T lymphocytes can be found in cord blood, but these T-cells are antigen inexperienced and will only provide limited protection. Therefore, there is an unmet need in the clinic for further therapies to provide hematopoietic cell transplant recipients better protection from GVHD and immune deficiency complications.\n\nTo alleviate allogenic hematopoietic cell transplant complications via leukocyte infusions, Dr. Szabolcs developed a novel method of isolating cord blood T-cells and stimulating them for increased proliferation and activation. The propagation of the na\u00efve T-cells occurs by stimulation with interleukins 7, 12, or 15 alone or in combination of each cytokine. Additionally, anti-CD3 and anti-CD8 antibodies are further added. The combination of the mentioned cytokines and anti-CD antibodies are responsible of inducing proliferation of cord blood T-cells and activation against cancer cell antigens. Lymphopenia (low T-lymphocyte number) is often observed in patients whom underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation and the increased proliferation of the cord blood T-cells is important to alleviate this issue.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Method of isolating T-cells from cord blood and increasing their activation and stimulation ex vivo.\n* Novel method to prevent and treat graft-versus-host disease.\n* Novel method to use stimulated T-cells against relapsed leukemia.",

The inhibition of HAS2 abrogated the invasive fibroblast phenotype, impeded myofibroblast accumulation, and inhibited the development of lung fibrosis. Additionally, CD44 treated with a blocking antibody reduced lung fibrosis in mice _in vivo_.

    "ip_description": "Vaccines have application for a wide range of human health conditions, including the treatment of pathogenic diseases, cancer immunotherapy, and the suppression of autoimmune disorders. In order to stimulate the immune system to react towards an immunogen, vaccines are often administered with an adjuvant, which includes an extensive list of compounds. Unfortunately, adjuvants have the potential to unfavorably polarize the immune response in a manner that is detrimental to the intended effect. Furthermore, adjuvants add complexity to the chemical definition of a vaccine, which can make regulatory approval a challenge. Consequently, vaccines that do not require the use of adjuvants would have a clear clinical benefit.\n\nDr. Joel Collier and colleagues have developed a novel, nanofiber vaccine platform that is composed of self-assembling, concatemerized antigens and does not require the use of an adjuvant to stimulate potent immune responses. Their studies show that, compared to conventional monomeric peptide vaccines, nanofiber vaccines are more readily taken up by dendritic cells \u2013 a major immune cell subset required for potentiating robust vaccine responses. Additionally, immunization with a nanofiber vaccine targeting the glioblastoma-specific mutation EGFRvIII was able to induce a protracted immune response that was greater than that which was engendered by a monomeric peptide vaccine administered with one of the most potent adjuvants, CFA.\n\nA major benefit of this self-adjuvanting vaccine platform is that it simplifies the immunological monitoring of the resulting immune response, given oft-used standard adjuvants have relatively indiscriminate immune-stimulatory activity. As an example, adjuvants alone can stimulate the secretion of cytokines that have little bearing on the antigen-specific vaccine response, which would confound the interpretation of the immune response. Additionally, a chemically-defined vaccine platform would simplify regulatory approval, considering that additional elements are not required.",

    "llm_summary": "**Summary:** Dr. Joel Collier and colleagues have developed a self-assembling nanofiber vaccine platform that does not require adjuvants to elicit strong immune responses. This innovative approach enhances the uptake of antigens by dendritic cells and has demonstrated superior immune response compared to traditional peptide vaccines, even those paired with potent adjuvants.\n\n**Applications:** This vaccine platform has potential applications in treating pathogenic diseases, cancer immunotherapy, and managing autoimmune disorders.\n\n**Problem Solved:** The technology addresses the limitations of conventional vaccines that rely on adjuvants, which can complicate regulatory approval and potentially skew immune responses. By eliminating the need for adjuvants, this platform simplifies vaccine formulation and monitoring of immune responses.",
