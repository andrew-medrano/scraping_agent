    "ip_description": "Neural networks are a powerful class of machine learning model that learn to perform useful operations such as classification, inference, and generation, and can be applied to a range of tasks, such as analysis and generating text, code, or images. Training these models, however, requires exponentially increasing amounts of data and computational power; they are also notoriously difficult to successfully optimize, potentially requiring several training attempts to attain satisfactory performance. Increasing the training efficacy of neural network models will therefore save time, reduce costs, and is an important step in unlocking further performance improvements.\n\nDrawing inspiration from how nature combines evolution with biological adaptation to produce natural intelligence, a Princeton researcher has developed a **new algorithm for training neural network models** that is composed of two optimization loops: the outer loop employs a proprietary genetic algorithm to optimize the initial state of the model, and the inner loop deploys gradient-based parameter updates to fine-tune the model. The algorithm is agnostic to the model architecture and task: it can be applied to small bespoke models learning well-defined associations or on large generative models.\n\nNovel methodological advancements were made to improve training speed and training efficacy of this algorithm. Models trained with this novel algorithm are over 20% faster than a standard genetic algorithm and are successfully trained at a rate almost 3x as high (increasing from a ~35% success rate to ~95%), as shown by testing with deep neural networks on a standard reinforcement learning benchmark. Efficacy was similarly improved (from ~70% to ~95%) over the standard and ubiquitous gradient-based method for training neural networks (stochastic gradient descent via backpropagation), thereby reducing the number of failed training runs and decreasing the amount of time and compute resources necessary to produce a successfully trained model. Taken together, this algorithm can be easily integrated into existing engineering workflows, is applicable to a diverse range of tasks and model architectures, and reduces the computational load and time required to successfully train neural network models.\n\n**Applications:**\n\u2022 Optimize the parameters of a deep neural network\n\u2022 Improve training speed and increase the success rate of model training\n\u2022 Potential to improve artificial intelligence learning and performance\n\n**Advantages:**\n\u2022 More efficient and robust than classic genetic algorithms\n\u2022 Improve training speed and increase the success rate of model training\n\u2022 Reduces computational cost by increasing training success rate\n\n**Stage of Development**\nA working version of the algorithm has been developed for an existing research project and has been validated as part of that project. Specifically, the project focused on simulating the evolution of astrobiological intelligence on non-Earth worlds. The model was used to train neural network models on a benchmark reinforcement learning task, and the training progression and efficacy was evaluated as part of this project. These results form the basis of the conclusion that this hybrid training algorithm boosts efficacy and robustness and is applicable to deep learning models.",

    "ip_description": "Solar energy conversion devices include photovoltaics, photoelectrochemical cells and photocatalysts, which convert the energy of sunlight into electricity and produce fuels from carbon dioxide and water. Different materials for making the solar energy conversion devices exhibit different energy conversion efficiencies and entail different costs. Currently, the most prevalent semiconductor material used in the solar industry is (poly)crystalline silicon for photovoltaics, which requires an expensive purification process to obtain pure and defect-free materials. First row transition metal oxides are much more affordable, because of their reasonable abundance, non-toxicity, ease of synthesis, and low cost for scaled-up manufacturing. However, a major setback of many transition metal oxides, which limits conversion efficiency, is low conductivity. W\u00fcstite [i.e., iron (II) oxide] is of particular interest, as it is inexpensive and non-toxic, and has a band gap in the optimal range for absorbing solar energy. However, w\u00fcstite suffers from thermodynamic instability in the bulk phase, but this disadvantage may be overcome by alloying with other stable oxides and potentially by nanostructuring. Using first-principles quantum mechanics calculations, researchers at Princeton University have discovered that adding small concentrations of an inexpensive additive (dopant) to Fe(II) metal oxide alloys can increase the number of charge carriers without adding charge trapping sites, and therefore can strongly enhance conductivity. Thus, the new doped material should improve the photon-to-current/fuel conversion efficiency of solar energy conversion devices. Advantages: Enhanced Conductivity, Improved efficiency, Low cost, No toxicity. Applications: Semiconductors in photovoltaic cells, Electrodes in photoelectrochemical cells, Photocatalysts for fuel production.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University have developed a piezoelectrochemical device which uses mechanical stress to produce a voltage/current. Mechanical energy harvesting is an increasingly important method of providing power to distributed sensor networks where physical connection to a power source is impractical. Conventional methods use vibrations to actuate a piezoelectric element, coil/magnet assembly, or capacitor plates, thereby generating an electric current. The low charge-density of these devices excludes their application in low frequency and static load sources, with the lowest frequency reported devices limited to 10 Hz. This innovation relates to a device for harvesting mechanical energy through a piezoelectrochemical effect, a similar but physically distinct effect from the piezoelectric effect. Piezoelectrics use mechanical deformation to physically separate charges in a crystal to produce a voltage, whereas piezoelectrochemical materials use mechanical stress to alter the thermodynamics of an electrochemical reaction to produce a voltage/current. Piezoelectrochemical energy harvesters are expected to produce orders of magnitude more energy per load cycle than piezoelectrics and comparable power capabilities. These characteristics make piezoelectrochemical energy harvesters ideal for application in low-frequency and static loading scenarios for which conventional mechanical energy harvesting technology is poorly suited. Examples of such load sources include, but are not limited to, human footsteps, vehicular loads, and pressure vessels.

    "ip_description": "Flying Pixels (FPs) are common artifacts in time-of-flight (ToF) imaging that arise at object boundaries, where light from both foreground and background is mixed, leading to inaccurate depth measurements and negatively impacting 3D vision tasks. The Mask-ToF approach addresses this issue by learning a microlens-level occlusion mask that customizes the sub-aperture for each sensor pixel. This mask modulates the integration of foreground and background light on a per-pixel basis, effectively encoding scene geometry directly into the ToF measurements. By using a differentiable ToF simulator, Mask-ToF trains a refinement network that decodes this information, producing high-fidelity depth reconstructions with significantly reduced FP counts.\n\nThe technology has been validated through both simulated datasets and an experimental prototype, demonstrating that the optimized mask pattern can halve FP counts without requiring retraining, thereby generalizing well to real-world data. This innovation can be easily integrated into the manufacturing process of ToF devices, as the optimized mask can be lithographically fabricated and directly adhered to the sensor surface, with minimal impact on form factor and cost.

Existing PGPR technologies are difficult to insert in existing soil microbial communities and may decline in abundance over time due to competition in the microbiome at the root-soil interface and are thus unable to persistently promote growth. The engineered system of this invention has the potential to improve colonization and persistence of beneficial bacteria in this microbiome. In this novel system, plants are engineered to secrete molecules that can be used as a nutrient source specifically by engineered bacteria. The degradation of these molecules by the engineered bacteria occurs only when both the transgenic plants and transgenic bacteria are present, reducing off-target effects. Further, the researchers are developing a biocontainment measure to meet government regulations for the use of transgenic organisms such that the engineered bacteria survive only when given an essential metabolite. This technology can be utilized to improve agricultural yields without significant ecological impact. The system can be applied to common plants such as corn and soybean and users can mix and match different plant lines and bacteria strains as separate products. Applications: Agriculture, Biofuel production, Seed or liquid plant treatment, Increase plant resilience to stress, Improved plant resistance to disease. Advantages: Stronger and longer-lasting plant growth-promotion, Makes use of naturally occurring opines, Biocontainment measure, Improved conformation to regulations on the deployment of transgenic organisms, Reduced off-target growth promotion.",

Inventors at PPPL have conceived an invention focused on the protection of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) electromagnets. The innovation hinges on an integrated design method that employs inductively coupled normal-conducting elements embedded within the HTS coil winding. During a quench event, when the superconducting current decreases rapidly, the embedded conductor is induced with current, facilitating uniform propagation of the quench and effectively protecting the superconducting coil. Moreover, this technology doubles as a quench detector, simplifying the detection process with local sensors, such as Hall sensors or Rogowski sensors. During normal operation, the embedded conductors function as thermal conductors, helping to cool and stabilize the superconducting coil. This ensures robust quench protection for a wide range of HTS coils and is especially beneficial for large or high-field magnets. This new approach solves existing challenges by integrating engineered dump inductors into the coil design. These inductors serve as both normal-metal insulators during standard coil operation and fast energy extractors during quench events. This not only boosts coil winding pack current density and structural integrity but also eliminates the need for organic insulation and vacuum impregnation in the coil winding process.

    "ip_description": "Few technologies are available for analyzing or purifying, in a general way, large solutes labeled with a defined number of molecules. Large solutes could be organic or inorganic nanoparticles, large macromolecules, assemblies of macromolecules or nanoparticles, viruses, drug and vaccine delivery nanovesicles, to name a few. Researchers at Princeton University\u2019s Department of Chemistry have developed DNA valency sorting chromatography, a new method for separating large solutes based on the number of DNA-barcoded molecules displayed on their surface. In contrast to the conventional techniques that are only effective for small solutes, DNA valency sorting chromatography was designed specifically for the purification of large solutes. Two key features enable it to overcome the common limitations and purify a broader range of discrete DNA-tagged solutes. Using nanoparticles as an example: First, the underlying mechanism relies on the highly selective recognition of a short DNA barcode attached to the nanoparticle, rather than the global features of the entire nanoparticle solute. This means that the short DNA barcode can be recognized with high specificity regardless of nanoparticle size or surface chemistry, unlike existing methods. Second, in addition to selectivity, the underlying separation mechanism is programmable because a unique DNA sequence is used as a recognition element and digital encoder. The DNA sequence can be altered to predictably change its thermodynamic, kinetic, and recognition properties. This is advantageous compared to existing mechanisms, which rely on generic and unprogrammable properties like size, charge, or polarity, and it permits the technique to be operated with process conditions that are compatible with biologics or fragile nanomaterials. Importantly, this technology affords large-scale production in a highly programmable way. Applications: Production of DNA-barcoded large macromolecules, nanoparticles, and nanovesicles; Analysis and separation of nanoparticle mixtures; DNA/nanoparticle computation; Creation of programmable, active materials; Valency-defined functional materials; High-value and custom nanomaterials reagents; High-throughput flow through surface encoding.

It has been shown for more than 70 years that bacterial isolates from the gut microbiome can directly metabolize clinically used drugs, with important clinical implications (e.g., effects on toxicity or therapeutic efficacy). Despite this knowledge, the exact contribution of the gut microbiome to drug pharmacokinetics has not been considered in the drug development pipeline. Researchers at Princeton University\u2019s Department of Molecular Biology have developed a novel quantitative screen that directly measures the ability of the collective human gut microbiome to metabolize any drug of interest: Microbiome-Derived Metabolism Quantitative Screen, or MDM-QScreen. MDM-QScreen does not rely on single isolates of the gut microbiome, but instead takes into account the collective contribution of complex microbial communities that are derived from the gut microbiome. Importantly, MDM-QScreen accomplishes this goal in a subject-personalized manner, and quantifies the inter-individual variability between subjects with respect to their MDM. By discovering new drug-microbiome interactions, and quantifying their inter-individual variability, MDM-QScreen can be used to explain non-linear pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles for currently used drugs, inform future drug design and formulation for newly developed drugs, and guide efforts for personalized medicine. MDM-QScreen can be used to discover, measure and explain inter-individual variability in drug metabolism that is attributed to the gut microbiome. This information is crucial in explaining potential toxic effects of administered drugs, as well variability in response to therapy between individuals. It is also important in understanding the mechanistic basis for how drugs are metabolized in the body, and to inform changes in drug design.

    "ip_description": "Debris Mitigation in Laser Produced Plasmas Using Three-Dimensional Manipulation of Magnetic Topology. Moore's law dictates that computer chips become ever smaller. The devices that fabricate these chips are facing constraints governed by fundamental physics. In order to achieve small chip size, the next generation of photolithography devices uses extreme ultraviolet (EUV) in order to produce smaller components. EUV is generated using laser produced plasma consisting of vaporizing tin droplets thousands of times a second with high powered lasers. This method can generate large amounts of high energy light, but the resulting debris eventually coats critical components inside the machine. This is especially detrimental to the delicate mirror which loses its reflectivity after a given number of shots. Charged debris particles moving through a magnetic field will be deflected from their original path, and careful configurations of magnetic fields can thus alter these trajectories and steer the particles away from the sensitive components. Disclosed is a method of debris mitigation in laser produced plasma EUV light sources. The method describes a class of magnetic field configurations which exhausts debris away from sensitive components of the EUV device. This class contains a large range of configurations that may be suited and tuned to specific application requirements with a high degree of flexibility and can be generated by coils that are located away from the light collection cone.

    "ip_description": "Novel Stellarator Design\nPrinceton Docket # 21-3827 / 3821 / 3822\nProcedure for Designing Arrays of Permanent Magnets\nPPPL inventors have developed a novel procedure for designing an array of magnets for confining stellarator plasmas using a small number of unique magnet parts. The parts consist of identically shaped cubes, each of which is polarized along one of as few as three unique orientations. The procedure has been shown to arrive at solutions in which the surface-averaged relative normal component of the magnetic field on the plasma boundary is well below 1%, satisfying physics requirements for field accuracy. An additional distinguishing feature of this procedure is that the polarization directions of the magnets need not be pre-specified; rather, they can be optimized in such a way as to make more efficient use of the available space for magnets.\nAll Planar Coil Stellarator\nGiven an optimized plasma target and a large field coil array that produces a predominantly toroidal field, the surface dipole distribution that produces the required fields for the plasma can be determined using the virtual casing theorem. This continuous distribution can then be discretized using numerous numerical techniques. This will give the field requirements for a series of small, discrete circular coils that will be distributed on the surface. The number of small coils is chosen to minimize cost and complexity while meeting the field accuracy requirements. The plasma can then be reconstructed using a free-boundary plasma solver and the plasma properties compared to the original target. The procedure above can be solved iteratively to optimize the target plasma properties and magnetic field coil requirements, including optimizing the properties of the planar toroidal array. Mechanical supports can then be designed to react to the forces on the coils. Minimizing force is another possible optimization parameter. The large number of free coil current parameters will enable the precise control of the 3D equilibrium as plasma parameters vary. This enables a wide operating window of plasma parameters for the stellarator.\nStellarator Neutron Source\nModern stellarators use numerical optimization to improve the confinement properties. Because of this, the magnetic field coils are designed to make the fields that provide this optimized behavior. Recently schemes have been developed to improve the fast particle confinement of stellarators. The concept is to use negative ion neutral beams to accelerate deuterium to energies near the peak of the D-D fusion cross-section and to inject this beam into a stellarator that has been optimized for fast ion confinement. The scale and operating parameters of the stellarator will be set by the required path length to fully absorb the neutral beam energy. Counter streaming beams will be beneficial, but not required. The electron temperature will be adjusted (using, e.g. electron cyclotron heating) so that the beam slowing down time is long enough for the fast ions to create sufficient neutron flux.\nApplications\nMagnetically confining stellarator plasmas\nAdvantages\nDrastically simplifies the design of a stellarator by removing the need for complex 3D coils\nEnables designs of magnet arrays consisting of a small number of unique parts\u2014as few as three\u2014allowing for efficient bulk fabrication of the magnets\nMakes more efficient use of the available magnet volume and/or enables confinement of plasmas with higher overall magnetic field strengths",

The new thruster would propel a spacecraft far more efficiently than currently available plasma thrusters, which use electric fields to propel particles.

    "ip_description": "Researchers in the Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University have developed a novel method to quantify a physical interaction between the proteins called RhlR and PqsE from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a globally important pathogen. The data show that RhlR-PqsE interaction is required for the bacterium to be virulent. Thus, targeting such proteins or their interaction could be leads for antimicrobial drug development. Additionally it would also be possible to use this method to report on the interaction between the two proteins to screen for compounds that bind and disrupt the interaction. Again, these molecules could form the basis of novel antimicrobial therapies. Because PqsE regulates RhlR which, in turn, controls biofilm formation and virulence factor production, disrupting the PqsE-RhlR interaction suppresses these important pathogenicity traits. Thus, identifying agents that function as PqsE-RhlR interaction disrupters could be useful in medical applications (catheters, stents, breathing tubes and as medicines\u2026), aquatic applications, fisheries, and other circumstances where Pseudomonas biofilms and virulence factor production are a commercial or medical problems. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that can cause fatal infections. There exists an urgent need for new, effective antimicrobial agents to combat P. aeruginosa. Many P. aeruginosa virulence factors are under the control of the quorum-sensing-related protein, PqsE, a metallo-\u03b2-hydrolase enzyme. The role PqsE plays in driving virulence factor production involves interaction with the RhlR quorum-sensing receptor. Disruption of this interaction suppresses virulence factor production, virulence gene expression and biofilm formation. Moreover, PqsE catalytic mutants and mutants impaired for interaction with RhlR demonstrate that it is the PqsE-RhlR interaction, not PqsE-mediated catalysis, that is responsible for promoting virulence factor production in P. aeruginosa. These findings provide a new route for drug discovery efforts targeting PqsE. Applications: Drug discovery to identify novel agents that disrupt virulence and biofilm formation in pathogenic bacteria, Biofilm remediation.

Nanomolar concentrations of vancomycin (~170 nM) and keratinicyclin B (~290 nM) are sufficient to inhibit the growth of >95% of cells in culture. By contrast, the concentration of vancomycin administered is >100 \u03bcM (typically 15\u201320 mg/kg for adults). Besides Clostridium difficile infection, the combination therapy disclosed herein could find therapeutic utility in other clostridial infections, including clostridial necrotizing enteritis and Clostridium perfringens. Other glycopeptide antibiotics, such as teicoplanin, also exhibit synergistic interaction with keratinicyclin B. Therefore, combinations of teicoplanin and keratinicyclin B (and other keratinicyclin variants) also provide a useful combination therapy. Applications: Combination therapy for Clostridial infections, Treatment for C. difficile \u2013 induced colitis, Extension to other glycopeptide antibiotics for use in combination therapy. Advantages: Highly selective for targeted therapy, Nanomolar potency, Less likely for resistant strains to develop, Safer in lower doses needed for efficacy. Stage of Development: Vancomycin and keratinicyclin B are secondary metabolites produced by soil-dwelling Amycolatopsis strains. Vancomycin is produced on an industrial scale by fermentation and is commercially available. The process for acquiring keratinicyclins in general, and specifically keratinicyclin B, involves fermentation in the presence of small-molecule elicitors and has been described in Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019, 15, 161\u2013168. It has been shown that when combined, vancomycin and keratinicyclin B interact synergistically to inhibit the growth of C. difficile at concentrations 8-fold lower than their respective minimal inhibitory concentrations.",

    "ip_description": "Sequence is at the basis of how the genome and its variations shape chromatin organization, regulate gene expression, and impact traits and diseases. Epigenomic profiling efforts have enabled large-scale identification of regulatory elements with chromatin states, yet we lack methods to systematically predict regulatory activities from any sequence and thus predict the effects of any variant on these activities. Researchers in Computer Science and the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Princeton University, the Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and The Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation have addressed this challenge with Sei, a new framework for integrating human genetics data with sequence information to discover the regulatory basis of human traits and diseases. Sei predicts a compendium of 21,907 chromatin profiles across >1,300 cell lines and tissues, the most comprehensive to-date, with a new deep learning sequence model, and integrates these predictions into 40 sequence classes. Sequence classes enable the prediction of quantitative variant effects on regulatory activities, such as loss or gain of cell-type-specific enhancer function. Sequence class predictions are supported by experimental data, including tissue-specific gene expression, expression quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and evolutionary constraints based on population allele frequencies. For proof of concept, sequence classes were applied to human genetics data. Sequence classes uniquely provide a non-overlapping partitioning of genome-wide association study (GWAS) heritability by tissue-specific regulatory activity categories, which were used to characterize the regulatory architecture of 47 traits and diseases from UK Biobank. Furthermore, the predicted directional alterations of sequence class activities suggest specific hypotheses for mechanisms of individual regulatory pathogenic mutations. Sei provides interpretations of human variation in the noncoding genome, identifying regulatory states de novo from sequence and the functional impact of mutations to those regulatory functions that may alter gene expression and lead to changes in health and disease. The molecular impact predicted by Sei can be used to make diagnoses and inform patient risk factors and treatment options. Applications: Interpretation of human genome variation in human health and disease, Prediction of disease risk, for personalized medicine, Inform patient treatment options. Advantages: Deep learning architecture to more efficiently train on the massive amounts of functional genomics data, Predictions for any mutation, Sei can determine what kind of regulatory element a mutation lies in and predict the impact of a mutation on the activity of the regulatory element (e.g. mutation disrupts a brain-specific enhancer). State of Development: The Sei framework is complete, with the Sei deep learning model fully trained and evaluated. As part of the validation of the framework, the researchers systematically compared Sei predictions to expression QTLs associated with changes in gene expression in specific tissue and demonstrated that Sei predictions for second order sequence class activity significantly correlate with the direction of expression change of tissue eQTLs. Furthermore, Sei predictions are consistent with the expected evolutionary constraints on highly impactful alleles: variants predicted to strongly perturb regulatory sequence classes had significantly lower allele frequencies than variants that weakly perturb these classes. Finally, the Sei framework predicted the disease regulatory mutation mechanisms for >100 known human disease mutations, of which the molecular mechanism of regulatory disruption for the majority of these mutations was previously unknown. The framework was also applied to analyze genome-wide regulatory signals for all 47 diseases and traits from UK Biobank GWAS and revealed a large concentration of GWAS heritability in trait-relevant, tissue-specific enhancer sequence classes.",

The intelligent ReChat suite lets researchers define instructions and questions to guide the chat, and configure additional options for the conversation. Using the various features provided by the ReChat suite, researchers can define multiple chatroom templates to conduct multiple studies simultaneously. Moreover, ReChat allows significant aspects of the research process to be fully automated, requiring no research assistants to moderate discussions, and employing a dynamic waiting room system to place participants into chatrooms as they are recruited, obviating the need for scheduling chat sessions in advance ( thus greatly reducing costly attrition).\n\nAdvantages\n\n*   Researcher-friendly interface for managing multiple live chat studies in tandem\n*    Multi-language support\n*     Dynamic waiting room system for live recruitment to minimize attrition\n*     Customizable room templates to specify group size, composition, duration, and questions/prompts to guide discussion\n*     Automated bot issues chat questions/prompts to the researcher's specification\n*     Optional human moderation of live conversation\n\nApplications\n\n*   Efficient management of large-scale chat studies.\n*   Versatile use to perform chat based studies on any topic\n*   Automated bots as moderators\n*   User-friendly exportations of chat transcripts\n\nBackground\n\nAccording to Pew research, Republicans and Democrats are more divided along ideological lines than at any point in the last two decades.\n\nOne possible solution to the above problem is to practice deliberative democracy. Deliberation is an approach to politics in which citizens are deeply involved in community problem solving and public decision making. There is growing empirical evidence showing that deliberative practices can flourish in deeply divided societies to good effect. Under the right conditions, deliberation in divided societies can help to bridge the deep conflicts across religious, national, racial, and ethnic lines.\n\nThe question then becomes: what kind of deliberation will be more effective? What group structures and deliberation procedures should we follow? These all require experimental tests.\n\nTraditional research convenes experiment participants to a physical lab for face-to-face discussion. This creates difficulties at all stages of the research process, including recruitment, experimental treatment manipulation, and data collection. It is also highly expensive, which often leads to sample size reduction as a trade-off.\n\nReChat, an integrated and interactive chat suite for online survey experiments, represents a solution to this problem.

Proof of concept and a lead compound have been identified allowing for the development of novel derivatives through further drug discovery and medicinal chemistry efforts. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) is a heme enzyme that catalyzes the oxygenation of the indole ring in tryptophan to afford N-formylkynurenine. The oxidation of tryptophan through IDO1 activity plays a central role in immune regulation and provides a necessary brake to prevent autoimmunity and damaging inflammation. Princeton researchers show that polysulfides bind to IDO1 and reduce it to the active ferrous state, linking the immune response in a novel way to sulfide signaling. Further, the Groves Lab has demonstrated that 3-mercaptoindole (3MI) replicates these effects, which inspires a new class of selective IDO1-reducing agonists.

    "ip_number": "21-3797-1",
    "published_date": "5/10/2021",
    "ip_description": "Researchers in the Department of Sociology at Princeton University have developed an algorithm to calculate a particular type of genetic score, Variation Polygenic Score \u2013 vPGS, based on genotypic information that is provided by commercially available technologies ranging from \u201cSNP-chips\u201d to whole genome sequencing. Polygenic scores attempt to summarize the genetic propensity for, or risk, of a given phenotype, (i.e. disease or trait) and have been around for more than a decade. They aim to predict the level of a trait i.e. how tall or short someone may be or what their blood pressure or BMI might be. The vPGS is different. Its purpose is not to predict whether someone who scores higher or lower on the vPGS will be, for instance, heavier or lighter or have a higher or lower IQ. Rather, it is formulated to predict variation. As an example, if we divided people into two groups based on having a high vPGS or a low vPGS, they may have the same average height of five-foot- nine-inches. But those in the low vPGS group may be all clustered around that mean level of 5\u20199\u201d (say, +/- 2 inches). However, those in the high vPGS group may have a much broader range, say 5\u20199\u201d +/- 4 inches. (Actually, the range would be expressed in standard deviations, but inches are used here to illustrate the point.) Moreover, a traditional PGS for body mass index (BMI) might predict one group to have a BMI of 28 and another group to have one of 23. Our vPGS again does not predict the mean level but rather the dispersion around that mean. It likely also predicts individual changes in BMI over the lifecourse (i.e. whether an individual tends to fluctuate greatly in weight). We have also demonstrated that vPGS is very suited for gene-environment interaction studies: that is, it is a good measure of the genetic propensity to be influenced by the environment for a particular trait. vPGS can be utilized by pharmaceutical companies and in other experimental settings. As an example, since efficacy of pharmaceuticals (or any treatment) is based on the difference between the treatment group (who receives the drug) and the control group (who receives a placebo), when there is a high \u201cplacebo\u201d effect, that makes it all the more difficult to demonstrate a true effect of the treatment. Companies who run trials, then, sometimes try to determine who is likely to demonstrate a big placebo effect and eliminate them from the subject pool. The vPGS offers a different, complementary approach: By scoring potential subjects for an experimental blood pressure medication (for instance) on their vPGS for blood pressure, trials can retain only those subjects with a high vPGS; that is, subjects whose genetic architecture likely makes them more \u201csensitive\u201d to treatments. This, in turn, may magnify effects, increase statistically power and lower the costs of trials (by requiring fewer subjects to demonstrate a statistically significant effect). This approach need not be limited to pharmaceutical interventions but can be applied to any randomized controlled trial. Other applications may be in risk screening in clinical and non-clinical settings where the vPGS may be helpful as well. Applications: \u2022 Improved clinical design for drug development \u2022 Prediction of who will respond to soci-behavorial treatments Advantages: \u2022 Applicable in any randomized controlled trial, or any outcome that has been measured in datasets with genetic information \u2022 Costs savings in any randomized controlled trial",

    "ip_description": "Trendme - Ratings in Real Time for Better Decisions for Consumers and for Providers in Improved Services and Goods. Researchers in the Department of Sociology at Princeton University and in the Department of Psychology at Hunter College have developed a new process by which consumers and/or producers of goods and/or services can organize ratings temporally. The process can be achieved through a web browser extension on the user side or by the producer side as a feature of their display of ratings. This innovation allows the user to adjudicate between choices with more timely and relevant information (i.e. the difference between two \u201cfour-star\u201d rated restaurants may be that one is improving in quality and the other is declining). Moreover, it allows the producer or service provider to learn from the trend information, by observing the impact of dynamic changes in the nature of the service or product on ratings in real time. Trendme can be used by end users to make better decisions and by producers to improve services/goods through social learning. Background: The statistical gold standard for designing crowd-sourced information systems has been to obtain independent and unbiased evaluations (Heckman 1979). But in crowd-sourced systems that rely on voluntary cooperation, outcomes may depend on dynamic interactions between cooperation and crowd wisdom. Minimizing social influences then bears the cost of compromising crowd wisdom. More importantly, minimizing social influences may interfere with efforts to perpetuate cooperation. In a preliminary field study, we demonstrated a positive outcome of increasing social influences in a rating system (Tchernichovski et al. 2017). In a more recent study (Tchernichovski et al. 2019) we demonstrated the utility of virtual world experiment in optimizing crowd wisdom via costly signaling (Princeton Docket # 20-3660, A Rating Method for Improved Accuracy of Customer Evaluations and Cost Savings). Trendme extends these virtual world experiments into a generalized system for optimizing the utility of social influences in crowd sourced evaluation systems by presentation of trends of ratings/evaluations in lieu of the traditional approach of reporting cumulative scores.

    "ip_description": "Researchers in the Department of Physics at Princeton University have designed a self-disinfecting reverse adhesive bandages for healthcare use. One of the primary mechanisms of viral and bacterial transmission, particularly SARS-CoV-2, is by transfer of the infectious agent by touch contact with a contaminated surface, and then touching another surface or person. Wearing of medical gloves, while that may prevent secondary transfer of the agent to the wearer, does not prevent surface to surface transfer. Active destruction of the infectious agent upon contact with a self-disinfecting surface would however both protect the person touching the surface and prevent transfer of the infectious agent. Medical adhesive strips, commonly called Band-Aid\u00ae (a registered trademark of Johnson & Johnson) commonly act to disinfect inwards: that is, they disinfect infectious agents penetrating the Band-Aid\u00ae from the outside into an open wound but fail to prevent surface to surface transfer. We have designed a 'reverse adhesive bandage'. The 'reverse adhesive bandage' would serve to kill infectious agents on the surface of the bandage, rendering the touch of the person actively sterile. These strips would be expected to maintain their active disinfectant action for periods up to 12 hours, with a color indicator showing that the reservoir of the disinfectant has evaporated. The 'reverse bandage' could then be easily peeled off and replaced. These 'reverse bandage' could be adhered to medical gloves for medical workers for example, or put directly on fingers of consumers, since the disinfectant is never in contact with the skin. Applications: Consumer-level use for protection against pathogen bearing surfaces. Medical applications to reduce possible pathogen spread within a facility. Advantages: Mitigates the possibility of pathogen spread from non-sterile surfaces. Prevent surface to surface transfer. Active disinfectant action for periods up to 12 hours, with color indicator when depleted. Versatile utility \u2013 self disinfecting.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers in the Neuroscience Department at Princeton University have created a smartphone-based application that enables performing neurobehavioral tests, including but not limited to eyeblink conditioning. Eyeblink conditioning is a form of Pavlovian conditioning and is widely used in neuroscience to study mechanisms underlying learning and memory formation. Currently, eyeblink conditioning in humans requires expensive and dedicated hardware and software in a permanent environment. Moreover, data acquisition and analysis require quite extensive programming skills, and performing high-throughput parallel experiments requires a well-organized and clever database management system. Blink Lab, a mobile phone application to perform eyeblink conditioning remotely using the user\u2019s own cell phone, will surmount these challenges. Blink Lab is a \u2018total care\u2019 package that alleviates potential users from the requirement of technical skills and extensive programming and enables reliable and reproducible eyeblink conditioning experiments for scientific, medical, and personal use. Another major advantage of the app is the fact that no equipment needs to be attached to the face, which is especially advantageous for infants and autistic patients. Eyeblink conditioning is affected in various neurological and psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, autism, attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), and Fragile-X syndrome, which opens up the possibility to use eyeblink conditioning as a simple, low-cost, and non-invasive diagnostic tool or evaluation parameter for testing therapeutic measures.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Princeton University and University of Tokyo have combined mRNA display technology with lipid-nanodisc based selections to identify high affinity ligands of the integral membrane sensor domain of the histidine kinase, AgrC. In S. aureus, virulence gene expression is under the control of the accessory gene regulator (agr) quorum sensing system. Within the agr circuit, AgrC, senses the quorum signal and is critical to the regulation of virulence. QQs are molecules that can bind to the integral membrane sensor domain of AgrC and are potent inhibitors of S. aureus virulence in vitro and in vivo. The QQs are not only potent inhibitors, but by replacing thiolactone with thioether linkages the macrocycle is less prone to hydrolysis, a common decomposition pattern in similar inhibitors. Antibiotic resistant bacterial infections represent a major public health challenge. Each increase in resistance requires improving treatments and the need for novel pharmaceuticals. Anti-virulence strategies have been proposed where therapeutic agents are administered to interfere with production of virulence factors rather than directly killing the bacterium. This approach is considered advantageous due to its low selection pressure for resistance build-up and minimal perturbation of the host microbiota. The Quorum Quenchers (QQ) are a collection of macrocyclic peptides which are potent inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus virulence. Applications: Pharmaceutical Treatment, New anti-virulence strategy.

    "ip_description": "Researchers in the department of molecular biology at Princeton University have developed novel assays that use a targeted mass spectrometry approach to monitor viral proteins from all distinct temporal classes of a virus replication cycle within host cells. The replication of a herpesvirus in an infected cell and the spread of infection to neighboring cells relies on a finely controlled lifecycle with a temporally tuned cascade of viral gene expression. In order to effectively identify potential virus modulatory compounds, as well as gain an understanding of their impact on specific stages of a viral infection, we have developed a novel assay to monitor viral proteins from herpesviruses. This assay offers the accurate detection and quantification of viral proteins from all distinct temporal classes of viral replication. We have designed three assays for the specific detection of three herpesviruses: the \u03b1-herpesvirus herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), the \u03b2-herpesvirus human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and the \u03b3-herpesvirus Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV). These assays can be utilized in combination with drug treatments, genetic modifications, or other perturbations to assess the impact of the intervention on viral protein production. Given the temporal nature of herpesvirus infection, the acquired protein abundance measurements provide information regarding the stage of infection that is affected, the specific viral proteins that are impacted, as well as an additional mechanistic understanding of how a given compound or other perturbation impacts viral replication. Drug companies working on antiviral therapies or vaccine development can use these assays either as a primary screen for initial anti- or pro-viral activity identification or as a secondary screen to provide additional information on compounds that have been determined to impact infection through titer assays or other endpoint screening techniques. Compared to the current standard approach of a broad chemical compound screen with a reduction in viral titer as the endpoint, the proposed method is more efficient and accurate. It helps shortcut the mechanistic investigations by immediately focusing future work on a subset of the infection process. Other competing technologies used for antiviral compound discovery include mRNA sequencing, gene microarray, and western blotting analysis. In comparison, the proposed assays exceed these methods both in detection specificity and quantification.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers in the department of molecular biology, Princeton University, have identified a novel small molecule agent for the dispersal of P. Aeruginosa. Using an assay, called Dispersal of Initially Surface-attached Pathogens after Extract Lavage (DISPEL), they were able to isolate this molecule and using LC/MS and NMR they elucidated the structure and assessed the functionality of the molecule in being able to reduce bacterial growth and inhibiting a variety of pilis dependent phenotypes of p. aeruginosa. While the discovery of penicillin led to a revolution in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacteria, in recent years antibiotic resistance has become an increasing problem. Due to the rise of antibiotic resistance some scientists believe that drugs that affect bacterial virulence may be able to help treat disease while reducing the chance for resistance. One possible virulence factor studied by the researchers is the attachment of bacteria to various surfaces. It has been shown that the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa has reduced virulence when they are unable to sense the surface. The identified novel small molecule may be used to displace bacteria attached to surfaces. Surface attachment of P. aeruginosa is particularly problematic as surface association induces virulence and biofilm formation, which hamper later antibiotic treatments. Previous efforts have searched for biofilm dispersal agents, but there are no known factors that specifically disperse surface-attached P. aeruginosa.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Princeton University and Oregon State University have conducted a genome-wide SNP study and identified genomic regions under positive selection during the initial phase of dog domestication. Deletion of one of these regions in humans is linked to Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a multi-system congenital disorder characterized by hyper-social behavior. This study provides evidence that structural variants (SVs) of three genes previously implicated in human WBS are widespread in domesticated dogs and associated with human-directed social behavior. These canine SVs likely contribute to the developmental delay that facilitates ease of forming inter-species bonds and the juvenile-like hyper-sociability exhibited towards these social companions into adulthood.\n\nIn the absence of any background information about an animal, shelters use behavior assessment tests to make adoption/euthanasia decisions. These tests are necessary but flawed; the reaction of an anxious and fearful shelter dog may not accurately represent home behavior. Likewise, significant time and resources are often dedicated to training service and guide dogs with historically problematic placement rates (often around 50%) relative to the training received, with incompatible social behavior as a significant reason for failure. An early predictor of adult social characteristics is greatly needed. The characteristics of any particular dog are clearly a complex mixture of genetics and environment, but our technology can detect if there is a genetic predisposition for hyper-social behavior. This straightforward saliva-based test could be a useful and unbiased addition to the behavior assessment tools currently in practice. It could also be of interest to pet owners, as an addition to several commercial dog genotyping services. Finally, this technology could be valuable to breeders as a way to select for social behavior as easily as selecting for physical characteristics, or to assign their dogs an unbiased \u201cgenetic social score\u201d.\n\nApplications:\n\u2022       Assist in the prediction of social tendencies\n\u2022       Shelter and working dog behavior assessment\n\u2022       Assist in the identification of dogs for assistance training programs\n\u2022       Tool for breeders\n\nAdvantages:\n\u2022       Quick and straightforward assay\n\u2022       Unbiased by animal circumstance\n\u2022       Prediction possible prior to maturity\n\nStage of Development\nUsing our dataset of 837 dogs, 228 of which had paired survey-based behavioral data, we discovered that one of the insertions is the most important predictor of dog sociable behaviors related to human proximity, measured by the Canine Behavioral Assessment Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ\u00a9).

This technology functions by using an inner impermeable layer of material and an outer semipermeable membrane with a thin layer of disinfectant nested in between. The SARS-Cov2 pandemic has forcibly focused attention on the challenge of maintaining consistent daily vigilance with respect to contact mediated transmission of pathogens. Such contact involves touching a pathogen bearing surface followed by involuntary transfer to the mucosal lining of the nose, mouth, or eye. The standard advice is to wash or sanitize hands regularly to interrupt this transfer. While this course of action is correct, it requires constant vigilance and is likely to suffer from a significant failure rate under normal conditions. This self-disinfecting glove technology represents a significant step forward in our ability to mitigate the transfer pathway of pathogens from infected surfaces to exposed areas of the body.

    "published_date": "5/7/2020",
    "ip_description": "Surface contamination due to the accumulation of particles and biofilm formation causes fouling of surfaces and malfunction of devices that process particulate materials (e.g. water purifying systems and medical devices). Researchers at Princeton have invented a novel process and a method for improving existing processes for the separation of particles and water/surface cleaning, including showing a significant effect on bacteria near surfaces. The proposed method describes a new way to manipulate bacterial cells so to delay or reduce their accumulation to a surface. Bacterial cells have a negative surface charge and thus migrate away from a source of CO2, which suggests either formation of an exclusion zone, or slowed down (or no) accumulation of cells at the boundary. Therefore, the method suggests a material or surface design that can introduce CO2 dissolution to reduce particle accumulation or biofilm formation, by removing the cells by diffusiophoresis. Also, the method can focus or concentrate particulate matter including DNA, macromolecules, etc. to achieve charge regulated particle separation. Therefore, by tracking particles, we not only achieve manipulation of charged materials, but also indicators for particle surface charge, pH, and CO2 concentration in the system. Applications: -Delays biofilm formation -Water cleaning processes -Achieve anti-(bio)fouling surfaces Advantages: -Easy to implement -Useful in the systems with small length scales -A cost effective and environmental-friendly method that utilizes CO2 gas -Combine physicochemical and fluid dynamical effects to achieve directional motion of contaminants. The inventors have tested the method by using the CO2 sources with moving and fixed boundaries. Bacterial cells with different characteristics were tested for CO2-driven diffusiophoresis, and the inventors demonstrated that the bacteria removal in the vicinity of CO2 source is achieved for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and for both motile and immotile cells. Since most bacterial cells have a negative surface charge, we obtain a general conclusion that the method can improve anti-biofouling properties of surfaces near a CO2 source.",

    "published_date": "4/22/2020",
    "ip_description": "Bacteria harbor an immense reservoir of potentially new and therapeutic small molecules in the form of \u201ccryptic\u201d biosynthetic gene clusters. These clusters can be easily identified bioinformatically, but are at best sparingly expressed under normal laboratory growth conditions; their products are therefore not interrogated during bioactivity-guided screening exercises. An estimated 80-90% of biosynthetic loci are cryptic, meaning that routine bioactivity screens will miss the majority of microbial biosynthetic potential. Bioactivity-HiTES is a broadly applicable technology that allows access to cryptic microbial metabolites. It causes cell-wide induction of the secondary metabolomes of bacteria and links the resulting cryptic metabolites to a desired biological activity. In proof-of-concept studies, hidden antibiotics were discovered in four bacterial actinomycete strains, which do not produce antibiotics under standard growth conditions. Follow-up studies in two cases demonstrated the production of two new antibiotics: In one case, the taylorflavins, pyrimidine antibiotics that harbor selective growth-inhibitory activity toward Gram-negative bacteria, were identified. For example, taylorflavin B shows potent minimal inhibitory concentration toward Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Acinetobacter baumanii, but not against a panel of routine Gram-positive bacteria. In the second case, the lanthipeptide cebulantin, which is specific toward Gram- negative Vibrio pathogens (e.g., Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus), but does not affect the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), was uncovered. These compounds, taylorflavins and cebulantin, may serve as useful leads in the future. At the same time, Bioactivity-HiTES may be applied broadly to identify cryptic metabolites with the desired biological properties beyond antibiosis. Applications: Antibiotics Research, Drug Discovery Research, Increasing Titers of a Drug Candidate or Desired Natural Product, Metabolomics and Pharmacodynamics Research. Advantages: Access to Previously Hidden Metabolites in Bacteria, No Genetic Procedures, Facile, Rapid, and High-Throughput Capability, Broadly Applicable to Any Target with High-Throughput Assay.",

There are extensive studies of how electric gating affects materials\u2019 physical properties, but it is still unclear, in most cases, how electric fields/currents change the structures or conformations of field-sensitive soft materials, liquid-solid interfaces, and biological molecules. Researchers at Princeton University have designed a novel device that can provide external stimuli, such as electric signals, to cryo-EM specimens that change conformations in response to these external stimuli. The device consists of an assembly of two electrodes isolated from one another and from the frame of the sample preparation device by two 3D printed plates. The assembly mounting structure acts as the isolation for the electrodes allowing an electric field to generate across the sample preparation pathway. Conventional cryo-EM sample preparation approaches only provide fast freezing of samples. Our device expands the capability of cryo-EM by providing a voltage up to 500 V during the plunge-freeze process of cryo-EM sample preparation, thereby collectively allowing to induce and preserve conformational changes in the sample. The device has been tested and verified by connecting to the Vitrobot. The process is stable and safe, and does not interrupt the plunge-freezing process.

    "ip_description": "SLEAP (Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses): An Automated System to Measure Multi-Animal Body Part Dynamics. Analysis of lab animal movements is a key element in a variety of behavioral studies. The current standard for analyzing animal movement relies on manual video annotation, which is time consuming, mentally taxing, and error prone. Faced with these challenges, researchers at Princeton University have developed an AI-driven multi-animal pose estimation software called SLEAP (Social LEAP Estimates Animal Poses) for tracking individual body part kinematics of single or multiple interacting animals. SLEAP works with any animal or video by learning from as few as 10 user-provided examples of the locations of body parts of interest within the user\u2019s own video frames. Providing examples to SLEAP is facilitated by a turnkey graphical user interface designed for practitioners without any previous technical expertise. The system learns from user feedback through interactive correction of predictions, greatly reducing the time and cost of generating data for training a production-quality machine learning model. SLEAP can be configured to learn to locate the animal(s) within each video frame, detect their individual body parts, associate them with the correct individual, and track them across frames. The output of SLEAP are complete trajectories of body part kinematics, akin to \u201cmotion capture\u201d systems commonly used in film production, but without the need for specialized hardware, motion capture suits or body markers. This is a major improvement on other available software that provide generalized behavioral information, but lack full body position information. SLEAP generates accurate detailed descriptions of animal movements with the benefits of speed and facile operation. In addition, SLEAP\u2019s flexible AI architecture allows for variation in imaging settings by learning from diverse examples. The program has been proven to accurately track body part movements of a diverse set of animals including fruit flies, bees, mice, tigers, giraffes and more. SLEAP\u2019s inventors are seeking a partner to further develop the software and license to industry laboratories or other organizations. Applications: -Tracking of individual body part kinematics of multiple animals -High throughput analysis of animal behaviors (e.g., drug screens) -Development of disease diagnostics for animal models -Wildlife conservation and monitoring of animal well-being (e.g., agrotech).

    "ip_description": "Researchers in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at Princeton University have invented a novel process to seal underground fractures for geologic storage of carbon dioxide, and treat acid mine drainage simultaneously. Fractures play an important role in a wide range of subsurface processes, including but not limited to geothermal energy production, subsurface remediation, oil and gas production, energy storage, and CO2 storage. For instance, in the case of geologic sequestration of CO2, fractures can serve as conductive pathways for CO2 to leak out of the storage location, reach groundwater sources, and contaminate them, or even come to the surface, be released into the atmosphere, and cause significant financial losses. One way to securely contain stored CO2 is to seal highly permeable fractures in the geologic formation and abandoned oil and gas wells by inducing mineral precipitation. On the other hand, environmental contamination due to industrial wastewater production, especially Acid Mine Drainage (AMD), is a long-standing concern for many communities and states. AMD occurs during mining activities when rocks with sulfur-bearing minerals are exposed to water and air, leading to the formation of sulfuric acid. Contamination of water resources by AMD has not received nearly as much attention as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), due to no economic gain out of the treatment process, even though AMD causes the most extensive water pollution problem in many areas. The purpose of this process is to connect these two pressing environmental problems and introduce a new environmentally beneficial, economically feasible strategy to mitigate the leakage of CO2 from target storage locations while simultaneously treating industrial wastewater. The preliminary results from our novel approach show that while treating AMD, it is thermodynamically feasible to convert carbon dioxide into siderite, seal the fracture in which CO2 is leaking, and prohibit the migration CO2 from storage locations.",

When ratings are associated with differential time cost, scores correlate more strongly with objective service quality. Implementing this novel strategy lowers the sample size, and costs required for obtaining reliable, crowd analytic information.

Endowing a rating widget with virtual physics increases the time cost for reporting extreme scores obtaining more accurate crowd estimates. Implications include improving accuracy of evaluations in e-commerce, workforce review and development, and business development together with cost savings in fewer product returns and in reputation costs by reducing customer dissatisfaction. This approach can be generalized and tested in a variety of large-scale online communication systems. Present technology aims at minimizing client efforts in reporting feedback.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogenic bacteria that was responsible for 32,600 infections and 2,700 deaths among hospitalized patients in the United States in 2017 alone. Antibiotic resistant strains of P. aeruginosa are an increasingly prevalent cause of serious secondary infections.

    "ip_description": "Advancements in cellular imaging and high throughput sequencing have significantly increased our knowledge of microbial phylogenetic and metabolic diversity. However, it remains difficult to characterize cellular activities of most microbial species, especially low-abundance, slow-growing microorganisms. One such way to identify the taxonomy of single cells from environmental samples is through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which involves the use of fluorescent oligonucleotide linear probes targeting the universally conserved 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. However, 16S rRNA-based identification requires prior knowledge of the target organisms\u2019 phylogenies and provides no direct evidence of the target organisms\u2019 metabolic roles. FISH methods targeting messenger RNA (mRNA) in prokaryotes have been developed to relate functional gene expression within organisms to their metabolic contributions to biogeochemical cycling (e.g. mRNA-FISH and its derivatives). However, these methods are performed on fixed (i.e. dead) cells, offering only a snapshot of past activity in labeled cells based solely on the single target gene being expressed. It would be advantageous to use a method that targets metabolically active cells that exhibit certain specific functions, and meanwhile maintains their viability. To our knowledge such a method has not yet been reported.\n\nThe technology relates to fluorescent in situ hybridization of transcript-annealing molecular beacons (FISH-TAMB), a method that utilizes cell-penetrating peptides bound to molecular beacons to enter living, metabolically active Bacteria and Archaea and fluorescently label target messenger RNA (mRNA). FISH-TAMB can be applied to target mRNA of any functional gene of interest without discriminating against low abundance or uncharacterized species, and does not require cellular fixation, permeabilization buffer treatments, or secondary signal amplification. FISH-TAMB\u2019s chief advantage over traditional FISH methods is that it can be applied to living cells and not impact their viability. As many microbial communities researched by environmental microbiologists come from environments that are not easily accessible for resampling, the ability to maintain living biomass post analysis offers opportunities to further cultivate and characterize microorganisms that would otherwise be destined for biomedical waste.

Current satellite missions continue to improve the availability of information on hydrological processes, such as soil moisture, surface temperature, etc. However, their utility is limited by the large footprint of the sensors, which limits the direct application of these satellite data for field scale decision making. Researchers at Princeton University have invented a merging framework that uses hyper-resolution land surface modeling to efficiently assimilate and downscale coarse resolution remotely sensed hydrological processes to a 30-m spatial resolution over continental domains. It can be used to develop very high resolution remotely sensed derived datasets (i.e. soil moisture, evapotranspiration, etc.), or it can be applied to improve current monitoring and forecast systems of these variables. As a proof of concept, the researchers have evaluated this methodology for assimilating and downscaling microwave-based soil moisture retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission (SMAP). The downscaled dataset was evaluated against ~650 probes observations in the United States, and showed that the merged product captures well the spatial and temporal variability of the soil moisture dynamics, with overall improvement over SMAP estimates at the field and watershed scales.

Researchers at Princeton University have developed a novel process for mobilizing an immiscible fluid in a porous medium. An increase in the viscous pressure drop across trapped immiscible fluids in a porous medium can be achieved by locally reducing the permeability of the porous medium in the region immediately transverse to the ganglia with respect to the flow direction. This is accomplished by depositing colloidal particles to decrease the porosity and pore throat size of the porous medium to give a local permeability profile that enhances immiscible fluid mobilization. Deposition occurs by injecting a solution or suspension at a controlled flowrate or pressure drop to yield a desired concentration profile.\n\nApplications:\n\u2022 Tertiary or enhanced oil recovery (EOR)\n\u2022 Groundwater remediation techniques\n\u2022 Contaminant removal\n\u2022 Water filtration\n\nAdvantages:\n\u2022 Temporary alteration to the porous medium matrix that selectively reduces its permeability based on the distribution of the trapped immiscible fluid\n\u2022 Range of materials that can be chosen as the solute are wider than present techniques\n\nOne possible limitation of this process is that the permeability profile created within the porous medium through deposition of colloidal particle, may be irreversible. This may not be desirable, especially for applications in contaminant removal. Choosing solutes that have a weak affinity for the porous medium matrix and transiently bind would solve this problem. Another possible limitation of this process is that the deposition rate of solutes is not well controlled. The use of structured particles would help the practitioner speed up or slow down the deposition rate depending on particle design. By fabricating particles with a high affinity for the porous medium, the deposition rate could also be sped up.\n\nStage of Development\nThe inventors have made two suspensions containing polystyrene colloids that have a binding affinity for a negatively charged borosilicate porous medium and tested one injection process that effectively mobilizes trapped oil in both of these systems. They have also developed an analytical model that calculates the permeability as a function of the porosity, which changes due to varying amounts of the residual immiscible fluid and solute concentration over time and space, and the pore size, which changes as a result of changing solute concentration.

Daily diabetes diagnosis and monitoring remain arduous but urgent given that the disease develops and gets treated outside of clinics.

DiabDeep enables both an (i) accurate inference on the server, e.g., a desktop, and (ii) efficient inference on the edge, e.g., a smart phone, to balance accuracy and efficiency based on varying resource budgets and design goals. The inventors have demonstrated the effectiveness of DiabDeep through a detailed analysis of data collected from 52 participants. For server (edge) side inference, they achieve a 96.3% (95.3%) accuracy in classifying diabetics against healthy individuals, and a 95.7% (94.6%) accuracy in distinguishing among type-1 diabetic, type-2 diabetic, and healthy individuals. When compared to conventional baselines, such as support vector machines with linear and RBF kernels, k-NN, random forest, and linear ridge classifiers, DiabNNs achieve higher accuracy, while reducing the model size (floating-point operations) by up to 454.5x (8.9x).

    "ip_description": "A Genetically Humanized Mouse for Preclinical Testing of Specific Reagents Targeting Human CD81 and/or Occludin for study of B cell Lymphoma and Hepatitis C. The tetraspanin CD81, which is part of the B cell receptor complex, has emerged as an important immunotherapeutic target for treating B cell lymphoma. Researchers at Princeton University have constructed a knock-in mouse in which the second extracellular loop of CD81 was replaced with the respective human sequence. In this mouse model, humanized CD81 is expressed at physiological levels. Mice bearing the humanized allele do not exhibit any immunologic abnormalities. This mouse model has great utility for efficacy testing of compounds, including but not limited to biologics and small molecules, interacting specifically with the human extracellular loops of CD81. Human CD81 is also a receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) which causes chronic infection in at least 71 million individuals world-wide. Despite the introduction of highly effective and directly acting antivirals, the number of chronic carriers has not decreased and new infections remain high. Thus, the development of a prophylactic vaccine remains a top priority. It was previously demonstrated that differences in the amino acid sequences between the human and mouse orthologues of two essential host factors, CD81 and the tight junction protein occludin (OCLN), are responsible for HCV\u2019s limited ability to enter mouse hepatocytes. To study HCV infection in vivo, scientist at Princeton University have created a knock-in mouse in which the second extracellular loop of OCLN was replaced with the human sequence, which is critical for HCV uptake. Similar to the human CD81 knock-in mouse, OCLN is expressed at physiological levels. Mice bearing the humanized OCLN allele form normal tight junctions. Importantly, in mice in which both human CD81 and OCLN alleles are combined, HCV can enter mouse hepatocyte with an efficiency similar to that in mice expressing CD81 and OCLN transgenically or adenovirally. These experiments highlight the utility of the model for studying HCV infection in vivo and for testing the efficacy of anti-HCV vaccines. Applications: \u2022 Humanized mouse model to test human CD81 immuno-therapeutics against B cell lymphomas and related diseases \u2022 Humanized mouse model to test the efficacy of anti-HCV vaccines and efficacy of compounds interfering with uptake of HCV \u2022 Model to test human monoclonal antibodies binding to the second extracellular loops of CD81 and/or OCLN Advantages: \u2022 Only mouse model that expresses partially human CD81 and/or OCLN under the control of endogenous murine promoters \u2022 Established and well characterized model to study uptake and infection of HCV in vivo Stage of Development: The researchers have experimentally verified that the knock-in mice can take up HCV with an efficiency similar to that in mice expressing CD81 and OCLN transgenically or adenovirally.

    "ip_description": "Generating synthetic tropical cyclones is a general approach for assessing tropical cyclone hazards and risk applied by the government, wind engineering consultant labs, catastrophic modeling companies, and insurance companies. However, most methods currently in use can generate only storms under the observed climate conditions, as these models are simple statistical models that do not depend on physical parameters or climate variables. As climate change effects are getting more and more attention, there is an unmet need for a model that can generate tropical cyclones under future climate conditions to estimate future hazards and risk.\n\nResearchers at Princeton University have invented a new climate-dependent probabilistic tropical cyclone (TC) model to generate synthetic tropical cyclones (including their formation, track, and intensity) under observed or projected future climate conditions. This model utilizes advanced machine-learning techniques to establish comprehensive statistical relationship between storm features and most-relevant physical parameters. Given the statistics of the physical parameters in the current and future projected climates, the model can generate synthetic tropical cyclones under different climate conditions. The model consists of three components\u2014a hierarchical Poisson genesis model, an analog-wind track model, and a Markov intensity model. All three model components are dependent on environmental variables including the potential intensity and environmental wind and thus respond to the change of the climate.\n\nApplications:\n\n\u2022 When coupled with TC hazard models, can better quantify TC-related wind, surge, and rainfall hazards under various climate conditions.\n\n\u2022 Can be used by ASCE building code development, FEMA flood mapping, NIST, wind engineering consultant labs, catastrophic modeling companies, and insurance companies to estimate future TC risks.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\u2022 Better incorporate the estimated impact of climate change compared to present models.\n\n\u2022 The model captures observed TC climatology well and is able to reproduce various TC statistics, including the annual genesis rate, interannual genesis variability, and landfall frequency and intensity.\n\n\u2022 The model can generate a reasonable fraction of storms that undergo rapid intensification and\n\ncan estimate well the distribution of the lifetime maximum intensity.\n\nStage of Development\n\nThe model has been verified against observations using out-of-sample testing. The testing shows that the probabilistic model is able to reproduce various tropical cyclone statistics, such as the annual basin-wide genesis rate, interannual genesis variability, the distribution of lifetime maximum intensity, and landfall frequency and intensity.",

    "published_date": "8/27/2019",
    "ip_description": "Drainage is the process by which a non-wetting fluid displaces a wetting fluid from a porous medium. This phenomenon is ubiquitous, and arises in diverse settings including groundwater contamination, oil migration, gas venting from sediments, CO2 sequestration, mercury porosimetry, soil drying, liquid infusion into porous membranes, and oxygen accumulation within polymer electrolyte membranes. The ability to control the displacement pathway of the non-wetting fluid is critically important in all of these cases, but none of the current technologies in use can do so. Researchers at Princeton University have developed a novel approach to control the displacement behaviors by changing the geometry or the wettability of the porous matrix by injecting colloids or solutes that preferentially attach to the surface of the medium, creating a gradient of pore sizes or wettability. By controlling the colloids/solute chemistry and injection profile, this process will create a specific gradient of pore sizes/wettability that in turn changes the drainage displacement behavior to be either uniform or preferentially directed as desired. In the technology proposed here, compounds would be added to the fluid to change the solid wettability or pore size. The colloids/solute could be colloidal particles, a salt, or a polymer. A key advantage is that this would require a smaller of amount of additives, is economically more viable, and potentially would be easier to work with in practice. Applications: \u2022 Recovery of oil from a reservoir via injection of another fluid \u2022 Carbon sequestration \u2022 Mercury porosimetry \u2022 Entry of non-aqueous contaminants into groundwater aquifers \u2022 Gas venting from ocean sediments Advantages: \u2022 Smaller amount of additives required \u2022 Economically more viable \u2022 Easier method to work with Stage of Development: The inventors have a prototype to test that a gradient of pore sizes can control the immiscible fluid displacement pathway, and have also shown that colloidal particles flowing through a porous medium can deposit on the solid surfaces and create a gradient of pore sizes.",

    "ip_description": "Current anti-infective therapies against bacterial pathogens fall in two broad categories: vaccines and antibiotics. While vaccines serve in disease prevention, antibiotics kill pathogens after infection. However, since antibiosis creates a selective pressure for resistant bacteria, development of anti-infectives with anti-virulence properties has become imperative. Anti-virulence agents disarm bacterial virulence, thus preventing the onset of disease. Importantly, anti-virulence agents do not affect bacterial growth thereby eliminating selective pressures that can lead to resistance. Researchers at Princeton University have discovered a new anti-virulence agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an ESKAPE pathogen deemed by the CDC as a leading cause of nosocomial infections. This agent does not affect the growth of P. aeruginosa, but reduces or eliminates the production of at least nine well-characterized virulence factors.

This could also be very useful for potential electron microscopy-based high-throughput drug screening assays in the pharmaceutical industry. Typical electron microscopy staining protocols for biological samples consist of several steps in which a sample (e.g. a piece of brain tissue) is immersed in various heavy metal solutions. These heavy metals react with and bind to lipids, proteins or DNA and thereby stain these macromolecules and cellular structures. In thick samples however, it is difficult to establish homogeneous staining through-out the sample, mainly because of different diffusion kinetics in different regions of the sample. So far, the quality and homogeneity of the staining could only be assessed after the whole staining protocol has been conducted, including a final embedding step in an Epoxy resin. A typical staining protocol takes several days until the usual assessment by electron microscopy is possible. That assessment involves cutting the sample into ultrathin sections that can be viewed in an electron microscope, which is a destructive and very time-consuming process.

However, short wireless range in passive HF RFID and the need for battery powering in active UHF RFID pose major limitations. Researchers at Princeton University have invented a novel large-area RFID reader array technology using large-area electronics, employing zinc oxide (ZnO) thin-film transistors (TFTs). The device enables RFID readers to be fabricated scalably as large arrays on thin flexible sheets. The large and thin sheets could be used for lining everyday surfaces, thereby enabling detection and localization of objects bearing RFID tags. The above large-area RFID reader array technology is based on low-temperature processed thin-film transistors. This novel TFT topology enables high frequency operation and power transfer at RFID frequencies. Operation of this device was demonstrated with commercial ISO14443 13.56MHz tags, employing a tag-talks-first (TTF) protocol, to maximize readout speed. Using in-house fabricated TFTs, the 25-element array operated from a VDD of 4.7V, with readout speed of 5.5ms per element (set by the tag), and total power consumption of <70mW. Researchers have implement an RFID element and RFID array, using Princeton cleanroom facility. Full RFID reader operation is demonstrated. The device can be employed, inter alia, to enable IoT systems. It can enable smart interactive spaces, wherein human activities can be inferred from the placement of objects in the environment, which holds great promise due to the value it brings to machine learning algorithms.

YFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and has a fatal outcome in 20% to 50% of infected patients. Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, there is no specific treatment against YFV and recent reemergence events, especially in Brazil and Angola, have killed hundreds during the 2016-2018 period. This resurgence has occurred particularly in areas with historically low or no YFV activity and with low vaccination coverage, and have highlighted a significant risk for about 400 to 500 million unvaccinated persons worldwide. Furthermore, through international travel and human migration imported YFV cases have been reported in the Asia Pacific region, including China. These areas while home of the appropriate mosquito vectors and having the right climate have never been affected by YFV and are home to billions without pre-existing immunity to this virus.

Sequence-based models, with their scalability and usage of sequence dependencies, enable a new era of mutation analysis at unprecedented scale that can yield a new perspective on human variation in human diseases and complex traits. Researchers in the Department of Computer Science and the Lewis-Sigler Institute of Integrative Genomics at Princeton University and the Center for Computational Biology at the Flatiron Institute, a part of the Simons Foundation have developed data-driven models (ExPecto) that predict tissue-specific transcription levels for each gene in the human genome directly from 40kbp promoter-proximal sequences, leveraging sequence features learned from chromatin profiling data. ExPecto is capable of predicting expression-altering effects of any mutation with high confidence, across over 200 tissues and cell types. ExPecto was used to systematically predict likely expression-altering human genome variants, which were used to prioritize causal variants within GWAS disease- or trait-associated loci. The researchers experimentally showed that ExPecto predicted putative causal SNPs identified by the original GWAS studies, but not the lead SNPs identified by the original GWAS studies at three loci associated with four diseases cause expression-altering effects. The scalability of ExPecto allows one to systematically characterize the full predicted expression effect space of potential mutations for each gene, via profiling of over 140 million promoter proximal mutations. The resulting distribution of predicted mutation effects is informative of gene-specific evolutionary constraints of expression, indicating whether a specific gene is under evolutionary pressure for low or high expression in a particular tissue. Understanding such constraints on human gene expression could provide valuable information on deleterious impacts of gene transcription dysregulation in a systematic manner, which are otherwise difficult to obtain due to experimental limitations in humans, enabling identification of novel potential disease-associated non-coding mutations.

To date, heptafluorobutyric acid, perfluorooctanoic acid PFOA, 2,2,2,-trifluoroethyl nonafluorobutanesulfonate were defluorinated at 55% and HFBA was defluorinated 30% during a 2 week incubation period. A6 Feammox is also capable of treating a wide range of recalcitrant organic contaminates including halogenated and aromatic compounds such as TCE, PCE, benzene, phenanthrene, quinolone, ethylene dibromide, and potentially more. Trace Metal/Radionuclide Immobilization: The A6 Feammox process can treat a variety of inorganics because the iron reduction pathway is non-specific. As a proof of concept, the team has reduced U(VI) to insoluble U(V), Cu(II) to insoluble Cu(I). Work on selenium immobilization is ongoing. Applications: Environmental remediation: soil, ground water, waste water, chemical remediation, Ammonium removal, Organic contaminant treatment, Trace metal/radionuclide immobilization. Advantages: Degrade PFAS by defluorination to non-toxic intermediates, Low cost (anaerobic, room temperature process), Electrogenic (electrode-reducing bacterium): Can be engineered to operate iron free, Potentially scalable, Applicable to wide range of pollutants.",

The device uses plasma, an electrically conducting gas created by applying a voltage between two electrodes, to transduce acoustic waves to electronic signals.

The plasma microphone has high sensitivity that is virtually independent of frequency, a distinct advantage over conventional microphones that makes it ideally suited as a contact microphone for structural-health monitoring (SHM) applications. SHM utilizes spontaneous ultrasonic acoustic emissions (AEs) from micro fracturing in concrete and metal to detect, locate and characterize damage.

    "ip_description": "Fluorosis, a disease caused by chronic excessive ingestion of fluoride (F-) primarily through drinking contaminated groundwater, is a major health challenge particularly in developing countries. Excess fluoride may produce several health problems such as dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis and various neurological manifestations. Several remediation strategies currently exist, but they suffer from high operation and maintenance costs and/or production of secondary pollutants. Researchers at Princeton University have invented a novel apatite-based sorbent for defluoridation via synthesis and sorption of nano-micro crystalline hydroxyapatite-coated limestone. The nano-micro crystalline apatite, tested under several chemical conditions, has very high fluoride removal efficiency and does not affect water quality by any other means. Apatite is well known to remove fluoride, cadmium and lead from water. However, naturally occurring forms of apatite are relatively inefficient in terms of cost and their sorption capacity. This new method of making nano-micro crystalline apatite on calcite/ limestone surfaces is much more efficient than raw apatite in terms of cost, sorption, capacity and usage. The nanoparticulate apatite crystals can be made on locally and cheaply available limestone/calcite substrates, and are highly reactive due to their surface structure and high surface area. This rapid reaction ensures a high degree of reduction of fluoride and does not require a complex or expensive device. The granular hydroxyapatite-coated filter material may be used by itself to treat water or form part of a filtration apparatus.

    "ip_description": "Researchers in the Departments of Molecular Biology and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University have designed new methods to effectively inhibit the entry, spread and growth of bacteria. The entry of pathogenic bacteria into fluid-filled networks of the body causes serious infection and sepsis. In particular, sepsis is one of the most expensive conditions to treat in hospitals, costing more than $20 billion in 2011. Also, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of hospital-acquired infections, burn infections, and cystic fibrosis infections. Researchers at Princeton have discovered a mechanism by which P. aeruginosa invades and spreads through branched fluid flow networks that mimic vasculature. Additionally, they discovered that P. aeruginosa uses a combination of motility modes to move upstream, laterally and downstream on surfaces, enabling it to spread and grow rapidly in branched flow networks common to physiology and medical devices. This innovation describes a surface treatment, which combines surface chemistry modification and understanding the influence of the geometry of a flow network, to adhere and immobilize P. aeruginosa in liquid flow networks. It has been proven that growth and dispersal in a vascular-like network is inhibited by this treatment. The innovation includes suggestions for fluid network designs to inhibit flow-driven upstream migration of bacteria. As many other pathogenic bacteria possess similar motility structures, this process is likely to be effective toward a broad range of pathogens. This process can limit the spread of bacteria in healthcare devices and in human, animal and plant vasculatures, thereby reducing the potential for infection and sepsis.

To create more complex shapes and compositions, external machinery such as programmable valves have been incorporated to produce multi-compartment fibers (Kang et al., Nature Materials, 2011, 10, 877). In order to develop even greater functionality, researchers in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University have developed a microfluidic method to continuously produce microfibers with embedded droplets regularly aligned along the length of the fiber. Single or multiple emulsions are formed in selectively wetting microchannels, and are flowed into liquid streams that are solidified to form the drops-in-fiber structure.

    "ip_description": "Researchers in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University have developed a new device which monitors mechanical changes in a battery cell and predicts a battery failure event before it happens. Battery failures are commonly thought of as being unpredictable, arising from unexpected sources such as internal defects, adverse environmental conditions, and faulty controllers. Conventional battery management systems can identify the occurrence of failure events by detecting anomalous battery cell behavior using non-mechanical measurements of parameters such as voltage, current, and temperature. However, these conventional measurements lack the ability to reliably predict an impending failure event with sufficient time for preventative action, instead concomitantly detecting the event as it occurs. This innovation addresses this issue by using mechanical measurements to identify anomalous battery behavior indicative of a failure event before it occurs, allowing impending-failure cells to be safely removed from service. Some anomalous battery behaviors include lithium metal plating, internal short-circuiting, and gas evolution indicate impending failures that can be detected using mechanical measurements. These mechanical measurements can also be used to detect battery controller faults by providing redundant measurements of state of charge/health that can be cross referenced with voltage/current measurements of the battery controller. This technology can be combined with conventional battery management systems to provide higher-fidelity battery control and monitoring, and is compatible with common battery chemistries such as lithium-ion. The ability to predict battery failure will promote the development of next generation battery systems with higher safety and reliability.

It is written in Fortran 77/90 and currently has over 850,000 source lines. Dynaflow has been developed in an academic research environment which encourages innovation in approaches and novel solution procedures. It thus has many unique and versatile features.\n\nDespite large system capacity, no loss of efficiency is encountered in solving small problems. Dynaflow can be run on laptops, desktops and massively parallel supercomputing clusters (using MPI).\n\nDynaflow has an established reputation for being fast, accurate, stable and fully validated. Its many features and versatility have been illustrated by its applications to many varied challenges such as problems in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering (e.g., soil liquefactions), design of unusual foundations (e.g.,\u00a0 Ekofisk tank in the North Sea, Rion-Antirion cable-stayed bridge in Greece), design of Nuclear waste containing structures, reactive transport in cements, crustal plates subduction simulations, facture propagation in MEMS structures, mechanical and electrical conductivity properties of nano FGS filled polymers, microstructural failures in Li-ions batteries, optimum design of micro-structures for strength and transport, and Reservoir Engineering which is the focus of the discussion below.\n\nDynaflow is a general purpose finite element analysis program for the static and transient response of linear and non-linear one-, two- and three-dimensional systems in structural, solid and fluid mechanics. The term finite element in Dynaflow encompasses various discretization techniques, all based on a finite element mesh used to discretize the problem at hand, and include Galerkin and finite volume (both cell-centered and vertex-centered) schemes. Dynaflow has an extensive library of finite element topologies that includes 2-node lines, 3-node triangles, 4-node quads, 8-node hexahedra (brick), and 4-node tetrahedra. In Dynaflow, complex geometries and mesh configurations are handled by structured and/or unstructured grids.\n\nIn Dynaflow, there are no restrictions on the number of elements (cells), the number of load-cases, the number of load-time functions, or the number or bandwidth of the equations. Both symmetric and non-symmetric direct and iterative (CG and/or GMRES) matrix solvers are available. In both static and transient analyses, implicit-explicit predictor-(multi-) corrector residual based schemes are used. Advanced state-of-the-art Newton-Raphson, modified Newton and quasi-Newton (BFGS and Broyden updates) iteration schemes with selective line search (Strang, backtracking, line-minimization, etc.) options available to extract non-linear solutions.\n\nIn Dynaflow, a variety of techniques are used to solve the coupled partial differential equations governing the specifics of the physics at hand, each selected to yield optimum accuracy in solution. For instance, in Geomechanical-Reservoir models the stress equation is solved by the Galerkin finite element method (FEM). Various implementations of the pressure equation are available and include Galerkin FEM, cell-centered and vertex-centered finite volume methods. In order to be able to use equal order interpolants for both displacement(s) and pressure(s), Dynaflow has a unique Stabilized Galerkin FEM for the pressure equation. The saturation transport equation is solved by a Finite Volume technique (as is commonly done in Reservoir Simulators) with up-winding. However, the Dynaflow implementation is not restricted to cell-centered Finite Volume schemes as is commonly the case in Reservoir models, because of the need to interface with other vertex centered variables (e.g., displacements, pressure(s), temperature, etc.). Dynaflow includes a unique toolbox which allows use of Vertex-Centered Finite Volume schemes on both structured and unstructured meshes.\n\nDynaflow has unique multi-field/physics capabilities via selective specification of multiple solution staggers. In particular, Dynaflow has unique capabilities for solving strongly coupled multi-physics (e.g., stress and pressure equations), by computing the coupled Jacobian matrix by highly efficient elementby-element finite differencing of the residuals (without the need to combine the coupled equations in a new separate module). To maximize efficiency and memory management Dynaflow includes the capability to selectively allocate/deallocate solver arrays.\n\nDynaflow also has unique capabilities for slaving nodes/unknowns, for equivalencing nodes/equations, for imposing cyclic symmetries, periodic boundary conditions and multi-point constraints. Many of those require special unique procedures such as constrained augmented Lagrangian procedures which have important applications in Reservoir simulations for constraining well fluxes and bottom hole pressure production/extraction.\n\nDynaflow also offers eigenvalue/vector solution solvers (including determinant search, subspace iterations and various Lanczos algorithms).\n\nDynaflow has a fully documented user\u2019s manual (http://blogs.princeton.edu/prevost/dynaflow). Exporting results is handled by an in-house translator making available all aspects of reporting standards of industry and academia (e.g., Femsys_femgv, paraview [both vtk and Ensight6], etc.) and procedures are also available to export time histories of selected nodal/cell entities for visualization using Excel, etc.\n\nDynaflow has a free input format mode organized into data blocks with corresponding macro-commands and keywords, and can accommodate any userpreferred mesh input format.\n\nDynaflow has an extensive \u201cPDE\u2019s\u201d library (currently 85), and has an extensive material (linear and non-linear) library including many geomechanical material models (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb), relative permeability functions, permeability degradation functions as a result of shear, dilation and/or tensile stresses, etc. Interface elements are also available to model discontinuities (such as faults) and include contact elements, slide-line/surfaces elements with either perfect friction (including Coulomb friction models) or frictionless conditions XFEM options are also available for modeling faults (for both mechanical and/or fluid flow) in both 2D and 3D meshes without explicitly meshing the fault discontinuities. These unique features enable the user to model complex geological material behavior (including failure) and interface conditions in geological faults.\n\nDynaflow executables can be generated with selective specifications of either short (-i4) or long (-i8) integers for both single-core or multi-core (MPI) executions. Two MPI solvers implementation are available: one in which the master node assembles the global matrix then partitions its graph and scatters the local matrices to each slave for solution; in the other implementation the mesh is partitioned (using METIS) and each slave locally generates its own part of the matrix for solution.\n\nIn our most recent work, we have significantly expended Dynaflow capabilities:\n\n1. It now has the capability to model nonplanar faults in 3D including intersecting faults for both Geomechanics and fluid flow using very novel X-FEM procedures. The procedure allows large number of faults to be inserted in the mesh without explicitly meshing the faults in both structured (hexahedral) and unstructured (tetrahedral) meshes.\n\n2. It now has a new improved storage allocation scheme to allow up to 5.5 million cells (in 3D) in both serial and MPI implementations using short(-i4) integers. The new version is now able to solve successfully a large 3D test case with 5.5 million cells (over 15 million equations), and scales almost perfectly when using MPI (viz, on a single core: 1 hr 7 mns, on 8 cores: 16 mns). Dynaflow has a proven track record in providing reliable and predictive Reservoir Petroleum Engineering information by its application to challenging problems such as the Ekofisk subsidence, CO2 injection at In Salah, SAGD operations in Alberta province (Canada), etc.\n\nTo date, Dynaflow has typically been licensed in compiled form to protect its integrity and the tremendous investment and proprietary work product that 40 years and over 850,000 lines of code represent.\u00a0 However, Princeton University is willing to consider licensing of the source code, which would enable the integration of many of the powerful features of Dynaflow within a Licensee\u00a0 proprietary internal modeling software, and would give a Licensee a definite competitive advantage over other market participants. In our estimation the successful application of Dynaflow to even one substantial reservoir petroleum engineering problem would make the investment in the source code highly attractive on a cost-benefit and/or payback period basis.\u00a0 Any source code license would include terms obligating a Licensee to implement appropriate safeguards and guarantee that the source code remains internal to a Licensee.\n\nThe source-code license would be available on an unrestricted and nonexclusive basis for a one-time upfront fee based on either the number of sites where the code will be installed or on an unrestricted sites option.\u00a0 Princeton is also amenable to considering other business term proposals.\n\nProfessor Jean H. Pr\u00e9vost has over 40 years of experience in the areas of computational solid mechanics, wave propagation and transient effects in porous media, nonlinear constitutive theories, dynamic instabilities and localization of deformations in solids, thermo-elasticity, electro-magneto-solid interaction effects and finite element methods. He is currently doing research on topology optimization, delayed fracture in MEMS, cracks propagation in microstructures, and reservoir models for CO2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers. He has published over 250 technical papers in refereed journals and Conference Proceedings.",

    "ip_description": "Current laser systems are inherently brilliance-limited by the ability of the internals to resist damage by the laser. To overcome this thermal threshold, researchers at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory have invented techniques to improve the current laser amplifiers based on Raman instability in plasmas. A process was invented to use magnetized plasmas as the gain media combine counter-propagating laser beams. Using magnetized plasma to mediate energy transfer makes it possible to use pump lasers of higher frequency or lower intensity to produce output pulses with higher intensity and longer duration. In addition, to overcome challenges of preparing a high quality short seed pulse and synchronizing it with the pump, the researchers have replaced the laser seed with a plasma wave seed. This method can produce the same time-asymptotic amplified short pulse as if a laser seed is used. This would reduce the device complexity of ultra-high-power systems capable of producing exawatt discharges. One further advancement is the use of electromagnetically induced transparency in plasma to create a sharp wavefront from a continuous laser. It can also improve the signal-to-noise ratio of a short laser pulses with a strong pedestal above ionization intensity. The resulted laser pulse with a sharp wavefront can function as a high-quality laser seed for plasma Raman amplifiers.

    "ip_description": "The research team at Princeton University has demonstrated a novel and efficient method to encapsulate highly water-soluble biologic active pharmaceutical ingredients into nanocarriers using a single precipitation step. Nanoprecipitation of active pharmaceutical ingredients into drug carriers is an attractive method for producing formulations with improved nanoparticle stability and biological efficacies. However, nanoprecipitation techniques are generally applicable for only highly hydrophobic and water-insoluble active pharmaceutical ingredients. Currently, water-soluble biologics are typically encapsulated through water-in-oil-in-water emulsions or liposomal processes that require multi steps, suffer from poor encapsulation efficiencies, or exhibit low drug mass loadings. The team at Princeton University has demonstrated a new approach that enables formation of nanoparticles from previously intractable compounds. As a proof of concept, highly hydrophilic active pharmaceutical ingredients including gentamicin (LogP=-4.21) and polymyxin B (Log P=-5.6) were encapsulated. For polymyxin B, nanocarriers of 100-200 nm in size displaying release rates over 3 days were produced. Nanocarrier properties, including stability and release rates, can be tuned using this process. Further, the nanoparticle are assembled via flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) process, which is a continuous process that is similar to currently existing industrial processes, has been shown to be compatible for other formulations, and is currently being scaled up to an industrially relevant production size and rate. Application: Controlled release formulation for hydrophilic biologics.

    "ip_description": "Researchers in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University have invented a new spectroscopy technology that enables ultra-high resolution one and two dimensional spatial imaging of Rayleigh, Raman, and Thomson spectral features without the need for a spectrometer. The approach provides the capability for imaging of a single spectral feature such as a single rotational Raman line and the simultaneous elimination of background scattering. High collection efficiency provides the opportunity for single pulse time frozen images to be acquired.\n\nThis invention relies on absorption features in atomic vapors to \u201cslow down\u201d a specific spectral feature while absorbing or freely transmitting all light at wavelengths outside of the dispersive region. A photodetector is then time-gated to accept only the delayed light corresponding to the signal of interest. By frequency tuning the illumination laser, any desired spectral feature can be selected.\n\nThis represents a highly selective imaging technique for scattering features associated with gases, plasmas, liquids, and solids. It has immediate application in one or two dimensional imaging of a selected molecular species and imaging of a selected energy state of that species. It will provide significant enhanced capabilities for combustion and plasma diagnostics and can provide valuable information on non-equilibrium and transient phenomena. The time-delayed filter relies on the dispersion provided by the natural state of the atomic species in the filter cell without the need for optical pumping, allowing seamless integration with existing commercial devices.

    "ip_name": "A Device for Self-Myofascial Release of Lower Back Muscle Groups",
    "ip_number": "18-3411-1",
    "published_date": "3/16/2018",
    "ip_description": "Muscular lower back injuries are prevalent in most athletes. These injuries are a result of over-contracted muscle groups that are subject to rapid strains, causing them to tear. Myofascial Release (MFR) is an effective, non-abrasive technique that involves the application of pressure on certain specific points of the painful muscle. It has proven to be an effective method to mitigate lower back pain by releasing the over-contracted muscles back to a neutral state. Current treatment options consist of costly massage techniques or devices such as foam rollers that do not support the spine and can exacerbate the problem.\n\nA mechanical engineering student at Princeton University has invented the first affordable, easy to use, and safe device for self-myofascial release. The device is lightweight, self-powered, and can be disassembled using a single tool, facilitating transportation and use at home or on the field. Its modular design makes it easily customizable, allowing users of varying body weights and frame sizes to use it effectively. Pressures equivalent to those applied during deep tissue MFR can be achieved by using the appropriate rod-releaser system.\n\nThis device would be a valuable addition to any athletic rehabilitation facility. A working prototype has been designed in CAD and manufactured by the Princeton machine shop. The device has been tested by members of the Princeton athletic coaching community, athletic training community, and Princeton squash team.\n\nApplications\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Self-Myofascial Release\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lower back injury\n\nAdvantages\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Self-powered\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lightweight, easily transported\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Customizable for height, frame\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Supports the spine\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No expensive components\n\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Easy to use effectively\n\nInventor\n\nAbhimanyu Shah is a mechanical engineering student at Princeton University (class of 2018).

    "ip_description": "Princeton Docket # 17-3325-1\n\nHigh quality medical imaging technology has been one of most important developments in clinical care and personalized medicine. Pinpointing the source and cause of disease in a patient allows targeted and optimal treatment, saving time and money. Applying this type of imaging accuracy to the identification of bacterial pathogens and infection sites is a critical unmet need. Overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics is rapidly selecting for resistance, but the time required to biopsy and culture for species determination limits the use of targeted techniques. To allow in vivo imaging of bacterial infections, researchers at Princeton University have created a method to conjugate trackable probes to quorum-sensing (QS) molecules.\n\nQuorum sensing is a cell-cell communication process that bacterial collectives use to regulate group behaviors such as biofilm formation and the synchronous production of virulence factors. This process involves the production, release, and population-wide detection of extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers. As these molecules are highly species specific, a trackable QS probe can be used as a diagnostic to determine both the location and the identity of a specific pathogen in many systems. These probes can be fluorescent for surface detection, or radionuclides such as PET probes for in vivo medical imaging.\n\nThis method represents a significant improvement over other infection-detection strategies. Metabolic and white blood cell labeling methods struggle to differentiate between infection and inflammation. Radiolabeled antibiotics detect infection, but cannot determine the species responsible. In addition, using labeled antibiotics can contribute to the resistance that this method seeks to avoid. Targeted and limited use of antibiotic compounds is a key part of the war against resistance, and this technology is a novel method to quickly narrow in on the most effective\n\nApplications:\n\n\u2022       Pinpoint the location and identity of a bacterial pathogen in many systems including:\n\no       In vivo medical imaging with radionuclide or PET probes\n\no       In vitro medical or industrial monitoring with fluorescent probes\n\n\u2022       Multiplex probes from different species to identify mixed populations\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\u2022       Can determine species identity\n\n\u2022       Does not use resistance-cause antibiotics\n\n\u2022       Can also disperse biofilms, increasing the effectiveness of treatment",
