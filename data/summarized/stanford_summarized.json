    "ip_description": "Stanford inventors have developed a method to efficiently differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into nearly pure populations of human blood progenitors or blood vessel cells in a Petri dish. This method solely uses extracellular signals to guide differentiation. Current differentiation protocols usually generate impure populations of human blood or blood-vessel cells from hPSCs. These impure populations only contain a subset of the desired cell-type, which limits the practical applications of these cell populations. Moreover, these protocols are typically lengthy that they require weeks to complete. This novel differentiation system enables efficient and rapid generation of nearly pure cell populations from hPSCs. It can generate 60-90% pure populations of desired blood or blood vessel cells in several days of hPSC differentiation. This allows wide applications of this differentiation system in treating blood related diseases and in tissue engineering. Applications include blood or immune system diseases, recovery from chemotherapy or radiation, and blood vessel generation. Advantages include generation of pure cell populations and efficient and rapid differentiation.",

Targeted radionuclide therapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment, yet numerous cancers still lack safe, effective targeted treatments. The system xc- amino acid antiporter is overexpressed in various cancers, including glioma and NSCLC, and has been identified as a significant target. However, most radiotracers targeting system xc- encounter issues with high uptake in inflammation and undesirable tissue retention, hindering their efficacy and none thus far have been radiolabeled with therapeutic radioisotopes such as bromine-77. The inventors have developed a second-generation radiotracer targeting system xc- that can be radiolabeled with either fluorine-18 ([18F]hGTS13) for diagnostic imaging or bromine-77 ([77Br]hGTS13) for radionuclide therapy. In pre-clinical studies [18F]hGTS13 showed an improved tumor uptake in NSCLC rat models, and lower pancreas and kidney retention compared to [18F]FSPG, the most widely studied radiotracer targeting system xc-. Dynamic PET/CT imaging results further demonstrate that [18F]hGTS13 has a high and sustained glioma uptake in rats, making it particularly promising for glioblastoma imaging and treatment. In NSCLC in vitro studies, the brominated hGTS13 maintains transporter selectivity for system xc-. Hence, this second-generation hGTS13 radiotracer is a promising small molecule [18F]/[77Br] theranostic pair for high-grade glioma and NSCLC with favorable tumor-targeting properties, biodistribution, and tumor-selective cytotoxicity, and the potential to be applied to multiple other types of cancer.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers in Prof. Engleman and Reticker-Flynn's labs have created a novel cell therapy that targets the T-antigen, a prominent tumor-specific antigen, by leveraging the high avidity interactions between lectins and glycans. The therapy is designed to enhance treatment for patients with a wide range of metastatic carcinomas unresponsive to current immunotherapies or targeted treatments. The field of cancer therapy has seen advancements, particularly in immunotherapy, yet a significant number of patients remain unresponsive to available treatments. Identifying and targeting specific tumor antigens remains a challenge due to the possibility of cancer cells evading immune detection through immunoediting. Furthermore, tumor-localized immune cells are often insufficient, and a systemic immune response is necessary for effective anti-tumor immunotherapy. Current therapies have not adequately addressed these issues, presenting an unmet need for treatments targeting key tumor features, such as the T-antigen. The inventors have developed an innovative cell-based therapy that targets the T-antigen, a key tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen (TACA), enhancing the potential treatment of a wide range of metastatic carcinomas. The technology addresses the core challenge in current cancer therapies, where patients either do not respond robustly or do not have a durable response to immunotherapy. This solution incorporates a novel lectin-based targeting domain, leveraging high avidity interactions between lectins and glycans, yielding a robust anti-tumor response. This innovative therapy reduces the possibility of cancer cells escaping treatment and disrupts metastatic tolerance by targeting lymph node metastases. Applications: Cancer immunotherapy, Treatment for metastatic solid malignancies. Advantages: Novel targeting: First cell therapy to target T-antigen in a peptide-agnostic manner, Enhanced efficacy: Leverages high avidity interactions resulting in robust anti-tumor response compared to traditional therapies, Durable response: Targets functional mediators of disease progression rendering evolutionary tumor escape less likely, Reducing the metastatic capacity of the tumor, Metastasis disruption: Potential to target metastases and enhance the overall immune response to immunotherapy, Specificity: Targets aberrant glycosylation seen in tumors, reducing harm to healthy tissues.",

    "ip_description": "Hydrogen that is free of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is a key vector to fuel a net-zero emissions economy, but today's H2 is sourced from fossil fuels mostly by the highly emissions-intensive processes of steam methane reforming (SMR) or coal gasification. Water electrolysis, the only viable technology that can produce CO2-free H2 today, produces H2 at costs 3\u20134 times higher (~$4/kg) than SMR and will have difficulty achieving the target $1/kg H2 production cost target of the US Dept. of Energy H2 Earthshot. Methane pyrolysis is a technology that could reach the $1/kg-H2 production target given that the energy intensity of H2 production of methane pyrolysis is much lower than water electrolysis and given that the produced carbon byproduct can be sold to offset the H2 production cost. However, methane pyrolysis technologies have historically been stymied by catalyst deactivation via coking. With this technology, we developed a semi-continuous heterogeneous catalytic CH4 pyrolysis process to produce CO2-free H2 and high-value carbon consisting of the following cyclic steps: 1. CNT growth by concentrated CH4 pyrolysis in a fluidized-bed reactor 2. In situ CNT dislodging (i.e., inside the reactor) and CNT recovery and collection by vigorous fluidization with humidified argon. The term 'semi-continuous' is defined as a process that can run continuously without requiring cooldown of the reactor or removal of the catalyst from the reactor for catalyst regeneration. In a commercial process, this semi-continuous process would be operated in a continuous manner by flow switching between multiple reactors operating in parallel (pyrolysis, purge, regeneration, reduction, etc.). Applications: Hydrogen: ammonia/fertilizers, methanol, refining, steelmaking, fuel-cell vehicles; Carbon nanotubes: composites materials like carbon fiber, concrete, cement; structural materials, electronics, automotive, aerospace, sporting equipment, tires, rubber.

This advancement has significant potential in enhancing solar energy harvesting, night vision, cameras, and bioimaging technology. Triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) is particularly promising for these applications due to its low up-conversion thresholds and broadband, tunable absorption. However, current NIR-to-visible TTA-UC systems are significantly less efficient than their visible-to-visible counterparts. For example, the current best NIR-to-visible TTA-UC solid-state devices, made of PbS quantum dots and rubrene, are limited by (1) low absorption of NIR photons, (2) low energy transfer rates, and (3) low conversion efficiency, which restricts their broader application.

Inventors in Stanford's Engleman lab discovered that these types of tumors grow faster in mice rendered obese through a high fat diet. Because macrophages play an important role in diseases associated with obesity and are present in high frequency in tumors, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) may contribute to this accelerated tumor growth. TAMs in tumors implanted into obese mice promote tumor growth, since their depletion from these mice results in slower tumor growth. TAMs in the tumors of obese mice express high levels of molecules that blunt immune activation of macrophages (in contrast to macrophages in obese mice that are outside of tumors), and obese mice in which the genes encoding these molecules are absent do not display accelerated tumor growth. Agents that neutralize or inhibit the functions of these molecules are expected to have therapeutic activity against tumors in the setting of obesity, including monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, and genetic approaches including RNAi that can knock down the expression of these molecules. Conversely, since these molecules inhibit macrophage-mediated immune inflammation, agents that enhance the signaling of these molecules may prove useful in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",

The primary cause of this light scattering is the heterogeneous mix of refractive indeces within biological tissues. Several techniques have been developed to correct this refractive index mismatch by replacing low-index water with high-index organics or vice versa; however, these techniques often involve toxic reagents and cannot be used in live tissues.

Stanford researchers have identified T regulatory cell subsets CD39+ and CD39-. Populations of CAR-Treg cells are bimodal with respect to expression of the surface marker CD39, where the cytotoxic potential of these cell population depends on the expression of CD39. Selection for a CD39+ CAR-Treg population provides for a population with significantly reduced cytotoxic risk toward the cell population targeted by the CAR. Conversely, selecting the CD39- CAR-Treg subgroup can enhance cytotoxicity toward CAR-targeted cells. The CD39+ cell subgroup has potential to improved immunoregulatory function, which are useful in the treatment of autoimmune disease, to provide tolerance in transplantation, to promote wound healing or tissue regeneration etc. The CD39- cell populations on the other hand can be used for depletion of targeted populations, e.g. in cancer, depletion of undesirable antigen-presenting cells such as those present in transplantation rejection, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.",

Severe respiratory viral infections can trigger an aberrant inflammatory response that damages lung tissue and compromises gas exchange in the alveolar space, potentially leading to lethal complications such as respiratory failure. Immunoglobulins, comprised of Fc and Fab regions, regulate this inflammatory response, affecting the severity of viral diseases and effectiveness of vaccines. The Fc region is relatively constant among different antibodies in the same class, while the Fab region, also known as the antigen-binding fragment, is highly variable. Current immunoglobulin treatments for respiratory viral infections involve antibodies with Fab regions specific to the target viral protein, which limits their usage against different types of viral infections. Researchers at Stanford have shown that intravenous administration of immunoglobulin G with sialylated Fc domain, or even sialylated Fc ligand alone, helps preserve lung function after respiratory viral infection (Figure 1). The addition of sialic acid induces conformational changes that promote interactions with anti-inflammatory SIGN receptors. This approach can be applied against any viral strain, eliminating the need for adjustments when novel viral strains and mutations emerge.",

Quality control of gene therapy products is key to effective and safe clinical deployment. One hurdle to appropriate quality control is that most clinical AAV vectors do not transduce efficiently in tissue culture systems, making it difficult to measure titer and potency, which are important for quality assurance and dosing. Currently, the quality control of gene therapy products based on AAV vectors consists of determining the physical characteristics of the particles and a crude measure of \"genome titer,\" which does not directly measure the ability of the viral particle to infect cells. This can lead to viral preparation varying widely in their quality and potency.

Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a debilitating disease characterized by collapse of the femoral head due to an interruption in blood supply to mesenchymal and hematopoietic cells. Early diagnosis allows preservation of most of the femoral head through a procedure called core decompression.

An implant is then inserted into the drill hole to provide structural support and guide tissue ingrowth. To date, these implants have been porous scaffolds made of nondegradable metals.

In healthcare communication, there has been a dramatic rise in secure patient-provider messaging, particularly Patient Medical Advice Requests (PMARs), which enables patients to seek medical advice, request medication refills, schedule appointments, and discuss their health concerns directly with their healthcare providers. Currently, there is no effective way of sorting these messages without involving manual examination. Moreover, this surge in PMARs has introduced several challenges like the lack of efficient processing methods and workforce capacity to handle PMARs, leading to clinician burnout and inefficiencies in patient care. To address these critical challenges, Stanford researchers from Quadrant Health and Stanford's Healthcare Applied Research Team have developed an innovative AI solution using the BERT algorithm to automate categorizing patient-provider messages. BERT is designed to understand the context and semantics of text, making it highly effective at categorizing unstructured and multidimensional messages like PMARs. The model was trained on PMARs from online patient portals to categorize patient-provider messages into 12 distinct classes including medication, scheduling, paperwork, orders, results, data entry, referral, and review level.

Inductive heating is an established method for clean, efficient heating. However, an underlying challenge to date is understanding how inductive heating can be adapted to heat volumetric media efficiently and uniformly, which requires unique specification of the susceptor and power electronics. Researchers at Stanford University have incorporated a metamaterial mesh susceptor and high-efficiency electronics to create a sustainable thermochemical reactor that can produce a customized volumetric heating profile. Their invention electrifies the heating process by using magnetic induction to produce high frequency currents. The mesh susceptor in the core of the reactor can be tailored to support electrically conductive properties that enable high efficiency and uniform inductive heating within the entire reactor volume. This invention can assist in decarbonizing many heavy industrial processes. Applications include carbon dioxide capture, oil and gas production, steam cracking, limestone decomposition, cement and ceramic manufacturing, materials processing through pyrolysis, and hydrogen sulfur capture and utilization. Advantages include decarbonization, uniform heating at high temperatures, efficiency, high reaction rates, smaller size, lower cost, and scalability.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed tissue-based profiling by deep sequencing for detection of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) by tracking patient-specific tumor mutations in post-chemotherapy tissue samples, enabling a highly sensitive, molecular-level assessment of residual cancer. Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the U.S, with over 260,000 cases diagnosed annually. Despite advancements in treatment, more than 40,000 Americans still die each year due to metastatic breast cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is essential for shrinking tumors before surgery in locally advanced cases, yet current methods to detect residual disease post-NAC lack sensitivity. Pathological assessments and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) tests often miss microscopic traces, leading to undetected residual disease and undertreatment of patients. A more accurate detection method is urgently needed to guide patient selection for adjuvant treatments, inform targeted therapies, and reduce recurrence risks. To address this need, Stanford researchers have developed tissue-based deep sequencing for Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) detection, which offers a highly sensitive approach to identify residual cancer cells in tumor tissue after NAC. Unlike traditional pathology, which relies on visual examination, spatial-MRD (sMRD) uses ultra-deep sequencing to detect molecular traces of cancer across different regions of the tumor tissue, even when no residual cells are detectable under the microscope. In pilot studies, s-MRD demonstrated superior accuracy and sensitivity compared to traditional pathology, detecting molecular residual disease in resection tissues where pathology was negative but the cancer later recurred. With its potential to outperform existing methods, s-MRD represents a promising advancement for improving breast cancer outcomes and making it a valuable tool for global oncology care. Applications: Cancer diagnostics, Prognostic tool for personalized treatment, Companion diagnostic in drug trials. Advantages: High sensitivity detection of minimal residual disease at a molecular level, Personalized profiling of residual cancer, Alternative to manual pathology, especially beneficial in resource-limited settings, Adaptable to multiple cancer types beyond breast cancer.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have designed a novel tricuspid annuloplasty ring that minimizes the risk of interrupting cardiac conduction during implantation. Tricuspid regurgitation is a prevalent heart condition in which the tricuspid valve fails to close completely during ventricular contraction. The disrupted unidirectional blood flow could lead to abnormal pressure or volume overload. Patients with moderate to severe cases may require annuloplasty, where a ring device is implanted over the annulus around the tricuspid valve to support valve leaflets. While securing the device, sutures often inadvertently cross the bundle of His in the septum, disrupting heart conduction. To avoid this complication, there is a critical need for alternate annuloplasty devices. Researchers in the Woo Lab at Stanford have created a modular annuloplasty device that avoids suture placement in conduction tissue. Its most basic form is a C-shaped band with a wide gap between the two ends to avoid traversing over the septal leaflet. The device can be further secured by adding a flexible polymer that joins the ends of the device. Alternatively, the ends can be conjoined with a bridge-like structure that bends away from the valve. The bridge is angled to conform to the septal wall and aorta, improving retention. Applications: Tricuspid valve annuloplasty.

Mitral annuloplasty ring implantation is one of the most common mitral valve surgeries to reduce mitral regurgitation by establishing proper leaflet coaptation. Mitral ring sizing is a difficult process whereby a surgeon decides how much to reduce the size of the annulus while the heart is arrested. Methods currently do not exist to adjust the ring size once the heart has been restarted, and small sizing errors often result in persistent regurgitation, which requires the surgeon to re-arrest the heart and re-perform the annuloplasty procedure. To avoid exposing patients to this additional risk, Stanford researchers have developed an annuloplasty ring with a mechanism to adjust its size after the heart has been closed and re-animated. They used custom folding and semiflexible material technologies to enable asymmetric annulus constriction via sutures routed through the ring. The suture-based tightening mechanism exits the left atrium and allows for post-implantation adjustments based on real-time heart function.

State of the art manufacturing of integrated Ti:Sapphire technology relies on costly, size limited, highly doped Ti:Sapphire wafers which are limited in size, doping control, and uniformity.\n\nStanford researchers start using a standard, undoped, sapphire substrate, in which a near surface level Titanium source is created via implantation of or deposition.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted between humans and animals. Viral mutation and zoonotic transfer are anticipated to lead to future pandemics and largescale outbreaks. Indeed, the COVID-19 respiratory disease likely originated in bats, and led to a pandemic with over 750 million cases and nearly seven million deaths worldwide. To date, there are a limited number of active pharmaceutical agents that are effective at treating COVID-19 or other coronavirus infections in patients. There is therefore an urgent need for therapeutics capable of treating infections arising from known coronaviruses, as well as from new coronaviruses that will arise in the future. For instance, the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies was a major advance in the treatment of COVID-19. However, known mAb therapies gradually become ineffective with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. The inventors have developed improved fusion proteins containing an antibody domain, that binds a highly conserved epitope of betacoronavirus Spike proteins on the S2 subunit, and an ACE2 domain, which serves at the neutralizing domain. SARS-CoV-2 variants are less likely to escape the binding of fusion proteins than neutralizing mAbs targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins. Applications include use as a broad and high-potency therapeutic against coronavirus infections, fusion protein therapies which are likely to inhibit any betacoronavirus that uses the highly conserved ACE2 as a receptor, making them suitable for stockpiling in anticipation of the next betacoronavirus jumping from animals to humans, and use in high-risk patients with complex medication regimes. Advantages include greater breadth of protection than previously described fusion proteins, the use of fusion proteins with enzymatically inactive ACE2 (the virus' own host receptor), which prevents adverse side effects of administering fusion proteins with active ACE2 domain, more efficacious in vitro activity than known anti-coronavirus mAbs, broad neutralizing range that includes all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV-1, and expected to have few, if any, interactions with other medications a patient may be taking.",

These techniques generally use bifunctional molecules to recruit proteins of interest to either lysosome trafficking receptors or plasma membrane-associated ubiquitin ligases.

Self-heating in the channel of semiconductor devices degrades device performance and shortens device lifetimes. In this method, a thin polycrystalline diamond layer is deposited in one step both on top and around the sides of the semiconductor devices in order to remove heat from all three dimensions, with the lowest thermal boundary resistance of 3.1 m2K/GW. This represents a significant advantage over previous fabrication methods that take multiple steps and only remove heat from two dimensions. Additionally, this fabrication method has been demonstrated to significantly improve thermal management properties on GaN semiconductors without degrading performance.

    "ip_description": "Current methods of genetically-engineered cells require precise integration of genetic material. Genotyping is usually used to detect genetic edits; however, it's difficult to track the exact changes made in each individual cell in a large cellular mixture, especially when the cells receive multiple edits. While whole genome genotyping is available to track each cell in a mixture, the technique is expensive and time-consuming. Thus, there is a need for additional methodologies that enables quicker and cost-efficient tracking of genetic edits within cells of interest. The Fraser lab at Stanford has invented a genetic engineering platform that enables multiple cellular gene editing while tracking the exact edits being made. The invention consists of two or more CRISPEY modules covalently produced by the vector, where the combination of edits that will be made across all modules are predetermined. Each module applies edits of interest tagged with unique sequences that can be easily genotyped by DNA sequencing or other methods. When needed, the intended combination of precise edits for each can also be inferred by Sanger sequencing, NGS, or other detection methods. Unlike existing methods, the invention can be applied to a mixture of cells as well as single cell or clonal cell lineages, and provides an efficient, high-throughput, and low-cost method for genetic and cellular engineering. Applications include tracking relative abundance of cells targeted by a mixture of edit in parallel, such as high-throughput precision editing genetic screens to improve industrial microbial growth, select strains for improving crop yield, track edited cell populations treated by genetic editing medicine, and track edited cell populations used in-cell therapy. Advantages include a high-throughput, cost-effective method compared to existing methods, does not require integrating of vector into the genome, detection of the first edit (label) that installs the unique sequencing indicates that the edit tool is functional, and higher likelihood of the rest of the cells containing the second edit that is intended, important for isolating edited cells of interest. Edits made to the same target cell iteratively can be tracked by reading past unique barcodes installed into the genetic material. The barcode label can also be associated with antibiotic markers or other markers that allow cell purification.",

The significance of theranostics therefore lies in its ability to personalize and optimize medical treatments by tailoring them to individual patients. B7H3 is a transmembrane protein, that has recently been identified as a pan-cancer antigen with dense expression across a multitude of cancer types and with restricted expression in normal tissue, rendering B7H3-targeted radiotheranostics a viable treatment option for millions of patients. Despite the promise of B7H3, no peptide ligands have been identified. Furthermore, because the protein lacks structural and functional characterization there is currently no a priori way to design ligands. Stanford researchers have discovered B7H3-targeting peptides from peptide phage display that can be used for cancer theranostic applications, such as for diagnostic imaging and peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy. This would allow for both the diagnosis and treatment of various advanced or refractory cancers lacking other viable therapies. The newly identified peptide is the first peptide identified specific to B7H3, and when chelated to 68Ga and 177Lu, the first radionuclide therapy for B7H3.

However, further assembling and maturing the iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to mimic the mechanics of the native heart tissue remains a challenge. To overcome this challenge, studies have created microenvironments resembling that of primary cardiomyocytes during development: micropillar structures were placed to provide a 3D environment and exogenous cues were applied to facilitate anisotropic alignment of cells for coordinated contraction and electrical conduction.

Autonomous mRNA switches can provide dynamic regulation within cellular immunotherapies and offer broad utility in next-generation mRNA therapeutics, such as engineering chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells _in vivo_.\n\n_Ex vivo_ CAR T cell therapy has shown significant success in treating oncology patients and combating malignant tumors. However, this approach is limited by the expensive and time-consuming _ex vivo_ production process, which can take several weeks, and the challenge of administering only a single effective dose to patients, leading to potential tumor relapse. In contrast, _in vivo_ CAR T cell therapy offers a promising solution by directly engineering T cells within patients using mRNA therapeutics. This innovative approach enables rapid and customizable production, with the transient nature of mRNA therapies allowing for precise temporal control of therapeutic doses. Nevertheless, advancements are needed to develop technologies capable of sensing relevant biological conditions and tightly regulating the translation of therapeutic payloads. Novel strategies for controlling mRNA expression in T cells will enable the development of _in vivo_ T cell therapies that can alleviate T cell dysfunction while preserving the protective immune responses required for human health.\n\nNovel engineered UTR sequences resulted in RNA elements that can sense T cell signals and modulate therapeutic mRNA expression as ON/OFF switches. These mRNA switches have been shown to induce the translation of genetic payloads upon T-cell activation. The use of these mRNA switches to control the translation of a CAR in engineered T cells resulted in the expression of the CAR and the killing of antigen-positive tumor cells. Importantly, when co-cultured with antigen-negative cells, there was no difference in CAR expression or killing when compared to baseline.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have developed a novel kidney stone extraction device that can be used during ureteroscopy to simultaneously remove kidney stone fragments and dust without affecting renal pressure. Kidney stones are clusters of minerals and salts that form in the urinary tract, potentially causing severe pain from urinary tract obstruction, renal injury, or infections. During ureteroscopy, an endoscope is inserted through the urethra to break up larger stones with lasers or ultrasound. Fragments are either retrieved or, if small, allowed to pass naturally. Unfortunately, residual fragments and dust often cause recurrent symptomatic obstruction and stone regrowth. Therefore, there is a critical need for a more efficient clearance method. In response, vacuum-assisted sheaths have been recently introduced. However, they remove renal fluid along with the debris, necessitating fluid infusion to sustain the renal pressure. Stanford researchers at the Zhao Lab have designed a safer and more efficient kidney stone fragments and dusts extraction device that can be used together with kidney stone breaking devices. Their device is based on rotation to manipulate the flow and create a vortex that provides a localized suction towards the device to capture the stone fragments and dusts in the device. Unlike the vacuum-assisted device, this device avoids the risk of collapsing the kidney due to irregularly reduced intrarenal pressure. Stage of Development: Proof of concept \u2013 in vitro data.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have developed a method that utilizes specialized microbes to capture and convert dilute atmospheric carbon dioxide into reduced organic compounds. This innovative technology, capable of metabolizing CO2 at low, atmospheric concentrations, offers a promising approach to large-scale carbon sequestration, potentially contributing to global efforts to remove tens of gigatons of carbon dioxide annually by 2030. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a primary contributor to global warming, with atmospheric concentrations steadily increasing due to human activities. Traditional CO2 capture methods often require energy-intensive processes to concentrate and convert the gas, and there are limited end uses for CO2, reducing incentive for CO2 capture and limiting the large-scale applicability. Biological systems, particularly CO2-respiring microbes, offer a promising alternative due to their ability to metabolize CO2 at low concentrations and ambient conditions. Unlike energy-intensive chemical processes, these commonly anaerobic microorganisms can directly capture and convert dilute CO2 into useful organic compounds, operating efficiently in moderately alkaline solutions at ambient temperatures and pressures. Understanding the mechanisms of microbial CO2 metabolism and the conditions that facilitate it could lead to the development of efficient, large-scale carbon capture and conversion technologies. Preliminary experiments with the microbial CO2 capture and conversion system demonstrated successful production of reduced carbon compounds from indoor air. Importantly, the system consumed CO2 to levels below average atmospheric concentrations at sea level, indicating effective carbon sequestration. These results suggest that the microbial technology is capable of both capturing and converting dilute atmospheric CO2. Consequently, this approach has the potential to significantly contribute to global carbon sequestration efforts and transform climate change mitigation strategies by offering a sustainable method to remove CO2 from the atmosphere while producing valuable organic compounds.

In the prototype system, gas enters the reactor cell via a gas flow channel, flows over the gas diffusion electrode covered in copper nanoparticles and electrolyte solution at ambient temperature.

This approach offers a new method for ABI measurements, particularly useful for patients with non-compressible arteries, such as those with diabetes. By analyzing Doppler sounds, AutoABI provides a straightforward way to assess peripheral artery disease (PAD) risk without traditional blood pressure cuffs. The system could improve the accessibility and efficiency of PAD diagnosis in point-of-care settings, where quick and accurate assessments are valuable.\n\nAnkle-brachial index (ABI) is a crucial diagnostic tool for peripheral artery disease (PAD), but current measurement methods face significant limitations. Traditional ABI assessment requires inflating a blood pressure cuff while using Doppler ultrasound to measure blood flow in the tibial arteries. However, this technique proves unreliable in patients with non-compressible arteries, a common condition in diabetics with PAD. These patients often have medial arterial calcification, leading to falsely elevated and unreliable ABI readings. The prevalence of diabetes and the increasing need for accurate PAD diagnosis underscores the importance of developing more versatile, point-of-care ABI measurement techniques. An improved method that can provide reliable ABI estimates without relying on blood pressure cuffs could significantly enhance PAD diagnosis and management, particularly in challenging patient populations.\n\nAutoABI, a deep learning system integrated into a hand-held Doppler device, successfully predicts ankle-brachial index (ABI) directly from audible Doppler sounds without the need for blood pressure cuffs. This innovative approach enables ABI measurements in patients with non-compressible arteries, a common issue in diabetics with PAD. The device's on-board computer processes Doppler signals in real-time, displaying results on an integrated touch screen for immediate clinical use.

    "ip_description": "Researchers in Dr. Michelle Monje-Deisseroth's lab at Stanford have identified therapeutic targets for drug development to limit the spread of high-grade gliomas (HGGs). HGGs, including glioblastoma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, are a group of brain cancers with dire prognosis. They frequently invade a region of the brain called the subventricular zone (SVZ) and this spread correlates with decreased survival. Currently the only therapeutic approach to limit spreading into the SVZ is not optimal as it involves irradiation of the SVZ, which can cause very serious side effects. Thus, new targeted therapeutic strategies are needed. The inventors have determined that SVZ invasion is promoted by the secretion of pleiotrophin, which forms a complex with a group of proteins that acts as a chemoattractant for the glioma to the SVZ. Therapeutic agents that inhibit this chemoattractant complex, such as inhibitory nucleic acids, thus provide a strategy for treating HGGs. This technology provides potential new targets for drug development to limit the spread of deadly brain cancers. The inventors have identified pleiotrophin and its binding partners as key proteins secreted by cells in the SVZ that are necessary and sufficient for glioma invasion of the SVZ. Applications include drug development for new targets to treat gliomas and inhibitory nucleic acids (shRNA, siRNA, miRNA, ASOs) to treat HGG spread.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have developed PVSeg, a tool that automatically segments vascular and perivascular compartments in brain MRI data. This innovative tool can identify non-demented individuals at increased risk of developing dementia and accelerated brain atrophy. PVSeg's metrics could serve as a screening tool, allowing early diagnosis of brain microvascular issues and potentially improving patient treatments and outcomes. Additionally, it could enrich clinical trials for treatments targeting cognitive decline by identifying suitable candidates at increased risk of future cognitive impairment, thereby reducing subject enrollment challenges and decreasing costs. Moreover, in clinical trials specifically targeting Alzheimer's disease pathology (amyloid-\u03b2 and tau), PVSeg's metrics can refine the selection of participants with a 'purer' form of preclinical Alzheimer's disease by identifying and screening out individuals with radiographic signs of vascular damage, improving efficiency and effectiveness of clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. Finally, PVSeg's metrics are suitable for longitudinal assessments, allowing the evaluation of treatment effects on the brain vasculature _in-vivo_.\n\nCerebral small vessel disease is a significant contributor to cognitive decline and dementia. Currently, clinicians use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect signs of vascular damage in the brain, such as white matter hyperintensities and microbleeds. However, these markers are often subtle in healthy individuals and lack quantitative precision. Recent advancements allow for the measurement of brain vasculature and perivascular spaces using standard T1-weighted MRI scans. Yet, current techniques have notable limitations: they are user-dependent, leading to potential inconsistencies, and lack inter-scanner reproducibility. These drawbacks hinder the execution of large-scale, longitudinal studies and clinical trials crucial for understanding the relationship between vascular changes and cognitive impairment over time. There is a clear need for a more robust, automated method to quantify cerebral vascular structures consistently across different MRI machines and over extended periods.\n\nA novel, fully automated algorithm has been developed to assess perivascular diameter and count of blood vessels with MRI-visible perivascular space in white matter and basal ganglia using standard 3D T1-weighted MRI scans. PVSeg demonstrates excellent inter-scanner and test-retest reproducibility, addressing key limitations of current methods. Importantly, the algorithm revealed significant associations between vascular metrics and dementia risk, as well as brain atrophy rates, in a large-scale study (>10,000 subjects). By enabling more efficient screening in clinical trials, PVSeg has the potential to substantially reduce required participant numbers and to refine their selection, thereby increasing trial power and reducing costs in dementia research.\n\n**Stage of Development:**\n\n*   Preclinical _in-vivo_\n*   Continued research - Further clinical applications of the algorithm are currently being explored at Stanford.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Assessment of cerebral small vessel disease and its relation to cognitive decline\n*   Early detection of individuals at high risk for dementia\n*   Enrichment of clinical trials for cognitive impairment and dementia\n*   Evaluation of treatment effects on brain vasculature _in-vivo_\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   Fully automated segmentation of vascular and perivascular compartments in brain MRI\n*   Excellent inter-scanner reproducibility and test-retest repeatability\n*   Robust performance in longitudinal studies\n*   Requires only standard T1-weighted MRI sequences, enabling widespread use\n*   Potential for significant cost reduction in clinical trials through improved participant selection",

Magnetic shielding protects vulnerable devices used in automotives, aerospace and aviation, telecommunications, data storage, medical imaging equipment, high precision instruments, and more. Permeability, magnetic saturation, thermal stability, and operating frequency range determine magnetic shield effectiveness. Iron has excellent magnetic saturation and thermal stability, but can only be used in the frequency range of 100 Hz due to eddy current losses. Fe-Si and other soft metal alloys are typically used, which are expensive and difficult to process. The Stanford researchers' additive manufacturing (AM) method leverages space-filling curves to increase the iron components frequency range three orders of magnitude to above 1 kHz, without affecting iron's saturation, permeability, or thermal stability.

Current connectors are limited in its scalability. Superconducting coaxial cables have not been seriously considered for connecting qubits in neighboring dilution refrigerators because they lose quantum information too quickly at typical superconducting qubit frequencies (approximately 2-8 GHz). However, it is known that such cables are extremely low loss at low frequencies when the wavelength of light is comparable to the fridge-to-fridge separation. This invention enables qubits to be strongly coupled to the low-frequency modes of superconducting coaxial cables using a circuit that transduces quantum information from typical qubit frequencies down to a lower frequency, the so-called baseband, where the tradeoff between frequency-dependent loss and thermal fluctuations is optimized.

    "ip_number": "S23-250",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Of the 1.4 million first time mothers giving vaginal birth in the United States, approximately 75% will experience tearing of their vagina or perineum. During labor, the pelvic floor stretches to accommodate fetal passage, and overstretching of this relatively inelastic tissue can result in tearing and permanent injury. Up to 7% of mothers will experience the most severe form of tears, where the laceration extends from the vaginal opening all the way to the anus and rectum, damaging the underlying tissues. These severe injuries require comprehensive repair, and put patients at increased risk of post-partum complications such as infections, wound dehiscence, and pain. Patients with severe tears are also more likely to experience long term sequelae of their injuries including incontinence, prolapse, and dyspareunia. These result in ongoing follow-up visits, out of pocket costs, and in some cases additional surgical procedures. The prevention of perineal trauma during childbirth remains a significant concern for maternal health.\n\nEvidence suggests that applying heat to the perineal area can potentially reduce the risk of trauma by increasing tissue elasticity and blood flow. However, current methods for delivering this heat, such as conductive heating pads or compresses, present challenges in achieving safe and effective temperatures. Conductive heat can easily lead to burns, especially in the sensitive perineal region of patients that are often under anesthesia. Most available equipment is not designed to provide the consistent, controlled heat necessary to induce beneficial changes at the tissue level. The development of an ultrasound-based heating device specifically for the perineum offers a promising solution to these challenges. By using ultrasound technology, heat can be applied more precisely and safely, reducing the risk of burns while delivering the optimal temperature needed to increase tissue elasticity and potentially lower the risk of perineal tears. This approach combines both safety and effectiveness, addressing the usability gaps in current heating methods and providing a novel intervention for childbirth-related perineal trauma prevention.\n\nInventors at Stanford have developed a handheld therapeutic device that uses ultrasound energy to heat the tissues of the perineum. The device consists of a reusable ultrasound unit with a single use disposable gel pad which will be exchanged between patients and can be easily replaced if soiled. The energy from the device improves pelvic floor elasticity by 1) changing the viscoelastic properties of the underlying tissue at a precisely controlled depth, 2) stimulating blood flow to improve tissue's resistance to tearing, and 3) inhibiting neural pathways that lead to over-contraction of the pelvic muscles during the delivery. The device provides a low-cost therapeutic solution that ensures sterility, patient comfort, and ease of use at the bedside.\n\n**Stage of Development**\n_Proof of Concept_ - The device is at the proof-of-concept stage. Existing literature supports the efficacy of heat in reducing perineal trauma, and we have successfully demonstrated that our ultrasound technology can safely heat tissues at the required depth without causing burns. This establishes a strong foundation for the device's potential in preventing perineal tears during childbirth. Further development is focused on optimizing the device for clinical use.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Perineal trauma\n*   Maternal health\n*   OB/GYN\n*   Labor and Delivery\n*   Medical device\n*   Therapeutic ultrasound\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   No existing commercial solutions aimed at reducing perineal tears during delivery\n*   Precise control of heat delivery: precision targeting and controlled temperature that ensures an optimal temperature at deeper tissues without overheating the skin\n*   Non-invasive and safe\n*   Portable and user-friendly design",

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have developed a device to distinguish the molecule-specific signatures of diseased exosomes isolated from glioblastoma patients. The device is portable, disposable, and low-cost, enabling point-of-care assessment of disease. Classifying exosomes from patient plasma can be used as a diagnostic for rapid, sensitive, and non-invasive diagnoses of brain cancers. Glioblastoma detection poses significant challenges due to its complex nature and similarity to other brain lesions. Current diagnostic methods, primarily relying on MRI and biopsy, are limited in their ability to accurately distinguish glioblastoma from other conditions or detect early recurrence. The heterogeneity of glioblastoma further complicates diagnosis, requiring extensive molecular and histopathological analysis as per WHO guidelines. These methods are often costly, time-consuming, and not universally accessible. With a median survival of less than 15 months and a 90% recurrence rate, there is an urgent need for more efficient and accurate detection methods. Developing a rapid, cost-effective, and non-invasive screening tool could substantially enhance glioblastoma diagnosis, enabling earlier detection, more precise tumor margin identification, and improved differentiation from treatment-related changes. Consequently, a molecule-specific non-invasive tool that can provide comprehensive diagnostic information is essential to address these clinical challenges and improve patient outcomes. Using Surface Enhanced Raman spectroscopy (Glio-SERS) and machine learning to classify exosomes resulted in high specificity and sensitivity in glioblastoma identification. Importantly, Glio-SERS is capable of differentiating between glioblastoma and other brain lesions with high accuracy.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a predictive biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence post-treatment that provides key spatial distribution information about cell interaction. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common form of liver cancer and has poor five-year survival rates of below 20%. Early-stage HCC patients often undergo surgery to remove damaged livers as a means of disease intervention. However, the effectiveness of surgery is often counteracted by high recurrence rates, which can range from 50-70%. To reduce high recurrence, adjuvant therapies can be used in the clinic, yet these therapies cause severe adverse events in more than a third of the patients. One of the primary challenges of combating early recurrence is identifying reliable biomarkers to help predict patients who are most likely to experience HCC recurrence after treatments like surgery or chemoembolization. Prior biomarkers for HCC, such as gene signatures or protein expression, are limited in their ability to provide information about the spatial distribution of cells or how cancer and immune cells interact with each other. To address this gap Stanford researchers developed a novel spatial signature/ biomarker capable of identifying patients at high risk of recurrence with high accuracy. This predictive capability could enhance patient outcomes by making more informed selection of patients for risky adjuvant therapies, as well as enabling more tailored post-operative treatment plans. The technology is also designed to work with standard histology samples, making it easily integrable into current clinical and commercial workflows without the need for specialized equipment or processes.",

    "ip_description": "Among the many medical imaging modalities, CT and MRI scans are utilized most often for imaging bone and soft tissue respectively. As such, physicians often require both images to fully diagnose patients and determine treatment plans. To better harness these advantages, this work has developed a deep-learning model for creating hybrid CT-MRI images from highly sparse sensory data. The key component of this technology utilizes the assumption that each hybrid, CT, and MRI image can be reconstructed from a shared latent feature space. Therefore, the training set only requires a mini-batch of CT and MRI images each which is fed into the cross-modal auto encoder framework. Preliminary testing has shown that analytic reconstruction of just the CT or MRI images show large streak artifacts due to under-sampled data, but the hybrid image has high similarity with the true images. The degree of fusion between CT and MRI can also be tuned using a fusion hyperparameter allowing physicians to create the most useful image.\n\nApplications:\n- Treatment planning for radiation therapy\n- Hybrid image guided interventions (e.g., radiation therapy or surgery)\n- Effectively fuse different modality images: low-dose CT and fast MRI reconstruction\n\nAdvantages:\n- Higher image quality for improved diagnostics and image guidance: hybrid images preserve high bone contrast and clear soft tissue dynamic range\n- Creation of MRI image from CT sensory data, and vice versa.\n- Reduced human intervention in regularization term design",

Opioids are a powerful tool for pain management when used in clinical care settings. However, in recent years these drugs have been misappropriated for recreational use, spurring a public health crisis. In the US alone there were over 80,000 deaths due to opioid overdose in 2022. Naloxone has proven to be a key tool in the fight against opioid overdose by acting as an agonist of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). However, use of naloxone for opioid overdose has drawbacks, including that naloxone requires larger, repeated doses in response to more potent fentanyl.

H5 avian influenza strains are among the most concerning despite lack of documented human to human transmission due to their high mortality rates (40-60%). Currently available vaccines are unlikely to confer significant immunity to H5. Additionally, a large portion of public health resources every year are expended to create a seasonal vaccine for influenza viral strains that are circulating in the general population. Taken together, these facts point towards the urgent unmet need for a universal influenza vaccine. The inventors have created novel vaccine candidates for H5 influenza viruses. Specifically, the immune response to these vaccine candidates is directed towards specific epitopes that are conserved across strains and are less mutable than epitopes that are traditionally exposed. A modified H5 HA antigen is presented in a defined orientation via electrostatic interactions with the adjuvant such that specific epitopes are exposed and the immune response is therefore directed towards those exposed epitopes. This in turn will confer immunity to a larger breadth of viral variants. Experiments in mice with these vaccine candidates have shown that these vaccine candidates generate broad immunity to a number of influenza strains.

The immune system is an integral part of the human body's response to outside threats, including cancer. Specifically, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells have been shown to selectively seek and eliminate cancer cells. However, cancer cells have evolved several ways to evade this immune response, including downregulating receptors, altering tumor associated antigens, and changing the tumor microenvironment. High throughput genetic knockdown and knockout screens have been highly effective in identifying key genetic drivers of these mechanisms. However, these screens are most likely to identify factors that are necessary but not sufficient for a response. A need exists for new methods in identifying and isolating novel regulators of the cancer immune interface. The inventors have developed a method by which cancer cells are able to be specifically sensitized to enhance their elimination by cytotoxic lymphocytes. Specifically, the inventors performed a screen to identify factors which make cancer cells more susceptible to killing by CD8+ T cells. These targets were then overexpressed, individually or in combination, in cancer cells in order to sensitize them to cytotoxic lymphocyte killing. Targets for this sensitization also include ligands that can act in a paracrine signalling mechanism to induce cytotoxic killing activity in engineered lymphocytes.

Musculoskeletal disease incidence rates have increased in recent years in response to an aging population. Available therapies for osteoporosis-related bone loss are effective but come with significant side effects. As such, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects profiles. In a separate vein, stem cell technologies represent a new frontier in modern medicine. Indeed, human skeletal stem cell (hSSC) dysfunction has been implicated in musculoskeletal diseases, specifically in the context of aging. There remains a major unmet medical need for therapies targeting the re-activation of dysfunctional hSSCs in the context of musculoskeletal diseases. The inventors have pioneered a novel method for re-activating dysfunctional hSSCs in the context of disease or age related dysfunction. These researchers found that aged SSCs have lower bone-forming potential due to their lack of diversity via their skewed lineage trajectory towards fibrostromal tissues. Using a Boolean mathematics approach, they identified two factors that can re-instate youthful SSC activity in dysfunctional diseased or aged SSCs. Specifically, this method involves contacting stem cells with a combination of an inhibitor of bone morphogenic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B) and an activator of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling. Indeed, co-administration of such factors was shown to increase osteogenesis in mice. Applications include regeneration of bone due to aging and or disease.

The D-Lab chip-size spin processor efficiently generates one-handed circular polarized light regardless of excitation sources (e.g. light or electrical excitation), and detects both the circular polarization state and intensity of an incoming light at the same time. The integrated nanophotonic platform (figure 1) includes a high-quality-factor (high-Q) chiral Si metasurface integrated with a light-emitting or absorbing thin-film. The high-Q chiral metasurface is made of periodically arranged silicon 'meta-atoms' with a subwavelength thickness (i.e. 220 nm), Q over 2400, and a nearly 100-fold near-field electric field enhancement for one-handed circularly polarized light over the other. To demonstrate the photon spin processor for classical and quantum light sources, the D-Lab integrated the Si metasurface with a monolayer crystal MoSe2, transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) film. The resulting processor, free of bulky birefringent crystals, can generate valley-selective emission at room temperature with a user-defined chirality. Importantly, the light emitter can be photoexcited or electrically excited. Compact chiral light generation for both classical and quantum systems can greatly improve multiplexing of data streams, increase speeds, lower latency, and increase data volume.

Advantages: High performance: Multiplexing capability - A single chip (1 cm2) can encompass over 4000 processors (or pixels) with uniform or different functionalities, High spin selectivity - Integrated with a light-emitting or absorbing thin film, the metasurface reaches nearly 100% selectivity of one-handed circular polarization over the other, High spectral resolution.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have discovered that tumors increase the risk of atherosclerosis by regulating expression of a specific gene that stimulates angiogenesis and intraplaque neovessel formation. Previous studies have shown that cancer patients have a significantly higher risk of developing atherosclerosis than those without cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this increased risk have not yet been identified. Understanding the cancer processes that influence atherosclerosis is crucial for developing therapies to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disorders in cancer patients and survivors. Researchers from the Leeper Lab at Stanford University have identified a specific gene in aortic endothelial cells that is responsible for tumor-promoted atherosclerosis. By comparing mRNA expression levels in the aortic arches of mice with and without tumors, they found that this gene is upregulated in the presence of tumors. The tumor-promoted upregulation was also confirmed in cultured human aortic endothelial cells. The increased expression of this gene triggers angiogenesis and intraplaque neovessel formation, contributing to heightened atherogenesis and plaque vulnerability. An effective dose of an agent that inhibits this gene could stabilize, prevent, or reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation in cancer patients. Applications include RNA silencing products, neutralizing antibodies, and gene modification products. Advantages include no competing technologies and products targeting tumor-promoted atherosclerosis.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researcher Professor Fang Liu and her student, Greg Zaborski Jr., have developed a more uniform, reproducible, efficient fabrication method for moir\u00e9 structures in 2d materials that produces structures with cleaner interfaces, near perfect yield, and mass production compatible sizing (centimeter size vs current micron size). Created via precise stacking or 'relative twist' of van der Waals (vdW) layers, moir\u00e9 superlattices exhibit unpredicted and unexpected emergent electronics states, including superconductivity, making them attractive for a wide range of applications such as quantum devices, sensors, superconductors, ferroelectric memory, spintronic devices, and metamaterials. The most common preparation method (tear-and-stack of Scotch tape exfoliated monolayers) is inefficient, unreproducible, and suffers twist angle inhomogeneity, interfacial contamination, micrometer sizes, and a tendency to untwist at elevated temperatures. The Fang Liu Group fabrication method (see Figure 1) produces moir\u00e9 superlattices from a wide range of 2D materials with unprecedented uniformity and versatility, achieving much higher throughput and near-unity yield over centimeter-scale macroscopic areas, representing a significant improvement compared to conventional techniques. The target twist angle in homo twisted moir\u00e9 structures can be precisely controlled (either manually or through automated processes), due to the perfect lattice alignment of the exfoliated monolayer within the original van der Waals layered crystal. Furthermore, the macroscopic dimension enhances thermal stability of the small twist angle structures, preventing untwisting under high-temperature processes that are essential for device fabrications. Applications include Quantum devices Quantum communication and computing, Quantum sensors Quantum metrology and sensing, Flexible electronics, High-speed transistors and ferroelectric memory (F-RAM, FEDRAM, etc.), Spintronic devices, Metamaterials (optics, antennas), and Superconductors.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have discovered that treating colonized kidney stones with a cationic biopolymer effectively disrupts bacterial biofilms and reduces bacterial burden while remaining biocompatible with kidney tissue. Irrigating the kidney with this cationic biopolymer during surgery could serve as a novel method to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and sepsis in kidney stone procedures. Kidney stones are an increasingly prevalent urological disorder, often causing significant pain and requiring surgical intervention. Pathogenic bacteria are present in up to 40% of stones and can form biofilms which protect them from antibiotic treatments. As a result, stone surgeries can inadvertently disperse bacterial biofilms across the urinary tract and cause up to 30% of patients to develop a UTI and 15% to develop sepsis. Despite these known complications, little effort has been made to address this clinical issue. The standard clinical practice involves urine tests for infection followed by antibiotic treatment if the culture is positive. However, urine culture positivity rates are low compared to pelvic and stone culture positivity rates and intravenous antimicrobial therapies do not lower the risk of postoperative UTIs. Therefore, a new method of UTI and sepsis prevention during kidney stone procedures is needed. A cationic biopolymer has been demonstrated to interact with negatively charged bacterial surfaces, disrupting their membranes and inducing cell death through the leakage of intracellular components. Furthermore, the biopolymer disrupts bacterial biofilms, thereby reducing their resilience to antibiotic treatments. And, in the urinary tract, the biopolymer interacts with the urothelium, inducing exfoliation that expels and facilitates the eradication of highly resistant intracellular bacterial reservoirs. Treatment of colonized patient kidney stones with the biopolymer resulted in a greater than 90% bacterial viability decrease after 90 minutes. Importantly, histological analysis of human urothelium did not show any abnormalities or cytotoxic effects after treatment with the biopolymer. Therefore, the inclusion of this cationic biopolymer in saline irrigation methods during kidney surgeries can be an impactful preventative measure to decrease UTIs and sepsis in kidney stone patients.",

They found that inhibition of PTER, a key enzyme that regulates N-acetyltaurine metabolism, leads to N-acetyltaurine accumulation and a reduction in food intake. Therefore, the use of PTER inhibitors may be an effective way of treating obesity and other metabolic disorders.\n\nN-acetyltaurine is an abundant endogenous metabolite whose levels are dynamically regulated by diverse physiologic perturbations that increase taurine and/or acetate flux, including endurance exercise, alcohol consumption, and nutritional taurine supplementation. Interestingly, taurine supplementation has been reported to reduce mitochondrial redox stress, enhance exercise performance, and suppress body weight. PTER, an orphan body mass index-associated enzyme, was shown to have N-acetyltransferase/hydrolase activity and be capable of converting taurine to N-acetyltaurine. Genetic ablation of PTER and/or pharmacological administration of N-acetyltaurine in mice resulted in suppressed body weight and adiposity.\n\nIterative screening for and optimization of PTER inhibitors resulted in the discovery of small molecule inhibitors with a > 250-fold selectivity for PTER. Importantly, treatment with the lead compound caused an increase of N-acetyltaurine in mice and an acute decrease in food intake. Consequently, PTER inhibitors can potentially be used as a method of treatment for obesity and other cardiometabolic disorders.\n\nApplications:\n- Treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders\n- Energy balance and body weight control\n- PTER inhibitors can be administered as a therapeutic\n\nAdvantages:\n- Novel inhibitors of energy balance linked to taurine metabolism\n- PTER activity can be inhibited as a method of increasing N-acteyltaurine levels to treat obesity",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a method to overcome the packaging capacity limitation of adeno-associated virus (AAV) Vector CRISPR/Cas9 systems to help treat genetic diseases for which the cargo is larger than 4.7kb. CRISPR/Cas9 systems have gained momentum in the past decade as a fast, cheap and relatively targeted approach to genome editing. Adeno-associated viral vectors are commonly used to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 due to their efficiency, safety, lower immunogenicity and non-integrative features (i.e. AAV does not integrate into the host genome reducing the likelihood of Cas9 off-target effects). Despite these benefits, one of AAV's shortcomings is its relatively low packaging capacity of 4.7 kb which makes AAV's difficult to use for larger/bulkier cargo. To overcome this packaging limitation, Stanford researchers developed a delivery construct that increases the packaging capacity of recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors. The improvement creates new therapeutic delivery avenues for genetic diseases that have previously fallen outside of the packaging limitation of AAV's such as hemophilia A, cystic fibrosis, duchenne muscular dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt Disease, Usher Syndrome 1B, Miyoshi myopathy and more. The advancement also creates opportunities for current CRISPR-based technologies to incorporate the method to improve existing delivery mechanisms. Applications: Genetic editing of larger genes for gene therapy, Cell engineering in research & industrial applications (i.e. generating cell lines that require the integration of large DNA sequences).

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed Miro1 Reducer, a small molecule that targets the mitochondrial protein Miro1 to treat Glioblastoma, addressing the root cause of tumor growth and immune resistance, and demonstrating significant efficacy in reducing tumor size and improving survival in preclinical models. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, with an alarming annual incidence of about 16,000 cases and poor survival rate. Current treatment modalities, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and even cutting-edge immunotherapies, have failed to provide substantial improvements in patient outcomes. Despite the therapeutic promise shown by immunotherapies in rodent models, their translation to human patients has faced significant hurdles. Moreover, existing treatments often target the immune cells themselves but fail to address the core mechanisms driving GBM proliferation and resistance. There is an urgent need for improved or alternative treatments that target the root cause of GBM. To address this need, Stanford researchers have developed Miro1 Reducer, a small molecule targeting a mitochondrial protein to treat GBM. Mitochondria are crucial for cellular homeostasis and the tumor microenvironment, supporting tumor growth and evasion. Cancerous and adjacent immune cells exhibit metabolic changes including the transfer of mitochondria from non-cancerous to cancer cells, facilitating tumor proliferation. Miro1 Reducer addresses this by targeting the mitochondrial protein Miro1, which is key in these processes. By reducing Miro1 expression in GBM cells, this small molecule hinders metabolic adaptations and immune evasion strategies. In a pilot study, Miro1 Reducer has shown remarkable efficacy in the rescue of tumor size and improving survival in GBM mouse models potentially by suppressing mitochondrial DNA-dependent immune activation, preventing mitochondrial transfer, and promoting mitophagy. In summary, Miro1 Reducer offers a novel mitochondrial-targeted therapy for GBM, effectively reducing tumor size and improving survival in GBM mouse models. Applications: Oral drug that Glioblastoma patients can take to prevent tumor growth and improve prognosis, Targeted therapeutics and personalized treatment for Glioblastoma, Potential for treating Parkinson's disease and Friedreich Ataxia. Advantages: Currently, no effective treatments exist on the market for Glioblastoma, Miro1 Reducer addresses the root cause of immune resistance and tumor proliferation by targeting the mitochondria, unlike existing methods, which primarily target immune cells.",

The current state-of-art leverages electron multiplied or qCMOS cameras with millions of pixels and kHz of bandwidth, limiting the ability to simultaneously time- and space- resolve low light dynamics.

Targeting these epitopes for vaccine development could lead to effective vaccines for TB. TB is a significant global health problem that has been worsening in recent years with 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Despite the high mortality caused by TB, many individuals that test positive for TB have no symptoms and do not spread the bacteria to others. These patients have a latent TB infection and their immune system were able to successfully control the TB infection. Additionally, some patients have had significant exposure to TB and are not only asymptomatic but also test negative for a TB infection. This suggests that these individuals remain uninfected or rapidly clear their infection early on following exposure. The adaptive immune systems of these patients have likely targeted a TB epitope which is highly effective and ideal antigen candidates for vaccine design. A TB epitope that is recognized by CD4 T cells in patients that are naturally resistant to TB has been identified.

By repurposing FDA-approved drugs, this novel approach offers a practical and timely intervention for treating Alzheimer's and related tauopathies. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global health crisis, marked by the buildup of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) primarily composed of tau protein. A critical factor in AD progression is the propagation of tau protein, which drives the spread of disease pathology throughout the brain, leading to neuronal damage and accelerated cognitive decline. Current therapeutic approaches mainly target amyloid plaques, another hallmark of AD, but have shown limited success. This has resulted in a significant gap in effective treatments that can halt or reverse the progression of AD, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic strategies. The propagation of tau protein presents an untapped opportunity for developing novel interventions. Our invention addresses this unmet need by targeting tau protein propagation, offering a novel and previously unexplored therapeutic pathway. Stanford researchers have delved into the mechanisms underlying tau propagation and identified specific sequences responsible for this activity. Leveraging this knowledge has enabled the screening of a range of bio-reagents, which identified candidates capable of inhibiting tau propagation. Several of these bio-reagents are FDA-approved drugs, which opens the door to drug repurposing, a strategy that can significantly expedite the development and approval process.

Detecting lytic herpesvirus 6 in T cell therapies can identify patients at risk of encephalitis and assist in ensuring the safety of T cell products. Cell therapies have yielded durable clinical benefits for patients with cancer but have been accompanied by unexpected side effects. For instance, approximately 1 in 40-100 patients who undergo CAR T cell therapy suffer from HHV-6 encephalitis. Unexpectedly, the source of the lytic HHV-6 virus can come from the cell therapy itself. Therefore, the detection of lytic HHV-6 in T cell therapies can serve as a diagnostic tool to identify patients at risk of encephalitis and as a safety screening method for T cell products. Using single-cell sequencing, a rare polyclonal population of HHV-6 'super-expressors' (~1 in 360-10,000 cells) that possess high viral transcription and lytic activity late in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell culture were identified in vitro. Further, through the reanalysis of single-cell sequencing data from FDA-approved cell therapy products, the presence of CAR+, HHV-6+ super-expressor T cells were detected in vivo. Together, this implicates the T cell therapy as a potential source of lytic HHV-6 reported in multiple clinical trials and has broad implications for the design, screening, and diagnosis of unexpected toxicities in cell therapies.

FBR is an immune response in which detected foreign material is encapsulated in dense fibrotic scar tissue. While this response is crucial for protecting the body from bioactive foreign substances, it can be a problem when implants are intentionally placed in the body for treatment. FBR against these implants can lead to complications such as malfunction, infection, soft tissue disfigurement, and pain. Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) has been used as a coating on implants to effectively attenuate FBR, despite an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Given that ADM is expensive and not easily scalable, it is important to identify alternatives by uncovering its mechanisms of action. Stanford researchers have discovered that SPP1, upregulated by ADM, is necessary and sufficient for FBR attenuation. When a recombinant-SPP1-loaded hydrogel was placed adjacent to an implant, the fibrotic capsule was thinner compared to the conventional FBR. Additionally, the connective tissue architecture within the fibrotic encapsulation was comparable to that derived from ADM-coated implants.

Ultrasound imaging is a well-established diagnostic tool in medicine, due to its non-invasive imaging capabilities. While the performance of ultrasound imaging relies on the accuracy of the imaging parameters, these parameters are often empirically determined and remain fixed for a given imaging device. This reliance on fixed parameters can result in images of poor quality in situations where the initial assumptions fail and might not accurately reflect the underlying biological structures. This limitation hinders achieving high-quality imaging necessary for an accurate diagnosis. To address this need, Stanford researchers have developed a novel approach to ultrasound imaging using the differentiable formulation of the beamforming pipeline which adjusts parameters based on the specific imaging context. The software allows the system to learn and continuously optimize parameters during the imaging process, ensuring that the settings are always aligned with the current imaging environment. This approach differs from the static parameters used in traditional ultrasound imaging which is set for a given imaging device.

Ex vivo gene therapy is a powerful approach, which involves genetically modifying human cells outside the body using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and then reintroducing them into the patient for treatment of genetic disorders and cancers. Genetic modifications using CRISPR-Cas9 occurs by creating double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in DNA, repaired by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR). HDR is more precise but less consistent across different genomic loci due to the inconsistency in the levels of HDR activity, often leading to repairs by error-prone NHEJ pathway resulting in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Though DNA-PK inhibitors have been used to improve HDR efficiency, results are inconsistent across different human cell types. There is an urgent need for innovative solutions that enhance HDR efficiency in different genomic loci and cell types. To address this need, Stanford researchers have developed AZD7648, a novel potent DNA-PK inhibitor to enhance the HDR efficiency in CRISPR-Cas9 based gene editing across different genomic loci. By inhibiting the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a key component of NHEJ repair pathway, AZD7648 shifts the DNA repair mechanism towards the HDR pathway, allowing for more precise gene modifications.

Laser microdissection enables scientists to precisely visualize specific cells or small regions of tissue under a microscope and isolate them for downstream analysis. This is especially critical when analyzing specific cell types in heterogenous samples like tumors. However, available instruments for laser microdissection have significant drawbacks, as they are unable to reliably isolate single cells, are error-prone, and struggle with physical influences such as electrostatics. Additionally, such open systems leave samples prone to contamination and cannot reliably store samples for later analysis. Stanford researchers therefore developed an improved system combining laser microdissection with microfluidics. Cells are isolated using a laser and dispensed into buffer running through a microfluidic chip, where a system of valves sorts different samples. In contrast to systems that rely on gravity, this allows for reliable and standardized sample isolation. This also protects samples from contamination and enables their long-term storage. Additionally, a miniaturized format allows for cheap and easy integration into upstream imaging and downstream analysis workflows.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have discovered using a novel assay that a large proportion of CRISPR/AAV modified cells contain hidden concatemeric knockins that affect gene expression, and therefore developed a strategy to reduce their occurrence. The combination of AAV with CRISPR/Cas9 has proven to be a highly efficient strategy for site-specific genome editing. Typically, Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is electroporated into cells and induces a double-stranded break at a target site in the genome, while AAV delivers single-stranded DNA repair templates into the nucleus. The cell then employs endogenous DNA repair machinery to fix the Cas9-induced break using the AAV-delivered DNA as a template. This strategy has been used to make both small changes and large insertions in the genome, enabling both cures for genetic disorders as well as immune cell engineering for the treatment of cancers and autoimmune disorders. However, Stanford researchers recently discovered that a large proportion of cells (~50% or more) edited in this way contain target-site concatemeric knockins of the AAV genome. Critically, these concatemeric knockins greatly affect the level of gene expression but cannot be readily detected by commonly used assays. Researchers therefore developed novel strategies to detect these knockins as well as an approach to greatly decrease their occurrence. Preclinical: Researchers demonstrated a protocol to detect concatemeric knockins and reduce their occurrence by ~10-fold. Applications include improved AAV/Cas9 mediated precision gene insertions, treatment of genetic disorders (including sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, and epidermolysis bullosa), ex vivo cell engineering (including CAR-T), detection of concatemeric viral vector insertions and other complex genotypes, and prevention of concatemeric viral vector insertions.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed an innovative technology for cryo-vitrification using a temperature-controlled cold gas stream instead of traditional liquid cryogen, which prevents grid distortion, enabling gentle sample cooling and continuous imaging throughout the vitrification process. Traditional cryo-vitrification methods which involve a plunge freezing or blot-less deposition or spraying liquid cryogen on cryoEM grids for vitrification encounter numerous challenges, from grid distortion and damage, imaging limitations, complex sample handling, equipment dependencies and constraints on time-resolved experiments. There is an urgent need for a solution that addresses these challenges for cryoEM sample preparation. Stanford researchers have developed a technology which addresses these issues by simplifying the vitrification process. Instead of submerging samples in liquid cryogen, this innovation uses a novel approach which exposes the sample and cryoEM grid to a temperature-controlled cold-gas stream delivered via a cryo-nozzle, which eliminates grid distortion and allows continuous imaging before, during, and after vitrification. Prior to vitrification, the gas stream is blocked to prevent premature cooling. Upon activation, the cold gas rapidly cools the sample grid, ensuring efficient vitrification. Since the sample and cryoEM grid do not move during the vitrification process and not submerged in a cryogen, the grids can be continuously imaged using an optical microscope and exposed to various triggers for time-resolved measurements during and after vitrification. Additionally, the sample-grid can safely remain in the cold gas stream for other operations and removed using a specialized cryo-tong (also part of this invention) and saved for cryoEM imaging. In summary, this innovation overcomes the limitations of traditional cryo-vitrification methods, offering a comprehensive solution for advanced sample preparation in cryoEM research. Applications: Vitrify sample grids for successful CryoEM single-particle imaging, Preparation of sample grids for other techniques that employ rapid vitrification of samples for electron microscopy applications, Mitigates some of the problems associated with available devices for sample-grid vitrification, Facilitates extra sample manipulation and probing steps for time resolved CryoEM analysis. Advantages: There is not a commercial device currently available that specializes in time-resolved cryoEM, Grid Protection due to gentle cold-gas stream, Continuous imaging throughout the vitrification process, Flexible and simplified sample handling, Streamlined sample preparation workflow, reducing complexity and costs, Eliminates the need for specialized equipment and accessible to a wider audience.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have discovered BRP3, a novel peptide derived from the BRINP3 protein, which effectively reduces food intake and body fat in mice, while preserving muscle mass, thus offering a novel, safe and effective solution to treat obesity. Obesity is a major global health concern expected to affect over 25% of the global population by 2035. It shortens life expectancy by 5-10 years and increases the risk of death from diabetes, heart disease, and other related conditions. Current weight loss methods, including caloric restriction and existing weight loss drugs, often lead to muscle mass reduction, compromising overall health and physical function. Combination therapies have been explored, but no current treatment prevents muscle loss while promoting weight loss. Effective drugs that can reverse obesity without causing significant side effects, including loss of muscle mass, remain an unmet need. To address this, Stanford researchers have discovered a novel peptide (BRP3) derived from the human BRINP3 protein that reverses obesity without causing muscle loss. BRP3 is a peptide cleaved from the parent protein BRINP3 and detected in human plasma. When administered to diet-induced obese mice, the peptide BRP3 reduced food intake within 30 minutes of a single injection, with effects lasting up to 3 hours. Subsequent studies showed that daily administration of BRP3 in diet-induced obese mice led to significant weight loss by 10% and improved glucose tolerance, with weight loss attributed to a reduction in subcutaneous and visceral fat mass, without changes in skeletal or heart muscle mass. In summary, this invention introduces BRP3, a BRINP3 peptide, which combats obesity by suppressing food intake and body fat without affecting muscle mass, showcasing its therapeutic potential as a safe and promising anti-obesity treatment.",

Despite this, traditional methods are constrained by limited geometric complexity, slow speeds, workspace restrictions, inefficient multi-material printing, and lack of dexterity for printing. Now, using methodology commonplace in robotic surgery, Professor Skylar-Scott's team has developed a new 3D printing method that overcomes previous limitations. Their improved system allows the spouts to navigate through small and complex pathways, while maintaining dexterity as well as deviate from the traditional layer by layer printing.

Once this early window has been missed, the 5-year survival rate precipitously drops below 50%. Due to the current lack of effective screening modalities targeting early ovarian carcinomas, only ~15% are detected during the early stage--these lucky few cases are usually detected incidentally, during an imaging procedure carried out for unrelated reasons. If a rapid, cheap, easily accessible screening modality for early ovarian cancer were to be created, patient outcomes would drastically improve. Dr. Blankenberg and colleagues at Stanford invented a detection method using exosomes - small vesicles that are prolifically shed into the blood by tumor cells with molecular characteristics of their parent cells. Using vibrational spectroscopy in the mid-infrared region, the inventors distinguished ovarian carcinoma cells from normal controls. No other comparable screening technology exists, as current methods rely on prior knowledge of a specific protein or have difficulty imaging.

With these biomarkers, a more efficient and reliable approach compared to conventional methods (mainly clinical findings and gram stains/cultures) can be used to treat uveitis caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, helminths, or parasites. Instead of waiting days or weeks for laboratory results to determine microbial content, use of biomarkers to identify the etiology of uveitis is faster, more accurate, and more reliable. Particularly in ocular inflammatory cases, waiting for the correct diagnosis and treatment (50% of cases are idiopathic) can cause visual impairment, and ultimately blindness due to the recurrent and chronic nature of the disease process. Proteomic analysis was used to characterize the molecular profiles of the inflamed vitreous by taking biopsies from patients with various vitreoretinal diseases. This technique allowed researchers to identify characteristic protein signatures relating to infectious endophthalmitis and non-infectious uveitis in a mass spectrometry-based screen.\n\n**Figure Description:** Proteomic profiles differ between classes of infectious endophthalmitis: (A) Hierarchal clustering of proteins differentially expressed in our infectious endophthalmitis samples (all classes) compared to normal controls (ERM). Results are represented as a heatmap and display protein expression levels on a logarithmic scale. Orange = high expression. Dark green/black = low or no expression.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed an innovative AI-driven solution for predicting immunotherapy response in esophagogastric cancer patients. By leveraging deep learning models and single-cell analysis, this method identifies robust biomarkers associated with treatment outcomes. Esophagogastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, posing a significant health concern. While immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is the standard of care and has shown remarkable efficacy, its benefits vary widely among patients. Many patients fail to experience benefits from these expensive treatments, highlighting the urgent need for reliable predictive biomarkers. Existing biomarker tests like PD-L1 immunohistochemistry suffer from inaccuracies and high variability, leaving patients to endure ineffective treatments, toxic side effects, and financial strain. This discrepancy underscores a critical challenge and highlights a urgent need for reliable biomarkers for predicting immunotherapy treatment response. To address this problem, Stanford researchers have developed an innovative AI-driven solution for predicting immunotherapy response in esophagogastric cancer patients. By conducting single-cell analysis of standard histopathology images from immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated patients, this methodology accurately forecasts treatment outcomes. By leveraging deep learning models and fully automated cell annotation, this approach provides a comprehensive analysis of the tumor microenvironment, including cell density, composition, and spatial interactions, thereby identifying robust biomarkers associated with treatment outcomes. In a study of 82 advanced esophagogastric cancer patients, this approach demonstrated significant predictive power, highlighting its potential for personalized cancer treatment. In summary, this innovation represents a transformative leap in immunotherapy selection, offering personalized treatments for patients suffering from cancer. Applications include discovery of reliable biomarkers for predicting patient response to immunotherapy, selecting the right patients that will benefit from specific immunotherapies, guiding immunotherapy treatment decisions for clinicians and improving patient outcomes, significant cost effectiveness from selecting the right patients for immunotherapy, optimization of patient selection in clinical trials, biomarker-directed treatment strategies, improving cancer survival outcomes by avoiding ineffective and toxic therapies, and companion diagnostics in cancer immunotherapy. Advantages include significantly improving upon existing immunotherapy predictive biomarkers, utilizing standard diagnostic histopathology slides for increased accessibility and cost-effectiveness, single-cell spatial analysis approach providing high-resolution biologically interpretable insights into the tumor microenvironment at the cellular level using H&E slides, computational approach providing deeper insights into tumor microenvironment, avoiding overfitting and generalizable, unlike existing black box models, mitigating ineffective treatments and reducing toxicity risks, and alleviating financial burdens for immunotherapy treated patients.",

Mechanical forces regulate many important biological processes from stem cell differentiation to digestion. Tracking these forces and measuring pressures in an in-vivo or in-vitro microenvironment could help identify the cause of high blood pressure or other health anomalies. However, taking such measurements can be an invasive process, including the need for connective devices with wires and other conduits. The passage of such wires into an organism can create opportunities for infection and they often need to be removed once the measurements are complete. Thus, there is a need in the art for improved force and/or pressure measurement sensors that can operate without the need for an external connection or power supply. The inventors have developed force measurement devices that can operate without an external connection or power supply using a force sensor that entails upconverting nanoparticles in a host structure. The force sensors are positioned within an organism at locations where a force or pressure is applied, and the force sensors provide an output that can be used to measure and track forces applied by the organism. Applications include uncovering novel biomarkers of disease that go undetected with traditional chemical, optical and electrical sensing modalities, measuring force between an immune cell and an antigen presenting cell, and diagnostics or determining treatment efficacy. Advantages include overcoming disadvantages of other existing mechanosensing tools such as atomic force microscopy or traction force microscopy which are too large and invasive to operate in-vivo, or FRET which is limited in dynamic range and the propensity to rapidly photobleach.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed methods for preparing chromatin from cells for downstream genomic chromatin mapping. Chromatin profiling strategies are widely used to map the genomic location of chromatin elements, such as histone post-translational modification and chromatin associated proteins. Though there are various different techniques to perform this profiling, they each tend to suffer from the same drawbacks, which limit their utility under certain conditions. For instance, some assays include incubating permeabilized cells with enzymes, where the nuclear envelope retains the chromatin structure and interacting biomolecules. However, this precludes anucleated cells, such as bacteria, or in cells undergoing cell division. In addition, substantial wash and centrifugation steps can introduce unwanted variability and produce negative impacts on chromatin quality that can hamper downstream analysis. Therefore, there is a need in the art for improved methods for sample preparation for chromatin mapping with lower starting material, minimal handling steps, and a non-reliance on the nuclear membrane. The inventors have developed a single vessel (i.e. a \"one-pot\") method for preparing samples for genome wide mapping of protein-DNA interactions. Compatible workflows can include DiMeLo-seq, or other methods such as CUT&RUN or CUT&TAG. In this method, wash steps have been replaced with a series of dilution and/or precipitation steps that enable addition of components that would otherwise interfere with downstream workflow steps above a certain concentration.

Due to their desirable band gaps and high absorption coefficient, TMDs are promising for next generation, high specific power solar cells. Current TMD fabrication methods rely on exfoliating small flakes from a bulk TMD crystal, which does not produce full, mass production friendly, multi-layer films. The Pop Lab deposited wafer-scale, multilayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) films by selenizing pre-deposited, pre-patterned tungsten with solid source selenium and H2Se precursors (See Fig. 1). These WSe2 films yield a charge carrier lifetime of up to 144 ns, corresponding to power conversion efficiency of ~22% and specific power of ~64 W g-1 in a packaged solar cell, and ~3 W g-1 in a fully packaged solar module. Initial focus was WSe2, but the method could be applied to sulfur (instead of selenium), and other transition metals or even other transition metal oxides (e.g. WSe2, WS2, MoSe2, MoS2). This breakthrough could pave the way for mass-production of low cost, high-efficiency, lightweight, flexible, multilayer WSe2 (and other TMD) solar cells that are capable of irregular shapes like a drone wing, car roof, or wearable devices. Alternatively, layered TMDs could be used as contact layers for CdTe and CIGS solar cells.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a new gene editing approach that enables red blood cell-specific gene expression for the treatment of enzyme deficiencies. Available protein-based enzyme replacement therapies are not curative, require frequent infusions, and often become less effective over time. Similarly, emerging strategies that use a viral vector to deliver a functional copy of the defective gene to the liver are limited by pre-existing neutralizing antibodies, potentially life-threatening immune responses, and a decline in enzyme production over time. Researchers therefore developed a new strategy in which red blood cells are turned into enzyme-producing factories, taking advantage of the fact that red blood cells are produced in large numbers and circulate throughout the body. To achieve red blood cell specific gene expression, researchers use _ex vivo_ CRISPR/Cas editing of hematopoietic stem cells to insert a functional copy of the enzyme behind a promoter (HBA1 or HBA2) that is only active in red blood cells. Scientists further optimized this strategy for the treatment of hemophilia B, caused by mutations in factor IX. They increased the amount of factor IX secreted into the bloodstream by over 3-fold and engineered the protein to be 3.3-fold more active. Stage of development: Animal data: treatment of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency and hemophilia B in mice. Applications: Treatment of intracellular enzyme deficiencies, _e.g._ phenylketonuria; Treatment of extracellular enzyme deficiencies, _e.g._ hemophilia A and B. Advantages: One-time cure; Redundancy of HBA1 and HBA2 means that red blood cell function is not affected; Red blood cell specific gene expression prevents effects on other blood cell function; Approach is agnostic to specific genetic mutations; Minimal risk of insertional mutagenesis; Avoids immune response associated with _in vivo_ therapies; Effective even at low levels of engraftment, allowing for minimally toxic conditioning; Improved factor IX secretion (3-fold); Improved factor IX activity (3.3-fold over Padua variant currently used in clinical trials).",

MAPs are an innovative transdermal drug delivery system that allows for relatively painless, efficient, and controlled administration of medications through the skin. They are composed of an adhesive backing and an array of drug-eluting microneedles. Additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, is emerging as the preferred fabrication method for MAPs because it offers more design options and capabilities compared to the conventional silicon microfabrication method. However, the materials currently used to 3D print MAPs have limited printing resolution, are often too soft for complete insertion into the skin, and lose biocompatibility with wear. To overcome these limitations, Stanford researchers used a pyrolytic polymer to manufacture MAPs. They 3D printed the desired micro-array structure using a soft pyrolytic polymer. The printed structure was then subjected to pyrolysis, a thermal decomposition process, to form a miniaturized replica made of hard monolithic carbon. These steps ensured both high-resolution structural details and enhanced mechanical strength and stability, facilitating skin insertion and drug release. Additionally, high electrical conductivity of these MAPs enabled their use in electrochemical sensing.",

Timothy Syndrome is a severe developmental disorder that causes long QT syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, syndactyly and immune dysfunction. While scientists have discovered the genetic basis for the disorder in many patients (mutations in exon 8A of the calcium channel CACNA1C), there are no available treatments that act on this root cause. Researchers therefore developed a treatment strategy to modulate the splicing of CACNA1C. Using human cortical spheroids derived from patient cells, they screened a series of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to identify one that biases pre-mRNA splicing to include the healthy exon 8 instead of the mutated exon 8A. Scientists showed that this candidate could restore calcium defects in patient-derived cortical neurons, influence interneuron migration, and restore activity-dependent dendritic retraction in transplanted cortical organoids. This ASO therefore has significant promise for the treatment of Timothy syndrome. Stage of Development: In vitro: selectively causes mutagenic exon 8A exclusion in patient-derived cortical organoids, restores calcium defects in patient-derived cortical neurons, influences interneuron migration, restores activity-dependent dendritic retraction in transplanted cortical organoids.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have engineered chimeric cytokine receptors that are expressed in therapeutic cells to enhance their activity and therapeutic potential. To prevent toxicity from hyperactivity, the activation state of these receptors can be regulated by a drug that acts on proteases. While chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy effectively treats liquid cancers, further improvements in persistence and potency are needed to combat solid cancers clinically. Regulating cytokine-triggered intracellular signaling cascades related to growth and proliferation could help augment CAR-T cell activity, enhancing anti-tumor efficacy. To achieve this, Stanford researchers developed chimeric cytokine receptor (CCR) systems capable of constitutive signaling in the absence of their cognate cytokines. Their CCR system is comprised of two subunits, each including a heterologous dimerization domain and a cytokine receptor intracellular signaling domain (ICD). Because a cognate for the first dimerization domain is selected as the second dimerization domain and the two domains are in proximity, therapeutic cells with these CCRs have active intracellular signaling associated with persistence and potency downstream. The signaling cascade can be interrupted by regulating protease activity on ICDs to avoid exceeding the therapeutic window and causing toxicity. Cells with these CCRs could demonstrate sufficient anti-tumor activity to fight solid tumors. Applications include immunotherapy for cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and more, such as CAR-T therapy, TCR therapy, and CAR NK cell therapy. Advantages include a wide dynamic range of control, safety with no leaky activity in the off state, utilization of an FDA-approved small molecule to regulate cytokine signaling, compatibility with autologous, allogeneic or stem cell-derived therapeutic cells, inclusion of cysteine residues in the extracellular domain to stabilize the CCRs via disulfide bonds, and optional detection tags for cell surface expression.",

While single-cell genomics can identify cell types based on marker transcripts, there are no methods for isolating these populations for further downstream analysis.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have found that a vaccine, enhanced with adjuvants that imprint an antiviral state on innate immune cells and non-hematopoietic organ cells, could confer lasting nonspecific protection against diverse pathogens. Conventional vaccines are designed to produce antigen-specific antibodies or cytotoxic T cell responses against specific pathogens. However, some inadvertently invoke heterologous immunity against non-targeted antigens. This can be leveraged to design pathogen-agnostic universal vaccines. Recent studies suggest that both immunological memory in the adaptive immune system and trained immunity of innate immune system are involved. However, further investigation is needed to identify specific mechanisms to modulate to induce nonspecific immunity. Stanford researchers have found that the interaction between the adaptive and innate immune systems and non-hematopoietic cells in tissues is key to antigen-agnostic protective immunity. Based on their previous finding that BCG vaccine induces heterologous immunity via CD4 T-cell derived IFN-gamma, which imprints an antiviral state on the innate immune system and epithelial cells, they developed a vaccine containing antigen ovalbumin and GLA/3M-052 adjuvants, which elicit IFN-gamma responses. In vaccinated mice, antigen-stimulated T cells imprinted prolonged and broad innate-mediated antiviral resistance in myeloid and epithelial cells, protecting mice against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses, unrelated to the administered antigen. Applications: Stop-gap measure to prevent infection upon emergence of a new pathogen, Vaccines against prototype pathogens, Prophylactic treatment when anticipating increased exposure to pathogens.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have developed a working model that chemotherapy drugs induce peripheral neuropathy by activating a pathway that favors neuronal degeneration and impairs sensory neuron function. Combining modulation of factors downstream of this degenerative pathway with chemotherapy represents a promising strategy to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy without compromising tumor growth inhibition.\n\n40%-60% of patients treated with anticancer drugs develop chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN symptoms, such as tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, difficulty walking, and other challenges with daily activities, significantly deteriorate the quality of life and commonly develop into persistent, chronic neuropathic pain. As a result, the healthcare costs associated with CIPN are substantial, with treatment expenses for patients suffering from CIPN exceeding those for patients without the condition by $15,000 (in 2006 dollars). With the number of cancer survivors projected to top 20 million by 2030, preventing CIPN is both a pressing and a growing healthcare challenge.\n\nActivating the neuronal degenerative pathway through overexpression and treatment with a chemotherapy drug in C. elegans impairs touch sensation which recapitulates symptoms if CIPN seen in patients. Importantly, in mice, knockout animals that genetically lack the downstream factors are less sensitive to chemotherapy than their wild-type littermates suggesting inhibition of this pathway may be preventative of CPIN. Importantly, targeting downstream factors makes it unlikely that tumor growth inhibition will be compromised during chemotherapy.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Clinician-scientists at Stanford have proposed a WNT formulation that, when used in combination with a first-of-its-kind normothermic perfusion device, reconditions marginal organs and enables their safe transplantation. Each year, >100,000 people wait for organ transplant yet only 40,000 transplants are performed, leaving a waiting list of 60,000 patients with end-stage organ disease and no available options. A significant number of marginal organs are recovered but are not transplanted due to concerns of poor quality, suboptimal function, and limited regenerative capacity. What is critically needed to address this organ shortage are methods that allow for marginal organ rehabilitation, thus enabling them to be successfully transplanted without compromising patient outcomes. There are two features of the proposed technology. The first is a perfusion device that mimics heart function, an oxygenator that mimics lung function, and a dialysis system that mimics kidney function. The second feature is the use of a novel perfusate additive, liposome-packaged human WNT protein (L-WNT). WNTs are potent stem cell activators that activate endogenous stem cells and enhance cell viability, thereby improving engraftment efficiency. The unique perfusion device loosens the narrow time constraints for transplantation, thereby allowing in-depth organ evaluation and clinical intervention. The use of L-WNT raises the possibility of functional liver reconditioning. Such a regenerative intervention has the potential to dramatically reduce organ shortages and in doing so, transform the organ transplantation landscape. Applications: Enable organ procurement organizations (responsible for donor management, organ retrieval, organ preservation, and organ transportation) to retrieve marginal organs and optimize them ex vivo prior to dispersal. Enhance hospital systems with organ transplant programs that are responsible for organ preservation, optimization, and transplantation into intended recipients. Support hospitals with major oncologic and hepatobiliary programs that offer major resections or ablations of partial liver for benign and oncologic conditions. Advantages: The technology ameliorates ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI), thus reducing postoperative complications and their associated costs. The normothermic perfusion device with dialysis capabilities allows for sustained holding times, while the L-WNT perfusate additive enhances tissue repair and regeneration through its action on endogenous stem cells.",

The uSMAART (ultra-Sensitive Measurement of Aggregated Activity in Restricted cell-Types) technology enables the study of small dynamic variation of one or more biological process in the healthy and pathological brain from animal undergoing ecologically relevant behavior. Fiber photometry, a measurement technique that aggregates fluorescence signal using a fiber optic, is a highly pervasive approach in the field of systems neuroscience to study in vivo brain tissue dynamics during ecologically relevant behavior. Despite its common usage by researchers and companies alike, none of the state-of-the art fiber photometry device is capable of detecting small and fast signal changes in a low-light regime in freely behaving animals. Current technologies are benchmarked against cytosolic calcium indicators whose dynamic ranges far exceed that of the instrument and biological noises. Therefore, when used outside of this original configuration, i.e. with other fluorescent indicators (voltage, neuromodulator sensors\u2026) with much weaker dynamic ranges, these instruments do not protect against unwanted noise sources which can lead to biological confounds, especially when the instrumental noise correlates with the animal motion.

    "ip_description": "Inventors at Stanford have developed a novel strategy to perform concurrent fluorescence measurements of multiple biological parameters in freely moving and head-restrained animals. As more genetically encoded fluorescent indicators (GEFI) are being developed to monitor, in living animals, a wide range of biological phenomenon (e.g. transmembrane voltage, ions, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, opioids, pH\u2026), optical approaches that capture the precise temporal relationship of many physiological processes simultaneously in awake animals become critically necessary. Unlike our invention, none of the existing technologies offers the experimental flexibility to combine multiple fluorescence sensors and monitor those signals.\n\nTwo of the most common optical tools in neuroscience to study in vivo brain tissue dynamics during ecologically relevant behavior are fiber photometry and mesoscopic imaging. Fiber photometry is a measurement technique that aggregates fluorescence signal using a fiber optic. While it captures signal at the tip of the fiber, mesoscope imaging will instead capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of the fluorescence signal in awake, head-fixed animals. Recent studies have used both techniques to optically sense voltage, calcium, or neuromodulator dynamics in a variety mouse behavior.\n\nHowever, none of the state-of-the art fiber photometry devices or 1-photon epifluorescence mesoscope systems are capable of imaging more than 1 biological parameter at once while precisely referencing biological noises. Indeed, until now, there has not been a suitable method to account for various biological artifacts while imaging 2 spectrally orthogonal fluorescent proteins that capture two independent biological parameters. Therefore, while multiplexing fluorescent signals gain more appeal in the field, molecular strategy and technological implementations to achieve this with high sensitivity and low cost is needed.\n\nHere, we introduce a new molecular strategy and offer two technological implementations for fiber photometry and mesoscope imaging. While the former relies on a lock-in amplification technique, the latter relies on precise control over the illumination activation and imaging frame acquisition. Our simple molecular solution can be used with any fiber photometry systems (used in freely behaving animals) or 1-photon epifluorescence wide-field imaging techniques (used in head-fixed animals) to probe the dynamics of multiple molecular phenomena concurrently in awake animals. This strategy is universally applicable to any fluorescent reporters, from genetically encoded fluorescent proteins to synthetic dyes and nanoparticles. This strategy will reduce by 50% the cost of instrumentations used for fluorescence multiplexing of dynamic processes.\n\nStage of Development: Research \u2013 in vivo \u2013 working prototype and proof-of-concept in mice\n\nApplications:\n- Neuroscience research\n- Medical Diagnostics and Treatment Monitoring\n- Pharmaceutical Development, Drug discovery platform\n- Analytic chemistry\n\nAdvantages:\n- A cost-effective method to multiplex fluorescence signals.\n- Simultaneous dual biological parameters with identical performance, in freely and head-restrained behaving mouse.\n- Safeguarding against instrumental and/or biological artefacts.\n- Universally applicable to any fluorescent reporters, from genetically encoded fluorescent proteins to synthetic dyes and nanoparticles.",

T1D is an autoimmune disease in which insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed by the patient's own immune system. The resulting insulin deficiency is most often managed through exogenous insulin administration. This requires frequent or constant blood glucose level monitoring and insulin administration, significantly diminishing the patient's quality of life. Many studies have suggested transplantation of macroencapsulated islet beta cells as a means to achieve insulin independence. The encapsulation can provide a robust barrier against the host immune system. However, it could also impede insulin diffusion from the encapsulation, making it difficult to release insulin at physiological levels. Stanford researchers have discovered that applying pressure to the macroencapsulation could enhance insulin transport kinetics. A modest pressure equivalent to normal diastolic blood pressure sufficiently improved insulin flux across encapsulating membranes. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that pressure-driven flow is superior to relying solely on diffusion. Transplantation of the pressurized macroencapsulation of beta islets could help T1D patients achieve full insulin independence.

Emphysema is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease characterized by irreversible damage to the lung's air sacs. Severe emphysema can be treated with lung volume reduction surgery, which involves resection of the affected areas. However, many patients are not candidates for this invasive procedure. An existing less invasive treatment option, bronchoscopic endobronchial valve placement, is often ineffective due to collateral ventilation through damaged airways. To develop an alternative, Stanford researchers have repurposed stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, commonly used to treat acute lung cancer. Irradiation can noninvasively induce scarring in the treated lung tissue, resulting in volume reduction. Through a phase I clinical trial in severe emphysema patients, optimal strategies for radiation dose distribution and patient selection were determined.

Genome editing technologies have revolutionized the field of personalized medicine. Despite its initial promise, many of these methods have failed to deliver useful clinical therapeutics. Two commonly used methods, AAV and nanoparticles, lack flexibility in their cellular specificity programming to be widely used in tissue or cell specific diseases. Engineered cells have emerged as promising delivery vehicles, but current engineering methods lack specific and programmable macromolecule delivery. Cells have evolved several methods of direct molecule exchange that have cell type specificity, including trogocytosis. Trogocytosis is favorable because it has been shown to be bidirectional, and it maintains the functional integrity of the transported molecules. However, engineered macromolecule delivery methods have yet to capitalize on this method of cell-to-cell transport. The inventors have created a novel cell engineering strategy (TRANSFER) for the delivery of macromolecules in a cell specific fashion. More specifically, the inventors have harnessed the power of trogocytosis to deliver macromolecules from an engineered cell to another cell in vivo, allowing for targeted delivery while maintaining the functional integrity of the macromolecules being transported. The macromolecules can subsequently be freed from endosomes in recipient cells and optionally functionalized in a trogocytosis-like pH-responsive membrane fusion. This method is fully programmable and allows for tissue and cell specific targeting as well as the delivery of many different macromolecules.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed for sequence-agnostic sequencing and has revolutionized every area of biomedical science. One application of NGS is assaying the nucleic acid binding or modifying for a single protein interacting with thousands to millions of sequences simultaneously. However, increasing the number of proteins assayed has been difficult, costly, and labor-intensive. In another vein, microfluidics platforms have allowed for the parallel assessment of binding affinities of a several sequences with hundreds of transcription factors (TFs). Microfluidic technology has not yet been leveraged to assay the binding of many TFs to many sequences in parallel. The inventors have developed a novel approach to assay many sequences and many proteins binding affinity at the same time. Specifically, they use a barcode and print approach that links particular members of pooled sequenced libraries to specific protein variants that interact with the particular library members. Briefly, a barcoded library of sequences and a library of proteins that are imprinted at discrete locations to provide a barcode of sorts for the protein variant are created and pooled. These libraries are then put through a microfluidic device separately such that each microfluidic droplet contains one protein variant and one sequence. These are then incubated with a capture agent that binds to variant proteins and the captured sequences bound to the variant proteins are sequenced. This allows for the assessment of many different protein-sequence binding partners in a single assay. Applications include high throughput assessment of many different protein-sequence interactions in the same assay.

Blocking the immune signal can be applied in various contexts, such as treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), diabetic nephropathy, and metabolic syndrome among other metabolic diseases. Obesity is a global issue and commonly associated with conditions such as liver dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The lack of effective therapeutics, coupled with a predicted 57% of the world population having an obesity-related condition by 2030, necessitates the development of novel treatment options. Blocking the immune receptor signal in a fatty liver disease mouse model led to a ~28% decrease in weight and complete removal of abdominal fat over 10 weeks in treated mice relative to control mice. Additionally, a verified biomarker in the form of a risk allele is available which can be used to quickly and reliably determine if patients are likely to benefit from the treatment. Consequently, blocking agents for the immune receptor have the potential to enhance and complement current treatment options for obesity, such as weight management and GLP-1 agonists, and serve as a broadly useful treatment strategy for patients suffering from obesity-related conditions. Applications: Treatment of obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and hyperglycemia; Treatment of chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the liver and other organs; Combined treatment with current available options such as weight management and GLP-1 agonists.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common leukemia in adults, with over 20,000 new cases a year in the US and a five-year overall survival rate of only 27%. While reliable methods for predicting patient outcomes in AML could aid clinical decision making by e.g. predicting which patients would benefit from more aggressive treatment, AML risk is currently evaluated by a complex combination of factors including age, patient performance status, cytogenetics, and medical history. This method is unreliable particularly for the 30% of patients that lack genetic abnormalities associated with clinical outcomes. To address this, Stanford researchers discovered transcriptional programs in AML that are associated with either improved or worse patient outcomes. Researchers treated AML patient cells with human immune cells, identifying subsets of AML cells that are either sensitive or resistant to immune cell killing. Immune-resistant AML cells were found to express RNA transcripts associated with poor survival rates in a large database of AML patient transcriptomes. Better and poorer patient outcomes could be predicted from the expression of RNAs associated with sensitivity and resistance to immune cell killing. Stage of Development: Proof of concept: AML patient cells that are resistant to immune cell killing in vitro express transcripts associated with poorer patient outcomes, while patient cells that are sensitive to immune cell killing express transcripts associated with improved outcomes.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed an innovative approach for accurate and automated cell classification on H&E-stained images using multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) imaging, eliminating human annotations, and enhancing biological interpretability in histopathology. Accurate and reliable cell classification using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is crucial for disease diagnosis, yet challenges persist using current methods which rely on error-prone and time-consuming manual annotations. Moreover, existing AI approaches lack interpretability and struggle with spatial resolution limitations, hindering precise analysis of cell types. Hence, prior efforts at automation have been hampered by inefficient manual annotation processes, limiting analysis to few cell types, and yielding suboptimal results. To address these challenges, Stanford researchers have developed an innovative method using mIF imaging to accurately classify cells in H&E-stained images, providing a robust ground truth based on protein markers. This approach enables the identification of diverse cell types with higher accuracy and generates extensive data for training deep learning models. By training on this ground truth, deep learning models outperform existing methods, facilitating precise cell type identification for personalized treatment decisions in precision medicine. In summary, this automated cell classification approach not only eliminates manual annotations but also ensures reliable, accurate and biologically interpretable results, marking a significant advancement in histopathology.

Persister cells are dormant, making them less susceptible to many antibiotics, which are designed to kill growing cells. Administration of nanoparticles in combination with one or more antibiotics was found to be highly efficacious in eradicating persister cells and effective against both planktonic bacteria as well as biofilms for a broad range of bacterial species, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Immunotherapy is a cancer treatment approach that modulates the patient's immune system to target and eliminate tumor cells. While it has greatly improved the outlook for patients with liquid tumor cancer, its effectiveness against solid tumors, which account for most cancers, has been relatively low. This is because solid tumor cells release chemokines to their microenvironment to attract certain cells that exert immunosuppressive effects. Accumulation of these cells leads to immunosuppression, tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis \u2013 all of which could interfere with cancer treatment. Therefore, removing these cells from the microenvironment could help improve patient prognosis. The Stanford researchers discovered an antagonist that acts on chemokine receptor found on these immunosuppressing cells and showed that such antagonist can delay tumor progression by interfering with recruitment of these immunosuppressing cells. Administration of the antagonist could be a promising treatment option for cancer patients, especially those with immunotherapy-resistant solid tumor, either as a stand-alone therapy or in conjunction with other neoadjuvant therapies. It has shown synergistic effects when combined with immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Inherently, the telomeres located at the ends of chromosomes shorten during each cycle of DNA replication and cell division, eventually topping DNA replication and leading to cell senescence and death. Cancer cells have unlimited replication potential and evade cell senescence by preventing telomere shortening. They depend on aberrant expression of the enzyme telomerase for their ability to continue to propagate in their victims. Consequently, development of anti-cancer therapies that target telomerase has been attempted. However, success of such therapies has been limited, and this has been attributed to the slowness of attrition of nucleotide repeat sequences of telomeric DNA, and importantly, to the ability of cancer cells to develop alternative (ALT) methods of telomere elongation. The technology being marketed teaches a novel approach to telomere shortening that is accomplished by preventing RNA transcript elongation on telomeric DNA templates.\n\nStanford researchers have identified SUPT4H1, a component of DSIF complex as a target for preventing growth of ALT-dependent cancer cells. Inhibiting SUPT4H1's action affects transcription of TERRA, a non-coding RNA synthesized using telomeric DNA as template. Inhibiting SUPT4H1's actions reduces the ability of the RNA polymerase to produce TERRA transcripts required by ALT, leading to telomere shortening (Figure 1) and consequently to cessation of cell division. The SUPT4H1 gene and its partner in formation of the DSIF complex can be inhibited using established gene silencing methods or chemical compounds. Some such compounds have been identified and have been shown to affect the actions of SUPT4H1 and SUPT5H in vitro and in vivo.\n\nApplications:\n- Treatment of cancers by interference with telomere elongation.\n\nAdvantages:\n- Affects ALT-dependent telomere elongation\n- Can be implemented using any of the established gene silencing techniques.\n- No existing competitive product",

It is challenging to therapeutically modulate gene expression only in specific cell types to treat disease. One solution would be to reprogram the gene regulatory sequences in the genome, which control gene expression in cell-type specific ways. Stanford researchers have developed a new technology, called Variant Flow-FISH, that efficiently edits the human genome as desired and is also able to measure the effects of the variants on gene expression. The technology involves three steps: pools of edits are introduced into the human genome using CRISPR prime editing, ii) cells are sorted via FACS into 6 bins based on gene expression levels using RNA FlowFISH, iii) DNA sequencing is performed to determine the frequency of edits across the 6 bins and determine the effect of the variants on gene expression. Stanford inventors have successfully applied the technology to identify specific synthetic sequences that can be introduced into a non-coding regulatory sequence at the PPIF locus, to change expression of the PPIF gene in monocytes, a gene linked to inflammatory bowel disease. Variant Flow-FISH was used to introduce hundreds of noncoding variants into cells in a single experiment and measure each of the variants' effects on the expression of the _PPIF_ gene. Applications: Characterizing disease variants in their endogenous genomic context, Identify gene sequence changes to tune gene expression, Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, Decrease PPIF gene expression in monocytes, Therapeutics for Coronary Artery Disease. Advantages: Avoids deriving single-cell clonal populations, Quantitative, Detects small effects on gene expression (5-10%), Fast: ~3-4 weeks for editing and reading out effects on the gene expression, Overcomes inherent inefficiencies/inaccuracies of CRISPR: inefficient editing or multiple indels, Variant Flow-FISH measures the effect of each allele through pooled sequencing and analysis of allele frequencies in a population of cells.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a high-affinity IL-11 decoy cytokine for super-agonism and antagonism of the IL-11 receptor, enabling the treatment of a wide variety of diseases from inflammatory disease to cancer as well as research into IL-11 signaling pathways. Interleukin-11 (IL-11) signaling plays a significant role in many diseases through its roles in inflammation, tissue repair, and cancer progression. For example, IL-11 blocking antibodies are in clinical development for pulmonary fibrosis while wild-type IL-11 is approved as a treatment for thrombocytopenia. However, stronger binders to the IL-11 receptor have the potential to be more effective treatments. Stanford researchers therefore developed an IL-11 decoy cytokine with much higher affinity for the IL-11 receptor than the wild-type cytokine. High-throughput combinatorial screening identified mutations to IL-11 that increased its binding affinity to the IL-11 receptor 70-fold. Researchers identified additional mutations that converted this super-agonist to an antagonist by ablating binding to the gp130 co-receptor. Finally, they identified other mutations that enabled high-affinity binding to the mouse IL-11 receptor (~10-fold over wildtype) without affecting human IL-11 receptor binding. This engineered cytokine slows the growth of tumors in a mouse model of non-small cell lung cancer. Applications include IL-11 antagonists for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory disease, and fibrotic disease; IL-11 agonists for the treatment of thrombocytopenia; and research in IL-11 signaling. Advantages include high specificity for the IL-11 receptor, high affinity binding to the human IL-11 receptor (~70-fold higher than endogenous IL-11), high affinity binding to the mouse IL-11 receptor (~10-fold higher than endogenous mouse IL-11) to enable research in mouse models, and small size allowing for diffusion into tumors (~19 kDa cytokine vs ~150 kDa antibodies).",

    "ip_description": "Pharmacologic agents are commonly used to treat psychiatric diseases. These compounds, however, react differently across patients, are often followed by negative side effects and can have varied efficacy timeframes. Unfortunately, determining the efficacy and side-effect profile for therapeutics can be a time-consuming and costly process. To circumvent this issue, inventors at Stanford have designed a solution to analyze patient-specific drug responses by integrating organoids within a microfluidic chip for tissue culture and high-throughput screening. Microfluidics allows precision control of fluid flow to determine parameters like nutrient delivery, mechanical stimulus, and drug delivery at the microscale level, all by using a thousand-fold smaller volume of materials compared to standard plate assays. Using the chip, users can measure how drugs of interest would act in the patient's body by using a small skin sample. As a proof of concept, the inventors utilized the platform to model antidepressant effects on the gut-brain axis. The system seeds gut organoids with patient-representative gut microbiota onto a microfluidic chip, through which the drugs can be run through. Then, the inventors measured serotonin concentration as an output indicative of gut serotonin production over the course of treatment with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). The output provided a snapshot into how different SSRIs affect the gut microbiome and gut serotonin production on a patient-specific basis, while laying the foundation for understanding variability in treatment response. Overall, the platform enables a high accuracy, high throughput, patient-centered approach for screening drug responses that increases the potential for positive therapeutic outcomes.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a pioneering gene therapy by targeting reactive astrocytes in the optic nerve head (ONH) and modulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels for targeted treatment of glaucoma and other retinal disorders. Despite the increasing prevalence of retinal disorders like glaucoma in the US, effective targeted therapies for afflicted patients are scarce. Current treatments, such as eye drops, merely aim to slow disease progression without addressing the root cause. Despite the pivotal role of ONH astrocytes driving the pathogenesis of glaucoma and various optic neuropathies, there is a lack of therapeutic methods targeting this cell population in retinal disorders. Addressing this gap is crucial for developing effective targeted treatments for irreversible conditions like glaucoma and other retinal disorders. Stanford researchers have filled this critical gap by pioneering a gene therapy solution targeting reactive astrocytes in the optic nerve for the treatment of glaucoma and other inner retinal disorders. These astrocytes, when injured, differentiate into either protective or harmful reactive astrocytes, which are controlled by cAMP. This invention specifically modulates the cAMP levels, either by increasing nuclear or depleting cytosolic cAMP, promoting the proliferation of protective astrocytes, and inhibiting harmful ones, ultimately aiding in retinal ganglion cell survival after optic nerve injury in glaucoma. By targeting specific reactive astrocyte populations and modulating compartmented cAMP, this invention marks a significant advancement in targeted gene therapy and holds promise for treating glaucoma and other inner retinal disorders. Stage of Development: Pre-clinical. Next steps involve continued testing in preclinical models of glaucoma, followed by large animal proof-of-concept and toxicology studies.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have developed a novel hydrogel for long-term drug delivery of an Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) inhibitor for the prevention of post-surgical abdominal adhesion. Abdominal adhesions are fibrotic scars that form between abdominal organs and occur in 50-90% of abdominal operations. Their work shows that the formulation prevents adhesion and does not hinder healing at the site of surgery. There are currently no effective standard-of-care anti-adhesion treatments for abdominal adhesion, therefore, this has the potential to immensely improve clinical care.\n\nAdhesions occur post-operatively in 50- 90% of all open abdominal operations, representing an enormous clinical problem impacting hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. Currently, there is no standard-of-care treatment to prevent adhesions which can cause bowel obstruction, chronic pain, and/or infertility. T-5224 is a small molecule inhibitor of the Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex, and local application of the drug has previously been shown to prevent abdominal adhesion. But, a practical and effective delivery method of the drug has not been developed for clinical use.\n\nUsing a mouse and porcine model of abdominal adhesions, the researchers found the hydrogel formulation promotes sustained release of T-5224 and inhibits adhesion formation in vivo. Importantly, no negative side effects were observed. Consequently, sustained release of AP-1 inhibitors to the surgical site has the potential to drastically improve post-surgical outcomes by eliminating abdominal adhesion in patients.\n\n**Stage of Development:**\n\n*   Preclinical\n*   Continued research \u2013 Validation in a porcine model, application for ongoing grant support\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Prevention of abdominal adhesions in patients following surgical operations or intra-abdominal infection\n*   Treatment of other peritoneal diseases related to fibrosis (e.g., peritoneal carcinomatosis)\n*   Fibrosis elsewhere in the body (e.g., prevention of pleural or pericardial fibrosis in the context of surgical procedures in the chest or prevention of adhesions after tendon repairs)\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   These findings represent a topical formulation for an effective anti-adhesion treatment\n*   No effective standard-of-care anti-adhesion therapies exist\n*   Potential significant advancement in the prevention of abdominal adhesions",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a new, low-cost method for tumor methylation profiling that enables tumor classification even from low amounts of fragmented DNA characteristic of liquid biopsies. Methylation profiling has emerged as a critical tool in the diagnosis and classification of cancer. The abnormal patterns of gene methylation found in cancer cells can enable early diagnosis, cancer type classification, prognosis assessment, and treatment monitoring. However, available methods for classifying methylation status are lacking. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing is prohibitively costly, while methylation arrays are limited by a requirement for high amounts of input DNA and poor overlap with cell-type markers critical for tumor classification. Other methods are also not suited for the fragmented DNA and low tumor cellularity found in many biopsies. Stanford researchers therefore developed a new method for methylation classification (\"XR-methylseq\") that is low cost, unbiased, enables tumor type classification, and suitable for low, fragmented DNA inputs (down to 250 pg). DNA fragments are ligated to an adapter, digested with a restriction enzyme at CCGG motifs, and ligated to a second adapter. Fragments are enzymatically converted to distinguish methylation status and only fragments with both adapters are amplified and sequenced. Researchers demonstrated that this technique can accurately classify CNS tumors from CSF, which is not possible using other methods due to the low DNA content and tumor cellularity found in CSF. Applications: Analysis of both solid and liquid biopsies (e.g., urine, CSF, biopsy supernatant), Diagnosis and classification of cancer, Early cancer detection, Prediction of cancer prognosis, Personalized cancer treatment, Minimal residual disease testing, Monitoring of treatment response and resistance, Basic research into methylation profiles. Advantages: Overlaps with cell type markers to enable tumor classification, Uses enzymatic digestion instead of harsh bisulfite chemistries that break DNA, Works with low DNA inputs (250 pg) and low tumor cellularity, Low cost, Works with fragmented DNA often seen in biopsies, Highly correlated with WGBS gold standard (not biased), 95%+ on-target rate, leading to an 18-fold enrichment at CCGG flanks.",

Hundreds of millions of patients worldwide develop new scars every year, and scars and their associated problems cost the United States over $20 billion every year.

Further, while typical scarred skin lacks hair follicles and sweat glands, Verteporfin allowed the regrowth of these very important skin elements.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed improved methods for producing mRNAs. Efficient, robust and high fidelity production of mRNAs is critical for obtaining pharmaceutical quality vaccines, viruses and expression constructs, and for eliminating noise due to batch variation. The researchers optimized conditions for efficient mRNA synthesis, m7G-capping, and poly(A)-tailing of in vitro transcribed RNA. Such mRNA synthesis can be performed for an individual mRNA but was optimized to be equally well performed for hundreds of different barcoded mRNAs in parallel in one reaction. They also developed a powerful new platform that uses barcoded synthetic mRNA libraries to measure translation efficiency (via polysome profiling) and stability (via time course RNA sequencing). Such synthetic mRNAs carry a unique nucleotide barcode in the 3' UTR that can be used for mRNA identification in large-scale parallel assays based on RNA-seq. This platform allows high-throughput testing of tens of thousands of rationally and/or computationally designed sequences to achieve optimal protein levels. The nucleotide sequence of mRNA is a primary determinant of efficient cellular gene expression; thus, the ability to perform a large-scale analysis of designed mRNA sequences for their ability to be translated efficiently and remain stable inside cells is essential to developing candidates. The new, massively parallel, powerful reporter assay platform is poised to evaluate existing and novel sequence designs as well as inform future rational designs of mRNA-based therapeutics in broader contexts.

Despite a plethora of clinical options and an enormous consumer market for scar treatment; no current therapeutic strategy prevents or reverses this fibrotic process. Inventors at Stanford developed a novel method of use of Piezo1 and Piezo2 inhibitors in the prevention of skin scarring. Piezo channels are mechanosensitive ion channels that mediate stretch sensation. Piezo1 and Piezo2 inhibitors inhibit cellular mechanical signaling, an important contributor to scarring and fibrosis. Using a mouse model of wound healing, we find that a single dose of piezo1 or piezo2 treatment (local injection) reduces scarring and fibrosis, specifically via adipocytes as they are mechanically sensitive. Aside from physically offloading wound tension through specialized wound dressings, no effective therapy for skin scarring exists. No targeted molecular agents have been able to reduce scar burden while not comprising or delaying wound repair. The novel method not only reduces scarring, but also improves scar appearance and allows for regrowth of skin elements such as hair follicles and sweat glands (absent in scars), which are highly significant outcomes for patients suffering from skin scarring.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Scar prevention in the skin\n*   Inhibition of mechanical sensing in adipocytes\n*   Treatment of organ fibrosis\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   Currently, there is no effective drug that can overcome skin fibrosis in the skin.

No disease-modifying drugs exist, making major joint replacement surgery the only viable long-term solution. A critical hindrance to developing disease-modifying drugs for osteoarthritis is its usual late detection in patients, making it challenging to reverse disease pathogenesis. Immune cell involvement in OA pathogenesis has been identified, but the specific cell types involved, their spatiotemporal dynamics in disease, and cellular crosstalk that results in joint degeneration have not been extensively studied. Studying the peripheral blood of patients is a low-cost, accessible way to gain insight into the OA immune landscape.

This work is based on the identification of blood metabolites in pregnant women that can accurately predict gestational age and provide insights into pregnancy variations undetected by ultrasound (currently the most accurate timing method for pregnancy). In the new method, a computational model, trained using temporally aligned analyte measurements derived from a cohort of pregnant individuals, is used to assess metabolite data sampled from a pregnant subject over one or more time points. This approach aligns temporal data to evaluate gestational age, time to labor, preterm birth, and preterm abortion including diagnostics to be utilized for clinical interventions. Accurate estimation of the timing of pregnancy and birth is important for many clinical decisions in obstetrics, including determination of preterm birth and related treatment regimens. However, current clinical methods are based on information about the last menstruation date, which can be imprecise, or ultrasound imaging, which depends on accessibility at early pregnancy. Moreover, the accuracy of ultrasound for estimating gestational age is suboptimal, with only 40% of the newborns delivered within 7 days of the predicted due dates.\n\nA recent study by the researchers demonstrated that the development of clinical tools with a few metabolites in maternal blood to time pregnancy is promising.

    "ip_description": "A team of Stanford researchers has identified a group of small molecules that can prevent or reverse T cell exhaustion, thereby increasing the effectiveness of adoptive T cell therapies to fight cancer or chronic infections. Immunotherapy using CAR-T cells relies on T cell receptor (TCR) signaling to activate the cells that will mediate potent antitumor or anti-infective effects. However, over time, chronic signaling through the endogenous TCR or CAR can induce a dysfunctional state called 'T cell exhaustion', reducing the overall effectiveness of therapy. Moreover, CARs are prone to antigen independent signaling in vitro and in vivo, further underscoring the need to modulate CAR signaling to preserve CAR T function. The inventors utilized small molecules to inhibit protein kinases and address this overstimulation problem. Since proximal kinases are necessary to transmit TCR and CAR signaling, modulating their effects in a rational manner can enhance CAR-T cell function. This approach could be used in vivo or ex vivo to expand genetically engineered T cells that are less exhausted and therefore more potent. This reversible 'CAR-T switch' system transiently inhibits TCR or CAR signaling to prevent or reverse T cell exhaustion and restore T cell function, with applications in basic research or immunotherapy for infectious disease or cancer.\n\nThe inventors initially used a known, FDA-approved drug to demonstrate the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on reversing T cell exhaustion and augmenting T cell function in vivo. Further studies and collaborations with additional Stanford researchers have demonstrated similar effects using different, novel compounds.\n\nCAR-T cells expanded ex vivo in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors maintained a memory-like phenotype, which is associated with improved clinical responses in patients.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a next-generation protein sequencing platform capable of identifying all the proteins in a cell at single amino acid resolution. Methods for single-cell RNA and DNA sequencing have revolutionized science and medicine. However, genetic data poorly reports on the proteins in a cell, as post-transcriptional modifications critical to cellular function (e.g., protein phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination) are not encoded in mRNA, and mRNA levels are often poorly predictive of protein levels. Despite this, robust methods for identifying and quantifying the proteins in a cell are lacking. Current mass spectrometry approaches can only identify a small fraction of all the proteins in a cell, while emerging approaches such as nanopore and real-time dynamic protein sequencing suffer from poor generalizability, throughput, and sensitivity. Researchers therefore developed a new protein sequencing method that combines the well-established technologies of Edman degradation and high-throughput DNA sequencing. Briefly, one amino acid at a time is removed from the end of each protein and barcoded with DNA that are specific to the protein molecule. The DNA barcoded amino acid derivatives are recognized by an antibody specific for that amino acid. Importantly, such antibodies can also recognize specific post-translational modifications. DNA barcodes associated with each antibody encode the identity of the amino acid, the protein it came from, and its location in the protein. DNA sequencing of these barcodes then reveals the amino acid sequence of each protein. Critically, signal amplification during DNA sequencing allows for high sensitivity. Stage of Development: Proof of concept: development of Edman degradation conditions compatible with DNA and DNA-barcoded antibodies specific for certain amino acids (including post-transcriptionally modified amino acids). Applications: Single-cell de novo protein sequencing at single-molecule resolution, High throughput database-assisted single-cell protein identification, Basic proteomics research, Diagnostics (e.g., detection of aberrant proteins such as beta-amyloid variants in Alzheimer's disease), Target discovery, Drug development (e.g., targeted protein degradation, de-ubiquitination, phosphorylation, etc). Advantages: Combines the well-established methods of Edman degradation and high throughput sequencing, Potential to sequence all the proteins in a single cell at single molecule resolution, High sensitivity, High throughput, Can identify any arbitrary protein sequence, Can detect post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, glycosylation, methylation, acetylation, etc.).",

More than 65 million individuals worldwide are estimated to have Long COVID (LC), where patients often report fatigue and other symptoms resembling myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Currently, there are no treatments or reliable diagnostic markers for fatigue. To address this gap in knowledge, Stanford researchers analyzed blood samples from individuals with fatigue syndromes, including LC, ME-CFS, and lupus patients, to successfully identify a common molecular signature of elevated oxidative stress in cells. Diagnostic analysis for fatigue can then be performed with one or more of flow cytometry, RNA-seq analysis, mass spectrometry, and systems chemistry analysis. Furthermore, the developed assays can identify specific drugs that can redress or lower oxidative stress in cells. Using this platform, Stanford researchers have successfully identified several FDA-approved drugs that can lower oxidative stress in cells.

To better enable cancer diagnosis, classification, staging, and early detection, Stanford researchers therefore developed a highly sensitive and specific method for analyzing cell-free cancer RNA. Researchers extensively optimized methods for blood collection, plasma separation, cell-free RNA purification, and library preparation. They designed a custom panel of 5,546 genes to identify and classify cancer with high sensitivity.

POCD affects patients of all ages but is more common in older people. A recent study reported that 28.5% of people over 60 develop POCD upon discharge. Predicting the risk of developing POCD would improve interventions and patient care. Therefore, Stanford researchers developed a method that assesses patient risk for POCD after surgery that involves: 1.

    "ip_description": "Stanford BIODESIGN researchers have developed a disease breathalyzer for detecting necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns. Newborn babies face a high risk of blood infections (sepsis) and gastrointestinal inflammation and injury disease (necrotizing enterocolitis 'NEC'). NEC affects 1 of 1000 premature infants with mortality rates up to 50%. Currently there is no early detection method available. The BIODESGIN NEC breath analyzer will facilitate treatment and save up to ten thousand or more lives each year through early detection. The device may be adapted to detect sepsis, a deadly late-stage infection.\n\nThe device consists of four key components - breath collection, gas analysis , data processing algorithm, and a data readout. (See Schematic.) Breath is collected via main stream (sensor embedded in tubing) or side stream (breath carried to sensors in an external box). Electrochemical sensors, infrared spectroscopy, etc. analyzes exhaled CO2, H2, CH4, and H2S gases. The algorithm relates the gas measurements and in future iterations will integrate additional medical data such as gestational age. Bedside patient monitoring will be available on the data readout screen.\n\n**Stage of Development \u2013 Proof of Concept**\nA clinical study is underway using a decentralized analysis instrument (in lab gas chromatography). The next stage of development will be bedside analysis. BIODESGIN researchers are running a prospective clinical study to confirm the biomarkers, after which they will develop a continuous monitoring prototype. The fully functional prototype will be used for a follow-on study including feasibility for sepsis detection. If feasible, clinical study use will expand to monitoring of inpatient pediatric and adult patients.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Bedside **neonatal ICU patient necrotizing enterocolitis disease detection and monitoring**.\n*   Potentially, inpatient pediatric and adult **sepsis detection**.\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   **Life-saving, first in class, early detection** of necrotizing enterocolitis - there are currently no detection methods or identified biomarkers for NEC.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have discovered that nanobodies blocking amphiregulin (AREG) activity have the potential to impede the progression of early-stage atherosclerotic plaque lesions to advanced-stage fibroatheromas. Coronary artery disease is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the build-up of atherosclerotic plaques. In the early stages, the plaques are rich in lipids and can be treated with medication and lifestyle changes. However, as they mature beyond the lipid-rich phase, a subset of activated T-cells within the plaques expresses the pro-fibrotic protein AREG. This protein promotes smooth muscle cell proliferation and fibrosis, leading to advancement of lesions into irreversible advanced-stage plaques, such as fibroatheroma. Fibroatheroma is a major precursor to plaque rupture that could lead to life-threatening acute cardiac syndromes. To prevent the development of fibroatheromas, Stanford researchers have devised a nanobody-based platform that blocks the attachment of AREG to atherosclerotic plaque lesions, hindering disease progression. The nanobody is a bispecific protein with two immunoglobulin single variable (ISV) domains: one ISV domain binds to AREG and the other domain interferes with vascular smooth muscle cells activity. This nanobody-based platform targeting the root cause of fibroatheroma development could revolutionize treatment strategies for patients with coronary artery disease.",

Base editors can introduce single base pair mutations directly into genomes, but in addition, can also introduce a variety of different genetic variants. The newly developed single-cell technology can i) genome engineer mutations, ii) directly identify their presence among individual cells and iii) determine each mutation's transcriptional phenotype. The multiplexed approach involves CRISPR base-editors to introduce the desired mutation into a target gene and long-read sequencing of the target gene's transcript to identify the engineered mutations. Simultaneously, the transcriptome profile can be assessed. The method allows for determination of the mutations' genotype and expression phenotype at single cell resolution via integration of the long and short read data. Additionally, the technology is not restricted to CRISPR based genome engineering since it is possible to directly genotype each single-cell independent of guide RNA. The TISCC-Seq can be applied to functionally evaluate numerous cancer mutations as one example.

One of them is toxicity, primarily cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity, but also on-target off-tumor toxicity. Another barrier is the lack of CAR T cell persistence, and more efficacious CAR-T cell therapies are needed especially those targeting solid tumors. The Mackall Lab at Stanford invented a novel way to harness the macrophage \u2013 CAR T cell interaction with the goal to address those two limitations: 1) Create a safety switch to quickly deplete CAR T cells in cases of toxicity, and 2) manipulate CAR T cells to enhance their persistence, improving their anti-tumor activity. The safety switch works by blocking \"don't eat me\" signals on the surface of CAR-T cells, resulting in efficient and fast elimination of CAR T cells by macrophages. Having an off-the-shelf antibody which can effectively deplete CAR T cells when they cause toxicity can be a valuable tool for immunotherapy. To obtain the opposite outcome and increase expansion and persistence exploiting the same CAR-T cell/macrophage regulatory axis, we over-express \"don't eat me\" signals on CAR T cells. This manipulation has no deleterious effect on their cytotoxic activity, but yields CAR-T cells more resistant to elimination by macrophages, leading to superior activity in models of solid and liquid tumors.

This information allows critical insight into the potential development of individualized immunotherapies for DLBCL and several other types of solid tumor. The potential therapeutic discoveries, clinical management improvements, and diagnostic impact of this invention can help guide personalized cancer medicine in a monumental way. Inventors analyzed patient biopsy samples from 1,300 DLBCL tumors and defined an atlas of 49 distinct transcriptional states across 13 major cell types. 94% of these states were validated from approximately 200,000 single cell transcriptomes derived from lymphomas, healthy control tonsil tissues and other tissue types. In later studies, inventors further analyzed 16 types of human carcinoma and defined an atlas of 69 cell states for these carcinomas. Applications: Personalized therapeutic target \u2013 For example, several immunologically-active lymphoma therapies rely on the dynamic of TME, such as rituximab, lenalidomide, CART 19, ibrutinib; Patient selection \u2013 for clinical studies; Cancer monitoring and follow-up.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a method that allows X-ray and CT imaging to achieve the same signal with two to three orders of magnitude less X-ray dosage. X-ray is a broadly used imaging modality with a large market of users for many healthcare applications. Its primary disadvantage is that this ionizing radiation can be harmful to the patients and healthcare providers that are exposed. Unfortunately, to have a high enough sensitivity to observe subtle absorption/transmission differences in the sample requires enough high X-ray photon doses which in many cases is enough radiation to be damaging. The method invented here lowers the amount of radiation required by using Compton scattering through a thin carbon target with a pulsed X-ray source to produce an X-ray and an electron which are measured in coincidence. Because the electron and photon are entangled, the detection of the electron means the X-ray photon exists. This quantum concept changes the statistics of the detection allowing a reduction of the number photons required to detect the same absorption/transmission difference from 10,000 photon/pixel to 100 photons/pixel for a 1% difference (2-3 orders of magnitude improvement). Applications: Diagnostic imaging by X-ray and CT. Advantages: Reduces X-ray dose 2-3 orders of magnitude for medical image, Improves imaging sensitivity for a given dose.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "A Stanford research team has patented methods that can prevent or reverse T cell exhaustion, thereby increasing the effectiveness of adoptive T cell therapies to fight cancer or chronic infections. These include engineering regulatable chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) as well as identifying a group of small molecules that can modulate or inhibit TCR signaling. Immunotherapy using CAR-T cells relies on endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) signaling which is responsible for optimal T cell activation and potent antitumor or anti-infective effects. However, continuous activation of CAR T cells can result in a dysfunctional state called \"T cell exhaustion\", reducing the overall effectiveness of therapy. To address this overstimulation problem, the inventors genetically engineered a regulatable CAR by attaching a protein domain that allows for control over CAR surface expression via addition of an FDA-approved small molecule drug. This system is designed such that CAR T cells can undergo temporary periods of rest during which the CAR T cell ceases to signal, thus mitigating T cell exhaustion and restoring therapeutic efficacy. In addition, the inventors showed that certain small molecules that inhibit protein kinases can also address the overstimulation problem through transient inhibition of TCR signaling. Both inventions have applications in basic research or immunotherapy for infectious disease or cancer.\n\nThe inventors have established an animal model of regulating CAR surface expression and demonstrated proof-of-concept for the engineered regulatable CAR system _in vitro_ and _in vivo_:\n\n*   _In vitro_ - Transient rest (i.e., removing the engineered chimeric antigen receptors from the cell surface for 72-96 hours) can reinvigorate T cells following exhaustion. This substantially enhances their function.\n*   _In vivo_ \u2013 Engineered chimeric antigen receptor and activity can be regulated. Culturing CAR T cells in the absence of the small molecule drug in order to \"hide\" surface CAR mitigates CAR tonic signaling/exhaustion and improves in vivo efficacy.\n\nThe inventors also used a known, FDA-approved drug to demonstrate the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on reversing T cell exhaustion and augmenting T cell function in vivo. Further studies and collaborations with additional Stanford researchers have demonstrated similar or stronger effects using different, novel compounds:\n\n*   _Ex vivo_ - CAR-T cells expanded ex vivo in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and infused into mice: a) had profoundly augmented proliferative capacity in vivo and b) could cure mice engrafted with osteosarcoma.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   **Immunotherapy** - prevent or reverse T cell exhaustion in cell therapy for cancer or chronic infection, including:\n    *   _Ex vivo_ expansion for adoptive transfer\n    *   _In vivo_ modulation of T cell receptor signaling\n*   **Research** - engineered T cell receptors and methods using protein kinase inhibitors could be used to study basic T cell function, signaling and exhaustion reversibility\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   **Enhanced CAR-T immunotherapy:**\n    *   preventing or reversing T cell exhaustion could improve effectiveness of immunotherapy for cancer or chronic infections\n    *   could improve cytotoxicity, proliferative capacity, cytokine secretion and formation of memory T cells\n*   **Transient effects** - Controlled CAR expression (and thus CAR signaling) as well as compounds' inhibitory effect on TCR signaling both provide mechanisms for T cells to \"rest\" and then restore functionality\n*   **Direct modulation:** - addresses root cause of T cell exhaustion (i.e., persistent antigen exposure leading to continuous TCR signaling) instead of relying on accessory pathways (such as PD-1/PD-L1)",

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have discovered that bispecific antibodies can selectively bind cancer cells and block the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 'don't eat me signal' to efficiently clear tumors with negligible toxicity. Developing bispecific antibodies to target cancer cells for phagocytosis can be an innovative method to help eliminate tumors and treat various cancers, such as lymphoma and leukemia.\n\nThe interaction between CD47 and SIRP\u03b1 transmits a 'don't eat me signal' that inhibits phagocytosis as a mechanism for the immune system to identify self from non-self. Cancer cells commonly overexpress CD47 to take advantage of this signal and avoid elimination by phagocytosis. Efforts to block CD47 using recombinant variants of SIRP\u03b1 have been explored as a therapeutic approach to promote the elimination of tumor cells. However, CD47 expression on normal cells serves as an 'antigen sink,' which reduces the efficacy of CD47 blockade and potentially leads to toxicity due to their phagocytosis. Previous studies have shown that therapeutic antibodies that bind tumor antigens to induce phagocytosis are synergistic with CD47 blockage, suggesting that a bifunctional protein that performs these two functions can be a viable option for specifically and efficiently inducing phagocytosis of cancer cells.\n\nBispecific antibodies designed by the Stanford researchers have low affinity for CD47, rendering them unable to bind normal cells expressing CD47 alone, and high affinity for the tumor antigen CD20, demonstrating selective binding to CD20/CD47 dual antigen-expressing tumor cells. Importantly, the treatment using these bispecific antibodies in mice transplanted or transfused with cancer cells resulted in a significant extension of their survival and depleted target cells in non-human primates with no observed toxicity. Consequently, bispecific antibodies have the potential to improve cancer treatments by targeting tumor cells for phagocytic elimination in patients.\n\nApplications:\n- Development of bispecific antibodies to treat cancer\n- Elimination of cancer cells in lymphoma and leukemia\n- Increasing the efficacy of CD47 blockage by targeting cancer cells for phagocytosis\n\nAdvantages:\n- Synergizes CD47 blockade with binding to tumor antigens and induction of phagocytosis\n- Versatile method that can accommodate the targeting of a plethora of tumor antigens\n- Function is confined to a single, bispecific antibody which simplifies formulations",

Of interest is corneal injury, for example after refractive surgery or crosslinking, e.g. LASIK and PRK, and also after corneal infections and ulcers, such as bacterial, viral and fungal infections of the cornea. For example, burns and injury to the cornea can lead to permanent scarring of the cornea and loss of vision. In the case of burns and severe injuries, preserving vision requires preventing fibrosis during the healing process, and facilitating transparent, \"scarless\" tissue regeneration. Currently, there are no FDA approved treatments that addresses the main cause of corneal blindness after injury, which is the formation of fibrotic scars that degrade or completely block vision. A topical therapy that can blunt or eliminate the formation of scars may enable patients to avoid an invasive surgery such as a corneal transplant to remove the scar. Verteporfin, a benzoporphyrin derivative, was FDA approved more than two decades ago as an intravenous injection with photodynamic therapy to treat choroidal neovascularization in the eye, and has been shown to be safe for use with that indication. The drug has been shown to prevent fibrosis in several human organs including the lung, skin, liver and kidney and can be dosed safely in the skin in previous animal studies with minimal side effects.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have developed a new, better binder for the tumor-associated macrophage marker CD206. This binder can be conjugated to a variety of payloads, including an anti-immune checkpoint protein antibody for more selective immune checkpoint blockade.\n\nImmune checkpoint proteins expressed on the surface of immune cells inhibit their activity and prevent excessive immune responses. In cancer, the overactivation of these proteins can prevent the immune system from killing cancer cells. Antibodies that re-activate the immune system by blocking checkpoint proteins (\"checkpoint blockade\") can therefore treat a wide variety of cancers. However, these drugs can cause dangerous side effects by also activating healthy immune cells, causing the immune system to attack both cancer and healthy tissues.\n\nStanford researchers therefore invented a new class of checkpoint inhibitors that selectively act on immune cells involved in cancer. These molecules comprise a novel binder for CD206, a marker expressed on tumor-associated macrophages (\"TAMs,\" immune cells that contribute to cancer progression) conjugated to an antibody that binds but does not inhibit a checkpoint protein.

    "ip_description": "The DeSimone Research Group at Stanford University developed a method for fabricating 3D pyrolytic carbon structures from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) generated by a scalable Vat Polymerization 3D-printing continuous liquid interface production (CLIP) process. PAN is popular for generating conductive high-strength carbon fibers commonly used in lightweight structural applications including battery systems for sustainable energy storage. However, because PAN is insoluble in its own AN monomer, it precipitates to form powder during VP 3D printing making it impossible to print. In response, the DeSimone Research Group developed this multi-step fabrication method for producing 3D carbon structures from PAN (See **Figure** below):\n\n*   A sacrificial crosslinked gel lattice scaffold is 3D CLIP printed.\n*   The gel scaffold is infused with acrylonitrile monomers and a thermal initiator.\n*   The acrylonitrile polymerizes inside the gel scaffold forming an interpenetrating polymer network.\n*   Finally, the PAN-infused gel lattice structure is thermally treated (e.g. an oxidative pre-treatment, isothermal holds, and/or pyrolysis) that converts the PAN to 3D pyrolytic carbon.\n\nThe method incorporates PAN into 3D-printed high-resolution lattice structures via CLIP which following pyrolysis yields 3D lightweight electrode; This VP 3D-printing and gel infusion method can be used to pioneer the incorporation of other linear polymers, like polyethylene and polyimides, into high-resolution lattice structures.\n\nResearchers at the Lu Group, UC Merced, have pioneered a method to create 3D pyrolytic carbon with an exceptionally high surface area, boosted by the inclusion of 1D carbon nanostructures. This method involves incorporating various catalysts either on the surface or within 3D printed polymers. The process enhances impingement through pressure, temperature, or evaporation-assisted techniques.\n\nThere are **five** roles these catalyst systems will fulfill:\n\n1.  Promoting the formation of graphitic carbon precursor\n2.  Coordination bonding to increase char yield\n3.  Graphitization\n4.  Carbon metal composite framework to prevent severe shrinkage during polymer pyrolysis, and enhance the mechanical integrity and electrical conductivity.\n5.  The growth of 1D carbon nanostructures to enhance the electrical conductivity and surface area of the pyrolytic carbon.\n\nBelow is a process in **steps**:\n\n*   **Catalyst and Biomass Precursor Infusion**: The 3D printed template is immersed in a solution containing catalysts and biomass (such as sugar). During controlled solvent evaporation under elevated temperatures, the dehydrated biomass derivatives react with unreacted vinyl groups in the resin, forming carbon.\n*   **Primary Structure Formation**: The polymer template infused with catalyst undergoes pyrolysis under an inert atmosphere, solidifying the structure.\n*   **Secondary Structure Growth**: 1D carbon nanostructures are grown by introducing a gaseous carbon precursor, further increasing surface area and conductivity.\n*   **Functionalization (Tertiary Structure)**: Electrografting tertiary species onto the secondary structure imbues the final product with application-specific functionalities.\n\n**Stage of Development \u2013 Proof of Concept**\nThe Lu and DeSimone Research Groups are optimizing the process based on detailed electrochemical, mechanical, and surface topology characterization analyses to achieve optimal conductivity, char yield, and mechanical properties.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   **Batteries for grid energy storage and EVs** - 3D Printed, PAN-based pyrolytic carbon lattice structures for redox flow and EV batteries.\n*   **CO2 recapture** - pyrolytic carbon lattice electrocatalysis for high-throughput reactions such as the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction and other reactions requiring high volumetric-density electrochemically active surface area and to facilitate mass transport.\n*   Bio and environmental sensing.\n*   Chemical production via electrification.\n*   Support for electrocatalysis to enable hydrogen economy.\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   The secondary and tertiary structures enable the extremely high volumetric chemical reaction hitherto unattainable.\n*   **First in class** fabrication of acrylonitrile swelled and polymerized in a 3D-printed gel structure followed by pyrolysis to create revolutionary 3D lattice carbon structures.\n*   **Excellent electrical** conductivity, strong **chemical** stability, and excellent **mechanical properties**.\n*   **Quick, high resolution, scalable Vat Polymerization 3D-printing** via CLIP.\n*   One step pyrolysis process combining graphitization and secondary carbon nanostructure growth.\n*   The multifunctionality of the catalysts is the key for highly electrically conductive, mechanically robust, 3D structures that offer easily accessible, extremely large surface areas.\n*   Green fabrication through minimal chemical usage when biomass is used and hierarchical carbon nanostructure is formed in situ.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed an inducible and programmable CRISPR-mediated transcript organization (CRISPR-TO) method for repositioning RNAs to various desired subcellular compartments. Spatial RNA transcriptomics, including subcellular mRNA localization, is a core mechanism for spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis. For example, neurons with large axons tend to spatially localize key mRNAs to the tip of axons to coordinate axon guidance and growth cone development. Mounting evidence has begun to correlate the dysregulation of mRNA localization to an increasing number of diseases, in particular neurological diseases. However, despite decades of effort, the mechanistic and functional importance of RNA spatial localization has only been explored for a few key examples, largely due to a lack of efficient and programmable approaches that allow for the manipulation of any endogenous RNA localization in cells. The inventors have developed methods of localizing RNA in a cell in which a localization polypeptide and RNA carrier polypeptide form an intracellular molecular transport dimerization pair. The method is both inducible, and can deliver a guide RNA to various subcellular locations within a cell. Applications include using CRISPR-TO to efficiently manipulate the spatial localization of repetitive reporter mRNAs, localization of GAPDH mRNAs or GCN4 reporter mRNAs to p-bodies, stress granules, minus ends of microtubules, plus ends of microtubules, tellers and nuclear stress bodies in HeLa cells, localization of endogenous mRNAs to the projections of primary neurons, the recruitment of mRNA to the terminals of neuronal projections in primary mouse hippocampal neurons, and localization of OMM mRNA to promote the import of translated proteins into mitochondria.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed methods to link antigenic or immunomodulatory molecules to bacterial surface proteins of commensal bacteria that result in a high immune response when applied to an epithelial surface of a mammal. Commensal microbiota reside primarily at barrier sites, such as the gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract and skin, where they functionally tune the innate and adaptive immune systems. Immune tolerance to these microbes must be established at each of these contact sites. Treg cells play a major role in establishing and maintaining immune homeostasis in peripheral tissues, particularly at barrier sites where they stably reside. In contrast, T effector cells generally amplify pro-inflammatory responses in an antigen-specific manner. The authors have previously developed novel methods for stimulating and expanding antigen-specific Tregs and T effector cells with TCRs specific for a specific host antigen of interest. The inventors have devised a method to present antigens linked to commensal bacterial surface proteins which results in a surprisingly high immune response triggered when the bacterial are applied to an epithelial surface of a mammal. This method comprises the expression of an extracellular bacterial protein selected from the group consisting of Accumulation-associated protein (Aap), peptidoglycan, an M protein, Lysing Motif (LysM)-containing protein and a peptidoglycan-binding protein, or a fragment linked to a heterologous antigenic molecule or immunomodulatory molecule. Applications include linkage of an antigen molecule on any bacterial surface protein or other bacterial wall molecule, attachment of antigens to bacterial surface proteins, fusion of an extracellular protein with a first affinity agent, click chemistry compatibility that can link the antigenic molecule to a polypeptide on the bacterial surface using an alkyne or azide moiety, coating bacteria non-specifically on their surface with an antigenic or immunomodulatory molecule, and use of non-protein molecules as antigenic molecules, i.e. lipids or polysaccharides.

Urine is assayed alongside blood in medicine, however current clinical diagnostic tests exploit only a minor fraction of its biomolecular repertoire, thereby foregoing high-resolution insights into human health and disease. For instance, current state-of-the-art liquid biopsies are largely focused on nucleic acids in blood plasma. Urine is the ultra-filtrate of blood; some molecules that are present at very low levels in the blood are hyper-concentrated in urine, offering an orthogonal readout to a plasma liquid biopsy. Additionally, urine provides a direct, noninvasive window into the health and functioning of cell types and tissues with low representation in blood. Therefore, the replacement or use of a urine liquid biopsy relative to current clinical readouts on urine (e.g., albumin, urine dipstick, serum creatinine, etc.) may provide a more direct readout into underlying disease. The inventors have developed methods of detecting cell-free RNA (cfRNA) as well as metabolites in urine samples. This method can be applied as a direct readout for disease, for example as a method of evaluating kidney function, prostate function, or bladder function in a human. Applications include characterization of the urine transcriptomic landscape, urine liquid biopsies exhibiting distinct cell types of origin from the plasma cell-free RNA transcriptome, and untargeted metabolomics for a functional readout of the urinary metabolic landscape.

    "ip_description": "Blood cell transfusion plays a vital role in modern medicine\u2013supporting surgery, obstetrics, trauma care, and cancer chemotherapy. In the US alone, more than 12 million red-cell units are consumed annually. However, the availability is contingent on donor material, resulting in supply constraints and safety concerns. Globally, shortages pose a significant healthcare challenge, expected to worsen with aging populations and diminishing donor numbers. To address these growing medical needs, ex vivo manufacture of red blood cells (RBCs) from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) producer lines emerges as a renewable and scalable solution that offer potential benefits compared to donor blood, including a lower risk of infectious disease transmission, streamlined production, product uniformity, and ability to source or genetically engineer antigen-negative cells. However, this approach remains extremely costly, owing in large part to purified, clinical-grade recombinant cytokines required to stimulate producer cells for expansion and differentiation into erythroid cells. Because erythropoietin (EPO) signaling through the EPO receptor (EPOR) is indispensable to RBC development, of all components in erythroid-promoting media, EPO is by far the most costly.\n\nMethods: We used the latest synthetic biology tools and genome engineering technologies to de-couple EPOR signaling from the EPO cytokine. Specifically, we devised a series of FKBP-EPOR chimeras that exchanged the requirement for native EPO ligand with an exogenous, orthogonal rapalog small molecule (SM) which we termed inducible EPORs (iEPORs). These were site-specifically inserted in vitro into primary human hematopoietic cells (HSCs) via CRISPR/AAV-mediated genome editing at various HSC and RBC-relevant loci (CCR5 with the PGK and SFFV promoters, EPOR, and HBA1). Using flow cytometry and ddPCR-based assays, we determined the fidelity (i.e., responsivity to SM) and potency (ability to drive differentiation from a stem cell state towards the erythroid lineage) of various iEPOR constructs (different signal peptides and extracellular and intracellular domain modifications) as well as the impact of inserting these chimeras at the aforementioned loci.\n\nResults & Discussion: We first optimized iEPOR constructs through a highly effective signal peptide present on IL6 and inclusion of the naturally occurring intracellular domain truncation known to enhance erythropoiesis. Together, these modifications allowed us to drive HSCs to 100% differentiation into RBCs in the presence of the iEPOR-dimerizing small molecule. However, we also observed 26.2% differentiation in the absence of any endogenous or exogenous erythroid-biasing ligand. To increase the fidelity of our iEPOR, we integrated our iEPOR at the CCR5 locus and drove expression using the PGK promoter to ablate ligand-independent differentiation (**Figure 1A**). This identical HSC response to iEPOR in the presence of our small molecule versus native HSC in the presence of EPO was corroborated not only by flow cytometry-based markers of erythroid differentiation but also via HPLC-based assessment of hemoglobin A and F production. iEPOR-integrated HSCs differentiated as described clustered with natively differentiated HSCs vs undifferentiated HSCs by PCA covariance plots and differential gene expression heatmaps (**Figure 1B**). We observed effectively identical counts of hemoglobin RNA supporting our HPLC findings. Finally, we integrated our optimized iEPOR construct into an iPSC line and devised a consolidated, differentiation strategy from induced pluripotent stem cells to HSCs and, ultimately, RBCs (**Figure 1C**). Together, this proves our approach serves an ex vivo, EPO-independent RBC production strategy that closely mimics native EPOR signaling by surface biomarkers, relevant protein output, and transcriptional profile. By our calculation, 1nM of dimerizer is approximately 500-fold less costly than 3U/mL of EPO cytokine. This would therefore reduce the cost of EPO cytokine required to generate a single unit of RBCs from $2,760 to approximately $6. Given that dependence on costly cytokines is a common barrier to production of cell-based therapeutics, in the future we believe the strategies defined in this work may enable scalable and renewable ex vivo production of a wide variety of clinically relevant cell types including platelets, neutrophils, T cells.\n\nApplications:\n- Hemoglobinopathies\n\nAdvantages:\n- Greater efficacy by inducing bias in transplanted HSC to yield higher RBC production.\n- Lower toxic and mutagenic regimens are required to stimulate high RBC production.\n- Easy integration into current treatment workflow.",

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), certain chromosomal translocations correlate with a good prognosis, while some deletions or duplications are linked to an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. The ability to quickly determine specific cancer mutations provides a clinical advantage and opportunity for precise delivery of targeted therapies. However, detecting cancer gene fusion is very difficult with current methods. The Ji Research Group overcomes the associated issues by physically isolating target gene fusion from non-targets and from the wild-type, non-rearranged genes. Their method targets a specific locus prone to rearrangement via an initial PCR based prescreen, and multiplexes for different targets specific to a given cancer, which greatly increases the efficiency of the process. The target sites are excised with CRISPR edits, and the high molecular weight DNA targets are isolated. A simple quantitative PCR assay provides an initial, high sensitivity detection that is then followed by long read nanopore sequencing for more extensive sequence characterization of the gene mutation. This diagnostic method identifies and characterizes specific genomic aberrations in cancer types that can be used to more accurately provide diagnoses, prognoses, and targeted therapies.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers within the Cui Lab have discovered a promising practical application for grid-scale energy storage by solving poor electronic conductivity in Mn based aqueous batteries, resulting in cycling with an ultrahigh areal loading of 20 mAh cm-2 for over 200 cycles with only 13% capacity loss. Poor electronic conductivity of electro-deposited MnO2 is a key critical problem that limits the maximum specific areal loading, producing only a thin layer of MnO2 with low areal loading (around 0.005~0.05 mAh cm-2) during the charge/discharge cycle. Stanford researchers discovered, by tuning the temperature, the deposited phase of MnO2 can be manipulated from -?-MnO2 with low conductivity to ?-MnO2 with 2 orders of magnitude increase in conductivity. Applications include potential use for manganese-hydrogen and manganese-zinc aqueous batteries in grid-scale energy storage. Advantages include being more efficient, scalable, lower overall cost for manganese-based batteries, and safer than fire-risk lithium-ion batteries.

HCC is one of the most common cancers and has a dismal prognosis as currently available medical treatment only improves survival by a few months. Current guidelines only focus on screening patients for HCC with cirrhotic stage liver disease. However, that 30-40% of all NASH-related HCCs occur in non-cirrhotic livers. These patients often present at a late stage when they are not eligible for liver transplant, and other treatment modalities are very limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new screening strategies and develop new biomarkers to improve survival of these patients.\n\nInventors at Stanford have developed an animal model with NASH and hydrodynamically-induced HCC. Using genetic approaches and inhibitors of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and crosslink inhibitors, inventors discovered that liver AGEs promoted HCC in vivo by increasing tissue viscoelasticity. Viscoelasticity could be modulated by targeting AGE deposition and collagen crosslinking. Higher viscoelasticity promoted HCC cell spread and migration in a novel 3D hydrogel model with high viscoelasticity.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have created a de novo protein design platform that designs binding proteins that specifically target antigens in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Designing proteins capable of specific targeting of antigens can be transformative and enhance CAR-T treatments. MHCs are protein molecules that bind pathogen-associated or damage-associated molecular patterns and display them on the surface of cells for recognition by the immune system. T cell receptors (TCRs) have evolved to recognize the peptide identities on the MHC-peptide complexes via interaction with both the antigenic peptide and the MHC. There have been significant efforts to engineer TCRs to allow improved recognition and destruction of virus-infected cells or cancer. However, TCR engineering remains a challenge due to its structural complexity. The creation of a non-TCR protein platform to design functional mimetics of TCRs that recognize the MHC-peptide complexes can overcome the challenges associated with TCR engineering. Proteins that specifically bind to an MHC-peptide complex of interest are designed using computer-based protein engineering and high throughput screening assays. The designed binding protein, or TRACeR, is simpler in structure than TCRs, and comprises an antigenic peptide recognition element and an MHC recognition element. Selected binders are screened for binding strength against thymic epithelial cells to minimize cross-reactivity with self-MHC-peptides. Importantly, TRACeRs have been tested in CAR-T cells and have positive killing results.

RIPPA aims to streamline the laborious processes involved in isolating relevant peptide/MHC-II characteristics necessary for T cell epitope discovery both experimentally and computationally. The specificity of T cell responses relies on the recognition of unique peptides presented by MHC-II molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. However, the heterogeneity of MHC-II alleles and labor-intensive purification process across currently employed methods, results in lengthy screening periods often ranging between 4-6 months. RIPPA enables a much larger panel of MHC-II alleles to be screened within a short time frame and in a cost-efficient manner. By genetically modifying an array of yeast cell clones to express a specific MHC-II allele in their native-like format, RIPPA quickly screens pathogenic peptides for their binding to tens to hundreds of MHC-II alleles over the span of a month. Characterization of relevant peptide/MHC-II characteristics will guide T cell research and therapeutic endeavors involving T cell-dependent immunity. Furthermore, RIPPA's ability to generate a vast amount of peptide/MHC-II binding data will propel computational approaches for T cell epitope discovery.

In addition to the shortage of ?-globin, the accumulation of ?-globin is also a significant contributor to disease pathology, driven by expression from two highly homologous genes, HBA1 and HBA2. Stanford researchers have optimized a CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing technique to replace one of the two genes encoding ?-globin with a functional version of HBB. Despite the similarity of the HBA1 and HBA2 genes, the inventors have developed highly selective CRISPR guide sequences that can specifically knock-in the HBB gene into the HBA1 locus, leaving the HBA2 gene intact. The resulting gene expression profile produces a normalized ratio of ?-globin and ?-globin to restore functional hemoglobin. Researchers demonstrate that hematopoietic stem cells can be edited efficiently to replace HBA1 with HBB, and successfully engraft and reconstitute in a mouse model to restore hemoglobin levels. Due to the redundancy of alpha-globin genes and the fact that site-specific integration at the HBA1 locus achieves a red blood cell-specific expression profile of custom transgenes, this technology has broad clinical application outside of thalassemia. Ongoing Research: Researchers find that in patient-derived cells they were able to: 1) efficiently edit HSPCs; 2) normalize the ratio of beta-globin:alpha-globin; 3) restore functional hemoglobin; and 4) successfully engraft edited cells into mice.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have created a system that enables efficient fabrication of complex three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures via triplet-triplet-annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC). There is a growing interest in fabricating complex micro and nanoscale 3D structures for various clinical and research applications. One of the most well-established techniques for nanoscale 3D fabrication is two-photon polymerization (2PP). However, 2PP is slow and expensive, because it uses high-powered lasers that allow for only monovoxel printing per light source. Researchers at Stanford have proposed TTA-UC, which uses lower power sources, as an alternative to 2PP. Materials involved in this process contain a sensitizer-annihilator pair, a photoinitiator, and monomers. The sensitizer absorbs lower energy photons to make the annihilator emits higher-energy photons. The photoinitiator then triggers the assembly of the monomers, or polymerization by absorbing the upconverted photons. The researchers have identified a resin with an ideal ratio of appropriate components for TTA-UC. They then demonstrated that TTA-UC can be parallelized by incorporating a digital micromirror device to project millions of voxels simultaneously. Additionally, they developed algorithm that makes grayscale and sparser versions of the intended design to prevent unintended polymerization in neighboring pixels, allowing them to print more complex 3D structures. Applications include fabrication of nanotools in the fields of plasmonics, nanophotonics, microoptics, nanooptics, robotics, biomedicine, and extended reality.

ML (machine learning) models 'at the edge' on resource-constrained devices is difficult, due to limited memory and a strict power budget. The Stanford researchers used quantized and heavily pruned bottleneck-based networks with dense custom latch arrays (CLAs), to create a tight, integrated compute and memory device. Their low-read-energy, dense CLAs and high degree of parallelism of their dense compute fabric facilitate dataflow with inputs and outputs only read/write once.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a method enabling quantification of intracellular protein levels using oligonucleotide-barcoded antibodies. Multiplexing single cell technologies affords researchers the ability to characterize cell states and identify gene regulatory programs across various cell types. The application of sequencing-based surface protein quantification using barcoded antibodies to intracellular or nuclear protein targets has been challenging. Nuclear targets are particularly challenging due to high levels of background oligo-antibody staining, potentially driven by the conjugated single stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligo. However, quantification of nuclear transcription factors, the drivers of gene regulation, would enable critical understanding of gene regulatory processes. For this reason, several approaches to reduce non-specific staining include saturating cells with single stranded nucleic acids or other charged polymers to block non-specific binding to ssDNA oligos. The inventors have developed methods quantify intracellular and nuclear targets within a single cell using antibodies conjugated to barcoded oligonucleotides. The inventors reduced non-specific oligo-antibody staining by coating the conjugated ssDNA oligo with single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs). The inventors demonstrate the utility of this technology in profiling CD4 memory T cells by combining SSB-coated oligo-antibodies in nuclear protein quantification with ATAC-seq and RNA-seq (NEAT-seq). Applications include directly measuring single cell protein levels of cytoplasmic or nuclear targets, like transcription factors, with improved signal over background, and oligo-antibody staining in combination with other single cell genomic measurements (e.g., ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, Hi-C, etc.) or perturbating screening for comprehensive cell profiling. Advantages include a modular and flexible design that can be applied to any target binding moiety (e.g., antibody fragment, ligand, aptamer, etc.) and incorporation to existing single cell pipelines (i.e., split-pool protocols and microfluidics), single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs) that bind with high affinity to ssDNA in a sequence non-specific manner, with low affinity for nuclear dsDNA, and SSBs that are compatible with oligo PCR amplification steps during library generation.",

    "ip_number": "S23-082",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have proposed that coating surgical sutures with mechanotransduction inhibitors may reduce scarring of the tissue. When the skin or other tissues are wounded, the body initiates a healing process. While shallow wounds may heal without a scar, injuries involving thicker tissues, such as the dermis or fascia, often lead to visible scars characterized by abnormal color, contour, rugosity, and breaking strength. Over time, scars may improve in appearance and breaking strength as collagen structures remodel and blood vessels form. However, these characteristics will never fully match those of normal (unwounded) skin, and certain functional elements like hair follicles and sweat glands do not regenerate, resulting in permanent functional losses. Currently, there is no therapeutic strategy to either prevent or reverse scarring. Upon learning that the primary pathway responsible for scar formation is mechanotransduction, Stanford researchers studied the impact of mechanotransduction inhibitors on fibrosis. Inhibitors targeting proteins such as Focal Adhesion Kinase, Yes Associated Protein, Piezo1 and Piezo2 effectively reduced scarring, restoring both appearance and full function. Surgical sutures, used to close open tissues or attach medical devices, present a promising avenue for scar prevention. Coating sutures with any or combinations of the mechanotransduction inhibitors could reduce future scarring. Also, these sutures could be used in scar revision surgeries to reverse scarring. Applications include skin wounds (ex. Incisional wounds or burns), postpartum recovery, surgeries involving joining tissues, medical device implant, laparotomy surgery, scar revision surgery, organ fibrosis, and pathological skin scarring conditions (Dupuytren's disease, fibrotic dermal scarring, hypertrophic scarring, keloid scarring, corneal and other ocular tissue scarring).

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have invented protein degraders that induce lysosomal degradation of extracellular cargo. These protein degraders can be used to promote the degradation of integrins, which have implications in several fibrotic diseases, and serve as a highly effective therapeutic for patients suffering from fibrosis. Organ fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), which ultimately disrupt normal tissue architecture and functions. For example, renal fibrosis affects 800 million people worldwide and dialysis treatment is becoming a significant economic burden. As the principal ECM receptor, integrins are implicated in diverse fibrotic diseases such as renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and scleroderma fibrosis. Despite the tremendous interest, the development of inhibitors focusing on integrins has faced substantial challenges such as low in vivo efficacy, undesired effects, lack of tissue specificity, and integrin subtype specificity. Protein degraders of integrins have resulted in the first known class of integrin inactivators that induce degradation of a cell-surface integrin via lysosomal targeting instead of simply blocking integrin activity. Importantly, targeting integrins in this manner addresses the four key challenges mentioned in the previous paragraph. Consequently, inducing degradation of integrins can drastically improve fibrosis treatment efficacy and transform the fibrotic disease medical field.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "To manage the development and progression of glaucoma, researchers at Stanford University have developed a biocompatible suprachoroidal spacer implant. This implant leverages a specialized delivery system into the suprachoroidal space, and effectively lowers the intraocular pressure (IOP). Elevated IOP is a major risk factor for glaucoma, which is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. While there are several methods to reduce IOP, each approach has inherent limitations. Daily eyedrop administration can be compromised by patient medication adherence and limited tolerability; laser procedures are not adequately effective for many patients; current surgical procedures damage the conjunctiva and are ultimately compromised by scarring; and sustained-release drug-loaded implants may damage the anterior chamber and in any case only last months. As a promising alternative, Stanford researchers have developed a suprachoroidal implant effective at lowering IOP. The implant can be delivered by a custom microneedle injector that is designed to avoid requiring any suturing after delivery, and therefore can be performed in the outpatient clinic setting. Being able to lower intraocular pressure with a one-time treatment that can be performed in the clinic and without needing to go to the operating room could revolutionize glaucoma care. Upon implantation within the suprachoroidal space, uveoscleral aqueous outflow increases, leading to a sustained reduction in IOP. Delivery and data validation in relevant laboratory models has been achieved. The researchers have prototypes of the implant and the injector that are being actively improved and optimized. They have completed _ex vivo_ experiments and are preparing for _in vivo_ studies. Applications include lowering IOP to mediate conditions such as Glaucoma, Ocular hypertension, Exfoliation syndrome, and Pigment dispersion syndrome. Advantages include long-term IOP control without daily management, monolithic implant with structural integrity, biocompatible, minimally invasive, office-based procedure, easy to deploy in underdeveloped setting, does not hinder the ability to perform additional glaucoma surgery, no cyclodialysis cleft, merging the anterior chamber with the suprachoroidal space, no anterior chamber manipulation and no expected endothelial cell loss, and precise injection with customized injector.",

The multi-channel stimulation proposed is favorably delivered to the fingertips. However, it can also be applied to other parts of the hand and, in general, to other parts of the body. This new treatment can induce long-lasting, sustained therapeutic effects that outlast cessation of stimulation, so that a few hours of stimulation delivered regularly or occasionally may provide substantial relief. First in man study showed promising preliminary results. The recently published paper is listed below. Stage of Research: A first in man study based on vibrotactile coordinated reset stimulation (CRS) completed. CRS consists of spatiotemporal sequences of stimuli delivered to different sites in the brain. It is believed to be the first demonstration that vibrotactile CRS is safe and tolerable and improves gait and bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease. Moreover, there was still improvement one and four weeks after stimulation was stopped, suggesting a cumulative and long-lasting effect of the stimulation. Applications: Treatment of brain disorders characterized by abnormal neuronal synchrony such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, dysfunction after stroke, and movement disorders (e.g. essential tremor, dystonia). Advantages: This new device is easy-to-develop, easy-to-test, and easy-to-implement. Non-invasive, thus avoiding risks associated with invasive treatments such as deep brain stimulation.

The 3D bioprinting technology uses biomaterials and cells to construct functional 3D structures with potential applications as tissues, organs, or drug delivery vehicles. Polylactic acid (PLA) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) are commonly used for bioprinting due to their mechanical integrity and biodegradability, but they pose a risk of an inflammatory response as their acidic degradation byproducts accumulate. PCL, another robust biodegradable biomaterial, produces fewer acidic byproducts. It is a promising alternative when blended with gelatin, which has fast degradation kinetics. Although Homogeneous PCL gelatin (PG) blends have been made before using electrospinning, the resulting products were limited in geometry and lacked consistency in fiber quality. Stanford researchers have devised a methodology to fabricate a more versatile homogeneous PG composite with tunable degradation kinetics and high biocompatibility. Gelatin nanoparticles embedded in this composite can be taken up by cells to enhance proliferation and differentiation. This bioactivity persists even after repeated exposure to high temperatures (>100 \u00b0C). Therefore, the new PG composite can be extruded into bioactive 3D filaments to be used for a variety of biofabrication applications. The researchers have completed in vitro assessments of cell proliferation and toxicity and in vivo implantations in rats to establish safety and efficacy. Applications include regenerative medicine research, drug testing, bone grafting, tissue repair, controlled-release drug delivery, and biocompatible implants. Advantages include biocompatibility with limited immunogenicity, fast and tunable degradation, gelatin nanoparticles that aid cell proliferation and differentiation, the ability to withstand repeated exposure to high temperatures while retaining bioactivity, and high customizability in final construct geometry.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a high-sensitivity cell-based assay for predicting the innate immune response to recombinant adeno-associated virus. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has enabled the development of transformative gene therapies for disorders ranging from spinal muscular atrophy to hemophilia B. However, the use of rAAV is limited by its immunogenicity, which can result in reduced therapeutic efficacy as well as dangerous and even deadly reactions in patients. While rAAV engineering promises less immunogenic vectors, these efforts are hindered by a lack of tools for predicting immunogenicity pre-clinically. Animal models have very different immune systems from humans, while cell-based models are non-physiological and display poor immune responses to rAAV. Assays employing human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are similarly limited by wide variability between donors and low sensitivity. To address this challenge, Stanford researchers developed a new tool for predicting innate immune responses to rAAV. rAAV capsids are first opsonized (tagged for recognition by the immune system) with an anti-AAV monoclonal antibody and then incubated with human PBMCs. PBMC immune activation can be measured by cytokine production or the expression of T-cell activation markers. Researchers showed that opsonization enabled immune responses from otherwise unresponsive PBMCs and discrimination between closely related but differentially immunogenic rAAVs. Stage of Development: In vitro: assay elicits an rAAV-induced immune response in otherwise unresponsive PBMCs that increases with exposure to unmethylated CpGs. Applications: Tools for rAAV research, Clinical development of rAAV-mediated vaccines and gene therapies, Validation of lot-to-lot rAAV consistency during manufacturing, Basis for human subject inclusion or exclusion in rAAV clinical trials, Companion diagnostic for evaluating patient suitability for rAAV gene therapies. Advantages: High sensitivity, Simple, in vitro assay, Distinguishes immune responses towards closely related rAAV vectors, Predicts immune responses without the need for animal models, Overcomes issues with variability between PBMC donors.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a strategy for secondary wastewater treatment using a membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) design that enables the simultaneous removal of pollutants and recovery of potent greenhouse gas (N2O) emissions. Conventional domestic wastewater treatment is based on aerobic processes, resulting in a large carbon footprint due to high energy consumption and N2O emissions during biological nitrogen removal. A recent systems-level analysis emphasizes that carbon footprint due to N2O emissions is more significant than the footprint resulting from energy use. Anaerobic secondary treatment has been proposed to enable energy-efficient removal of organic matter but will have similar N2O emissions in a post-treatment for biological nitrogen removal. A method for N2O emission control is clearly needed. To address this, Stanford researchers developed a novel strategy where a membrane-aerated bioreactor (MABR) is incorporated for both aerobic secondary treatment and tertiary treatment after anaerobic secondary treatment to recover N2O produced during biological nitrogen treatment. Biofilm attached to gas permeable membrane surfaces in the MABR effectively remove biodegradable compounds from the aqueous phase, enabling low energy consumption. The biofilms also create a driving force for counter diffusion of N2O from the membrane-attached biofilm into the lumen of the membranes. This driving force increases N2O concentration within the lumen, facilitating recovery of N2O-enriched off-gas and minimization in carbon footprint. The N2O-enriched off-gas can be used for energy production in a biogas engine or in a system that recovers combined heat and power (CHP). Stage of Development: Pilot: treatment of 4,320 gallons of secondary effluent per day at the Silicon Valley Clean Water wastewater treatment facility, enabling recovery of > 99% N2O with a low energy requirement (0.06 kWh/m3).

    "ip_name": "Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Management of Enteric Diseases",
    "ip_number": "S07-230",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "There is an urgent need for the development of sensitive, specific and non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of patients with enteropathic diseases such as celiac sprue. Such biomarkers could be used in primary screening of potential patients, definitive diagnosis of suspected patients, monitoring response to therapies, drug compliance assessment, and cost-effective drug development. Two such biomarkers, summarized below, have been invented and patented at Stanford University. For simplicity, the descriptions that follow are limited to their relevance to celiac sprue, although application to other enteric diseases (e.g. inflammatory bowel diseases) is also anticipated.\n\nBackground:\n\nCurrent diagnostic methods for celiac sprue are based on serum antibody tests, a small bowel biopsy, and a clinical response to a gluten-free diet. Although antibody tests are fairly specific, patients must be exposed to the discomfort of high doses of gluten over extended durations before they seroconvert. Whereas small bowel biopsies are the 'gold standard', they are obtained via invasive and expensive endoscopic procedures; their handling and examination requires considerable expertise and is often subjective. Clinical signs and symptoms associated with celiac sprue are variable, even in the same patient, and therefore not particularly useful. For example, although patients with active celiac sprue show statistically significant differences in fat or xylose absorption or lactulose permeability compared to patients in remission, these markers are peripherally related to celiac sprue immunopathogenesis, and can undergo significant changes due to factors unrelated to the disease. There is therefore an urgent need for biomarkers that complement the strengths and weaknesses of serological and histological tests in the context of diagnosis.\n\nAlthough a definitive path for celiac sprue drug development has not been established, ongoing efforts are based on clinical protocols that are adapted from existing diagnostic practices. For example, changes in histology, serology, fat or xylose absorption, lactulose permeability, and gastrointestinal symptoms are generally monitored either in the context of a gluten challenge (if the protective capacity of the drug candidate is being evaluated) or along the normal course of recovery (if the ability of the drug candidate to accelerate full recovery is being evaluated). There is an urgent need for 'scaleable biomarkers' that can serve as useful, preferably primary, endpoints in early proof-of-concept clinical trials as well as late-stage registration trials.\nOn a longer-term horizon, as new drugs for celiac sprue are approved, one can anticipate a need for biomarkers that facilitate assessment of compliance and response to therapy. Not only would this enhance the physician's ability to manage the patient's life-long disease, but it would also add value to selected drugs in an increasingly competitive market.\n\nThe Technologies:\n\n*   (1) By altering key residues in naturally occurring gluten peptide, a family of synthetic peptide biomarkers has been designed to mimic immunotoxic gluten peptides in terms of their resistance to gastrointestinal proteases and susceptibility to therapeutic glutenases. However, in contrast to immunotoxic gluten peptides (e.g. the 33-mer), these biomarkers are neither substrates of human transglutaminase 2 nor are they high-affinity ligands for HLA-DQ2. Consequently, these biomarkers are non-inflammatory, and carbon-13, hydrogen-2, or alternatively labeled versions can safely be administered orally to celiac sprue patients in conjunction with a drug or placebo. If the drug is a glutenase, then the levels of the labeled amino acids in bodily fluids such as serum, breath or urine provide insight into the efficacy of a drug such as an oral glutenase. If the drug modulates the response of celiac mucosa to gluten via other mechanisms, then the level of the labeled peptide itself (or a partially proteolyzed metabolite) in a bodily fluid is useful for assessing the extent of leakiness of the epithelial barrier of the celiac small intestine. The latter analytical measurement could also be used in the context of other inflammatory bowel diseases where mucosal leakiness is elevated.\n*   (2) The second biomarker technology is designed as a non-invasive, quantitative surrogate for the small bowel biopsy in celiac sprue. Certain xenobiotic cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP3A4, are highly active in enterocytes as well as liver cells. However, in contrast to the liver, where their expression level is relatively constant, CYP3A levels can fluctuate significantly in the small bowel. For example, CYP3A4 is abundant in enterocytes near villous tips but not near the crypts, suggesting that CYP3A4 activity correlates with enterocyte maturity. Dietary gluten is known to induce abnormal enterocyte morphology and physiology in celiac patients. Consequently, celiac patients with active disease have decreased CYP3A4 protein and activity levels in their small intestine, both of which recover to normal after introduction of a gluten-free diet. Thus, the efficacy of a celiac drug can be conveniently monitored using intestinal CYP3A4 activity as a surrogate for gluten-induced enteropathy. For example, the widely used drug, simvastatin, is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 in the small intestine. Changes in the Cmax and AUC of oral simvastatin could therefore be correlated with the early onset of villus damage in a celiac sprue patient. Pending clinical proof-of-concept, the test could be readily adapted into a finger-stick or urine test format.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Biomarkers for diagnosis and drug development for celiac disease, and potentially other enteric diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   Large potential impact - 1 in 200 people are affected by celiac disease\n*   Less invasive than bowel biopsy\n*   Complements existing histological & serological tests",

Transplants are often life-saving treatments and with a limited organ supply optimizing preservation during transit is crucial for enhancing access and health outcomes. The current standard for donor organ preservation involves a sterile ice-filled cooler ranging between 2-4\u00b0C. While a low temperature is necessary to slow tissue deterioration, recent studies indicate that such low temperatures might also increase the risk of freeze-related injury, limiting the organ's transplant viability. A storage temperature closer to 10\u00b0C could offer better preservation, but no existing portable system can maintain this range for an extended period. MoTEC, a thermoelectric cooler designed to keep a donor organ at a stable 10\u00b0C (+/-1\u00b0C) while in transit, aims to address this challenge.

The efficacy of the current seasonal influenza vaccine typically ranges from 19% to 60%. We identified that the low efficacy is due to the phenomenon of subtype bias, which arises from limited CD4+ T cell 'help' across all strains. That is, even though the vaccine contains multiple strains, most individuals elicit a robust immune response to only one of the strains. This leaves individuals vulnerable to infection by other strains. Subtype bias occurs in approximately 65% of the vaccinated individuals which suggests that eliminating it may be a valid path to increase vaccine efficacy. Stanford scientists have discovered that coupling of antigens from multiple influenza strains can overcome subtype bias by increasing CD4+ T cell help, thereby inducing a robust immune response to all strains included in the formulation. The antibody response against multiple strains was higher with the coupled antigen formulation in comparison to the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine in a human organoid system, and a mouse model. Coupling of antigens can be a transformative method to eliminate subtype bias in multi-strain vaccine formulations needed against rapidly evolving pathogens, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2.

    "ip_description": "Creating human brain progenitors and neurons from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offers vast possibilities to study, model and treat neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, which are among the most intractable diseases that afflict our society. Despite successes in generating certain types of brain progenitors and neurons from hPSCs, generating a wide range of these cells for various brain regions has remained difficult. In particular, it has remained incredibly challenging to generate hindbrain cells. The hindbrain is a key region that constitutes the majority of the brainstem and is a life-sustaining region that controls breathing, eating, wakefulness, and sleep. The Loh Lab at Stanford has developed methods to rapidly create forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain progenitors from hPSCs (within several days), and additionally, multiple types of forebrain and hindbrain neurons (within two weeks). This is accomplished by treating hPSCs with different combinations of extracellular signals in defined, serum-free medium. While these hPSCs can differentiated into multiple brain regions, the inventors have accomplished the first human hindbrain motor neurons differentiation from hPSCs. Hindbrain motor neurons are destroyed by neuron degenerative diseases like spinal muscular atrophy. Therefore, the invention's newfound ability to create human hindbrain motor neurons and other types of neurons provides new opportunities for basic research, disease modeling, and regenerative therapies to replace missing or malfunctioning neurons in vivo. Applications: Cell therapy, Neurodegenerative diseases, Cellular techniques. Advantages: First and only known invention of a hindbrain cell therapy candidate, Enables study of hindbrain brain cells, such as neurons, which have never been accessible for this scale of research before, Method can be used to differentiate other neuron cells for all brain regions.",

    "ip_description": "Peripheral nerve injury is widespread, with U.S. estimates of over 200,000 cases per year and worldwide estimates as high as 1 million cases per year. Although in cases of minor injury, peripheral nerves can regenerate, for more severe injuries, direct microsurgical nerve repair is the preferred treatment. surgery often improves neurologic function in cases of severe peripheral nerve injury, but complete recovery of function is unfortunately quite rare. Surgical repair may fail to restore normal function as seen in approximately 40-60% of cases. There are currently no pharmacologic treatments available to patients that can accelerate nerve regeneration after injury and observation, direct surgical repair, or nerve graft repair. Given the high failure rate of complex nerve reconstruction, more effective methods of reconstruction are necessary.\n\nStanford researchers have found that a low dose of a small-molecule, systemic pathway agonist, SAG21k, improves nerve regeneration after injury and increases expression of injury-responsive genes within Schwann cells in the injured nerve. SAG21k is a potent hedgehog signaling pathway agonist that targets Smoothened, the key pathway effector protein. Administration is also feasible during surgery and may reduce the risk of systemic side effects.\n\nStage of Development\n_In vivo_ mouse models: researchers have found that the Smo agonist SAG21k improves nerve regeneration after injury in a mouse model.

Optimizing the differentiation and expansion of CD8 T cells can be a transformative method that increases the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapies. Synonymous single nucleotide variants (sSNVs), or silent mutations, are genetic variations that occur in protein-coding regions of the genome but do not change the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. While sSNVs were initially thought to be functionally neutral, they have recently been shown to effect gene expression, translation, and protein function. For example, the codon:anticodon specificity between a tRNA and an mRNA can affect the timing of translation and the co-translational folding of the protein. Despite their potential impact and prevalence, sSNVs are often overlooked in genome-wide association studies. Understanding the effects of sSNVs can gain insights into disease mechanisms and methods for optimizing precision medicine approaches. An sSNV that increases codon:anticodon affinity was found to be enriched in effector memory CD8 T cells (CD8 TEMs). Importantly, this sSNV was expanded specifically in CD8 TEMs with minimal enrichment in other cell types. Consequently, this establishes proof-of-concept that a more favorable codon can be utilized to facilitate increased and specific clonal expansion of CD8 T cells _in vivo_.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a method to suppress immune responses to RNA therapy by chemically treating the RNA with an acylating reagent. RNA therapy, which uses RNA-based molecules to modulate biological pathways, is a versatile and specific approach with the potential to treat a wide range of diseases. One of major hurdles to advancing RNA therapy is immunogenicity; injected or administered RNAs can be recognized by the immune system as foreign entities, triggering an innate immune response that might reduce the therapeutic efficacy and possibly cause side effects. There have been efforts to address this by modifying the structure or sequence of RNA nucleotides, suppressing the immune system, and packaging RNA within a shielding delivery system. Researchers at the Kool Lab in Stanford have identified a novel method to mitigate the immunogenicity problem. They used an acylating reagent to add acyl groups to the 2'-hydroxyl (OH) groups on RNAs. Lipofecting cells with the resulting polyacylated RNAs prevented recognition by toll-like receptors (TLRs) that typically trigger the immune response. Consequently, this led to a reduction in inflammatory responses without affecting translation. This approach is beneficial in that the RNA can be from any source and be of any length. Stage of Development: In vitro data in cultured cells. They are expanding the in vitro research to test in a wider range of cell types, including primary cells. Applications: mRNA vaccines, mRNA therapeutics, RNA interference, CRISPR therapies and diagnostics, siRNA, RNA aptamers, Anti-sense oligonucleotides.

Researchers in the Davis lab treated mice with these engineered TLR7-NPs and observed inhibition of tumor growth, prolonged survival, and effective immunological memory in colon, pancreatic, and glioma cancer models. Mice treated with TLR7-NPs and anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade therapy in combination exhibited even more robust antitumor efficacy, eliminating all tumors in a colon cancer model, and rejecting the second tumor challenge. This combination therapy also induces tumor regression and improves survival in a pancreatic cancer model. These results were recapitulated in a human skin tumor organoid where TLR7-NP and anti-PD-1 combination therapy induced a robust T cell response.

Vaccines made from inactivated viruses or protein subunits offer numerous advantages. However, with current aluminum-based adjuvants, these vaccines often require multiple doses or fail to elicit broad antibody responses against constantly mutating viruses such as seasonal influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2 virus. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists have shown promise as more potent adjuvants, but progress has been limited by toxic side effects. In response, the researchers have applied well-controlled chemistry to formulate an adjuvant from PEG-PLGA nanoparticles loaded with TLR7 agonist via an ester linkage. This chemistry allows for the programmed release profile of TLR7 agonist in the body - slow release in circulation and faster release in intracellular endosomes, promoting immune responses and reducing systemic serum cytokine expression.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a technique that can rapidly and sequentially separate multiple sets of III-V solar cell thin films grown as a stack on one III-V wafer. Their rapid laser liftoff wafer recovery technique may reduce cost and fabrication time by an order of magnitude. Currently, gallium arsenide (GaAs) single crystal growth substrates \u2013 used for the best performing solar cells \u2013 are expensive and difficult to grow (accounting for an estimated 1/3 of the cost of GaAs solar cells). Because the GaAs solar cells do not depend on the substrate for operation, it is desirable that the solar cell thin films be removed from the GaAs wafer and the wafer reused for multiple growths. The Stanford process, by effectively multiplying the number of cells that may be recovered per wafer reuse, can significantly increase throughput and reduce costs. Moreover, the process is not limited to solar cells and may be used to produce many III-V thin film devices.\n\nThe researchers report that their process achieves the same effect as multiplying the number of possible wafer recovery cycles by x, where x is the number of devices grown per growth process. In other words, if a wafer can be reused 10 times with the laser liftoff process, growing 5 devices per growth would be equivalent to reusing the wafer 50 times, therefore lowering the average substrate cost.\n\nApplications:\n- Single-crystal III-V optoelectronic thin film devices such as high-efficiency single- and multi-junction III-V solar cells, LEDs, and detectors (e.g., ejected detector arrays).\n\nAdvantages:\n- Leverages the unique benefits of laser liftoff relative to other wafer recovery techniques, e.g., the process takes minutes instead of hours and does not require long substrate acid exposure.\n- Allows for multiple devices from each substrate use.\n- Compared to laser liftoff of a single device, this process reduces the average energy consumed per device produced by utilizing only a single substrate heating and cooling cycle per set of x devices, thus reducing the time for energy payback.\n- Precludes poor surface quality issues. Sending the laser pulse through the device instead of the substrate eliminates the need to protect the optical quality of the substrate backside (i.e., lower surface) during thin film growths.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed practical applications that use germline information (e.g., germline epitope burden) for diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of cancer. Cancer represents a wide spectrum of molecularly and morphologically diverse diseases. Individuals with the same histopathological classification can have tumors with drastically different molecular profiles and clinical responses to treatment. Malignancy is defined by a set of abnormal biological capacities, termed the hallmarks of cancer, and decades of histopathologic and molecular profiling of human tumors have demonstrated that there are multiple ways cells can acquire each hallmark. As a result, the molecular profile of tumors with the same clinical characteristics can vary dramatically from individual to individual, and it is unclear when these molecular differences originate, all of which can impact treatment options. Finally, current prediction of relapse is generally only 1-5 years, and it is desirable to obtain more accuracy to determine proper treatment and when a pre-malignant tumor will become malignant. The inventors have developed methods to use (i) a tumor subtype (malignant or premalignant) of a subject, e.g. whether a particular cancer has an alteration in a particular region, and (ii) germline epitope burden for the particular region, e.g. amount of peptide epitopes generated from the germline of a subject, to determine the probability: (i) of a relapse of a particular tumor subtype, (ii) of immune response given a particular subtype, and (ii) that a pre-malignant lesion will become malignant. Applications include methods to investigate germline-mediated immunoediting, molecular modeling for improving cancer risk stratification, predicting relapse of a particular tumor subtype in a subject, predicting immune response of a particular cancer subtype in a subject, and predicting the risk of premalignant tissue becoming cancerous in a subject. Advantages include using a measurement of epitope subtype burden, along with tumor subtype, can increase accuracy of relapse prediction.

Using machine-learning to detect DMRs in blood-based tests could increase cancer screening uptake in high-risk adults and reduce lung-cancer-related mortality. Image-based screening of high-risk adults, such as individuals with a history of smoking, reduces lung-cancer-related mortality; however, uptake of screening has been relatively low. Only around 5% of eligible individuals undergo screening due to factors such as high costs, limited access, and concerns for false positives. Genomic blood tests for cancer screening could be an effective alternative to increase the total number of patients screened and the number of lives saved annually from lung-cancer-related mortality. But current methods suffer from low sensitivity or have focused on diseases other than lung cancer. Interestingly, aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to be associated with lung ctDNA, suggesting that the use of DMRs as a biomarker in blood-based lung cancer screening could increase its sensitivity and utility in early cancer detection. Including DNA methylation in a machine-learning enabled molecular method for lung cancer screening resulted in a positive correlation between DMR detection and the fraction of ctDNA in the sample. Importantly, the novel, blood-based method for early cancer detection has a 15% increase in sensitivity relative to the leading published method. Consequently, including DNA methylation in blood-based tests for early cancer detection has the potential to drastically improve screening sensitivity, increase cancer screening uptake in high-risk adults, and reduce lung-cancer-related mortality.

In proof-of-concept studies, they were exposed to polystyrene (PS), one of the most commonly used plastics and environmental pollutants. Plastic pollution is increasing at an alarming rate, yet the impact of this pollution on human health is poorly understood. Since skin is the most frequently used source for derivation of hiPSCs and in direct contact with pollutants, hiPSCs derived from dermal fibroblasts offer a powerful platform to start to identify molecular biomarkers of environmental pollution in human cells.\n\nAdult human dermal fibroblasts, used for their reprogramming and derivation of hiPSCs, were exposed to PS. The genetic and epigenetic profiles of both exposed fibroblasts and derived hiPSC were studied, revealing commonly altered genes, signaling circuits, and pathways involved in human diseases. Even when exposed to a low concentration of PS, hiPSCs demonstrated altered DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiles. This strategy for deriving new hiPSC lines can help define the impact of epigenetic memory/mechanisms and environmental pollution on human health, identifying specific cellular responses, and narrowing down the list of candidate biomarkers. The derived cell lines can thus help to decipher the origins of environment-related diseases and offer new therapeutic targets.\n\nThis strategy can also be applied to study or test new drugs, cosmetic products, chemicals, or any other exposure factor, not just environmental pollutants.

    "ip_description": "Stanford University researchers have developed aptamer-antibody chimeras that achieve dynamic, sensitive, and specific biomolecule sensing beyond the capacity of antibodies or aptamers alone. DNA aptamers are short sequences of engineered DNA that selectively bind to a target molecule and generate a reversible fluorescent or electrochemical signal in response, enabling continuous sensing in applications from diagnostics to environmental monitoring. However, aptamers are limited by poor sensitivity. Researchers therefore combined the signaling abilities of an aptamer with the high sensitivity and specificity of a monoclonal antibody by combining the two components with a short DNA linker. This new sensor can detect target molecules at very low concentrations (Kd = ~100 pM) even in complex samples, enabling rapid, direct detection in biofluids or environmental samples without expensive and time-consuming sample preparation. Sensors can track changes in target concentration over time with high temporal resolution (~10 minutes). Sensors are easy to engineer, as they can take advantage of existing antibodies and aptamers without any further engineering. Features like affinity, sensitivity, and temporal response can be rationally tuned by changing the length of the DNA linker or modifying the aptamer sequence. Applications include fluorescent or electrochemical signal output, wearable or implantable biosensors, point-of-care and at-home diagnostics, personalized medicine, and wastewater and agricultural monitoring. Advantages include sensitivity superior to traditional DNA aptamers (Kd = ~100 pM), no requirement for a secondary antibody, preparation-free, direct sensing in complex samples, continuous sensing of changes in target concentration over time, temporal resolution of ~10 minutes, and highly modular and tunable.",

The Optical Communications Group designed multimode erbium-doped fiber amplifier (MM-EDFA) for six spatial modes (12 spatial and polarization modes) includes a graded-index (GI) multimode fiber amplifier with optimized ring erbium doping profile, length, and pump mode powers.

Axonopathy is a common early feature of central nervous system (CNS) neurodegenerative diseases, including glaucoma and ALS, which is characterized by axon degeneration followed by progressive neuronal cell body death. The axons of adult CNS neurons do not regenerate spontaneously after degeneration, which causes irreversible neuronal function deficits. There are currently no neural repair therapies.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a new avenue for stimulating T effector and Treg immune cells in an antigen-specific manner. Commensal microbiota have been shown to functionally regulate the innate and adaptive immune systems and must establish distinct niches at barrier sites throughout the human body. To prevent aberrant immune responses to commensal microbiota, Treg cells participate in tissue-specific immune regulation at barrier sites where they typically reside. In contrast, T effector cells generally amplify pro-inflammatory responses in an antigen-specific manner. In another vein, autoimmune diseases are estimated to effect up to 1 in every 10 individuals. Expanding Treg populations in the setting of autoimmune diseases is highly desirable and has shown favorable results in several animal models. However, methods for expanding these specific cells in vivo in a safe and efficacious manner are still elusive. The inventors have pioneered a new approach to elicit and expand antigen-specific Tregs and T effector cells. Helicobacter hepaticus bacteria can be engineered to express a heterologous non-native protein or peptide. This peptide or protein could be of interest in an autoimmune disease or a specific cancer, among other things. Subsequently, dendritic cells will then phagocytose the bacteria, digest, and present the heterologous protein or peptide to na\u00efve T-cells. In parallel, Treg-inducing cytokines will be administered to induce differentiation of na\u00efve T-cells into Tregs. Once completed, this process will result in a Treg cell that has a TCR specific for a host antigen of interest. The inventors have also laid out a similar process for producing antigen-specific T effector cells. Applications include creating T effector cells that are antigen-specific for proteins or peptides selectively expressed on the cell surface of cancer cells and creating Tregs that are antigen-specific for proteins or peptides implicated in autoimmune diseases. Advantages include a customizable platform that is able to be modified to treat a number of diseases.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are essential for hearing as they transmit electrical signals from the cochlea to the brain. Loss of SGNs causes permanent hearing loss because SGNs do not spontaneously regenerate in humans. Despite their scientific and clinical importance, the developmental, cellular, and molecular features of human SGNs remain poorly characterized due to the limited accessibility to the human inner ear and incomplete phenotypic conversion of stem cells into SGN-like cells in vitro. Unfortunately, a fundamental obstacle in the study of human SGNs is the inability to obtain routine tissue biopsies due to the small size of the cochlea, its complex three-dimensional anatomy, and encasement in dense bone. To overcome this challenge, inventors at Stanford have developed a novel method for generating human spiral ganglion neurons using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to generate functional SGNs via otic neurosensory progenitor cells (ONPs) in vitro. Utilizing the method enables the mimicking of in vivo cell-to-cell signaling occurring during human inner ear development. This is the first comprehensive description of the heterogeneity of human auditory neuronal populations using high-resolution transcriptomic profiling of individual cells, coupled with electrophysiological characterization of the cells' functional diversification. These human neurons offer powerful cellular models to decipher the precise mechanisms underlying hearing disorders and to enable future targeted therapies. The invention offers a novel platform to answer fundamental questions in auditory research and facilitate therapeutic innovation for sensorineural hearing loss. The high-efficiency, monolayer SGN culture protocol could be a reliable source of cells for drug screening. Unlike 3D organoids, the invented method results in 2D cultures that are representative of their in vivo counterparts and provide benefits for easier scale-up, monitoring, functional tests, and quality control in a realistic way, as has already been demonstrated using dissociated mouse SGNs. Finally, this protocol could be used to test potentially regenerative, patient-specific therapies aimed at replacing or repairing human SGNs. Applications: - Therapeutic innovation for sensorineural hearing loss - Understanding of the normal, as well as abnormal, development of the human auditory system - Understanding inherited disorders leading to hearing loss. - Drug screening - 2D in vivo cultures for easier scale-up, monitoring, functional tests, and quality control - Regenerative, patient-specific therapies aimed at replacing or repairing human SGNs Advantages: - Novel platform to answer fundamental questions in auditory research and facilitate therapeutic innovation for sensorineural hearing loss - 2D cultures for easier scale-up, monitoring, functional tests, and quality control of high-throughput drug screening - First comprehensive description of the heterogeneity of human auditory neuronal populations using high-resolution transcriptomic profiling of individual cells, coupled with electrophysiological characterization of the cells' functional diversification.",

This invention can non-invasively concentrate ultrasound waves onto peripheral nerves without impacting surrounding tissue. It uses focused ultrasound waves to block pain fibers for 1-2 weeks with minimal motor fiber blockage, avoiding problems with common pharmaceutical painkillers and traditional 'nerve block' techniques.\n\nPain after surgery or injury is often moderate-to-severe for 1-2 weeks and the majority of patients have poorly controlled acute pain during this time. Moderate-to-severe acute pain is associated with increased risk of a wide array of worsened health outcomes including developing myocardial ischemia, impaired pulmonary function, ileus, thromboembolism, impaired immune function, infection, and anxiety. Opioids are commonly prescribed to treat pain and they do well at controlling dull, burning, or rest pain, but don't do as well at controlling sharp or movement pain. Traditional 'nerve blocks' use inject local anesthetics near nerves; these local anesthetic drugs block all nerve fibers, not just pain fibers, including motor and non-pain sensory fibers, which can increase the risk of a patient falling and prevents early participation in physical therapy. There is therefore a significant need for a non-invasive, non-drug based pain therapy which can block acute pain for 1-2 weeks after surgery or injury without the risk of major side effects.

Although promising, CAR T cell therapy efficacy in solid tumors is limited by hostile tumor microenvironments, limited CAR T persistence, and lack of tumor killing. Extracellular adenosine contributes to the hostile tumor microenvironment by binding the adenosine A2a receptor on immune cells. Blocking A2aR or enhancing ADA-mediated adenosine metabolism to inosine protects T cells from adenosine-mediated immunosuppression. Stanford scientists showed that human CAR T cells are also susceptible to adenosine-mediated immunosuppression. They developed an approach where they overexpressed ADA in exhausted and non-exhausted CAR T cells leading to a higher frequency of stem cell-like memory T cell effectors, and a simultaneous decrease of exhausted subpopulations.

Organoids represent a major step forward in in vitro research studies into a myriad of disease states. 3D organoid models possess key advantages over conventional 2D cell culture models including a closer approximation of in vivo settings as well as a reduction of genomic background signal which in turn enables editing with CRISPR/Cas9 technology to further reproduce disease states. Current organoid construction involves resuspending aggregated cells in commercially available extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics, rather than from a single cell. Due to this property of their construction, it is difficult to determine whether an organoid phenotype has arisen from the stochasticity of the deposited cell population, or from an intrinsic property of individual cells. Single organoid phenotypic characterization remains a challenge. The inventors have identified a new microwell based technique for the high-throughput quantification of image-based parameters at single organoid resolution. This method can be used to phenotypically monitor thousands of organoids in parallel. Phenotypes such as organoid growth rates, migration behavior, and fluorescently labeled protein expression and localization are all parameters that can be assessed through this pipeline. Once profiled, organoids can be retrieved from their microwells for sequencing and molecular profiling to determine the genomic or proteomic origin of the organoid's phenotypic state. Applications include high-throughput drug screening of patient-derived human organoids, characterization of genetic mutations of interest in parallel, and elucidation of genetic mutations that contribute to tumor microenvironments.

Protein-protein interactions are one of the most fundamental biological processes which biomedical science has sought to engineer. Many currently available medications selectively modulate one binding partner of a protein of interest for therapeutic benefit. Therefore, it is advantageous to be able to screen protein-protein interactions in an unbiased and high-throughput manner. Multiplexed microbead assays allow for massively multiplexed high throughput evaluation of a myriad of biological proteomic interactions. However, these assays often have a limited possible coding space with fluorescently encoded beads. The inventors have developed a method of screening that modulates protein-protein interactions. Specifically, a library of microfluidically-produced hydrogel beads encoded with radiometric combinations of lanthanide nanophosphors (MRBLES) are produced. Subsequently, a library of bead-bound peptides with bind site sequences are synthesized on the surface of those MRBLES. The MRBLES have embedded with lanthanide spectral codes that correspond to the binding site sequences.

Binding interactions in each well of an array are quantified via a detectable label (e.g. an antibody with an attached fluorophore). This then gives a read out of the binding interactions between many binding site peptides and a protein of interest in parallel in the presence and absence of a modulating factor.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have synthesized a potential novel class of pain relief drugs. Traditional opioids, while highly effective for acute pain management, have historically been prescribed as long-term analgesic treatments despite their well-known addictive properties. Fully synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are even more potent than traditional opioids and have further fueled the opioid epidemic. Both synthetic and traditional opioids act as agonists against the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). Considering the far-reaching socioeconomic impacts of the opioid epidemic, new pain relief therapeutics are needed to quell further morbidity and mortality. In another vein, it has been shown that cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) are essential components of pain modulation. The inventors have discovered and characterized novel modulators of MOR and CB1. These compounds have the potential to act on the same biological systems as opioids with potentially reduced addictive properties. Additionally, these compounds have potential roles in treating opioid overdose. Some compounds disclosed in this patent are positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and some are negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of MOR. Rather than acting as direct agonists and binding to the binding site of these receptors, they bind at alternative locations on the protein to effect function. This provides a distinct benefit of these compounds over traditional or synthetic opioids in that molecules that bind at allosteric sites can signal more specifically through the MOR or CB1 to avoid off-target effects, including potential psychoactive effects. Applications include novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of acute and chronic pain and development of non-addictive medications for pain relief. Advantages include potentially less psychoactive or addictive effects when compared to currently available opioid medication and more specifically targeting receptors involved in pain modulation, reducing off-target effects.",

Congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) is a genetic disorder of pancreas and beta-cell function characterized by the failure to suppress insulin secretion in the setting of hypoglycemia, resulting in severe hypoglycemia that can cause brain damage or death if inadequately treated. Roughly 50% of HI patients can manage their condition with the existing drugs diazoxide or octreotide, but the other 50% must undergo a pancreatectomy, leading to long-term surgical complications.

This technology involves a gold cluster-based nanocomplex serving as both the radiosensitizer and a gene vector carrying siRNA, specifically targeting the tumor marker protein Galectin-1. Cancer treatments often face the daunting obstacle of radio-resistance and immunosuppression, hindering the effectiveness of conventional therapies. Additionally, distant metastasis remains a critical concern, impacting long-term patient survival rates. This technology is designed to autonomously accumulate within tumor and metastatic niches, delivering its siRNA payload to knock down the radio-resistant Galectin-1 protein. Simultaneously, the gold atoms within the nano-complex generate cell-killing reactive oxygen species upon radiation treatment, promoting efficient tumor elimination. To further boost the systemic immune response, the gold nano-complex facilitates enhanced stereotactic body radiotherapy, leading to increased immunogenic cell death. Additionally, the clearance of immunosuppressive Galectin-1 supports long-term immune surveillance, preventing distant metastasis and improving overall survival rates.

The new strategy enables incorporation of biologics (e.g., biomolecules, drugs or cells) through a uniform thick hydrogel layer onto porous scaffolds while retaining interconnected open pores, or onto non-porous implants. Existing coating techniques, including layer-by-layer coating and adhesive coating, have been used to load biomolecules on the surface of porous implants. However, these techniques restrict loading to a limited amount of biomolecules. Loading a large or tunable dose of biomolecules on implants is particularly important since the effective dose of biomolecules is often high in vivo and could be different for various indications. For the HyTEC proof of concept, the researchers loaded model proteins and cells on 3D printed biodegradable polycaprolactone and ?-tricalcium phosphate (PCL-TCP) as a model polymer-ceramic porous scaffold, a PCL-TCP rod as a model polymer-ceramic non-porous implant, and stainless steel needles as a model metal.\n\nApplications:\n- HyTEC is used for delivery of therapeutics including cells and/or biomolecules along with a structural support for applications in regenerative medicine.

    "ip_description": "Mature pancreatic islets are the gold standard for transplantation-based approaches for islet replacement in type 1 and type 3c diabetes mellitus (T1D and T3cD), but this feature is offset by the scarcity of human cadaveric pancreas donors. Thus, global efforts are directed to develop replacement islets from renewable sources like human stem cell lines. Despite progress in this area, stem cell-derived replacement islets (SCRIs) lack functional maturation, and recent work has identified molecular, signaling and genetic features of this incomplete development. This includes evidence for GPCR-based signaling between islet cells during fetal development, and expression of crucial factors like the transcriptional regulators in normal human islet beta cell maturation. Islet development in humans and other vertebrates involves aggregation of individual islet cells into multicellular islets to produce heterogeneous clusters of beta, alpha, and delta cells, and other non-islet cell types. Thus, from their birth, interactions between islet cells likely guide islet development. However, the mechanisms of intra-islet signaling to foster human islet development and maturation remain poorly characterized. To address this knowledge gap, inventors at Stanford have exploited the use of pseudoislets to mix SCRI cells and native human islet cells to create mixed chimeras. By using molecular and electrophysiological assays, they showed that exposure of SCRI beta cells to native islet cells in such in vitro cell mixtures substantially enhances their molecular and functional maturation. The invention disperses cells from stem-cell-derived protocols, and mixes these with dispersed bona fide islet cells from adult donors (human or pig). They are then cultured briefly before being re-isolated into the stem cell-derived progeny resembling islet beta-cells. When re-isolated, these show improved features including production of maturity markers and improved function. These pseudoislets have been demonstrated to function and be transplantable in diabetic animals. The invention identifies a process to provide crucial signals for islet maturation and can be applied for development of replacement islet beta cells or other islet cell types. Applications: Stem cell-derived replacement islets for diabetes, Renewable human beta cells. Advantages: Retains key features of native human beta cells, including SIX2 and SIX3 production that stimulate beta function and specialization, Improved features including production of maturity markers and improved function, Biocompatible and transplantable in vivo.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed new lentiviral vectors that are able to deliver more genetic information than currently available vectors, aiding in the development of gene therapy. Gene therapy is one of the most promising therapeutic avenues in translational medicine. This method involves the genetic engineering of cells in living humans to replace dysfunctional or pathogenic versions of genes. Several methods have been proposed for delivering gene therapy in patients, one of which is lentiviral vectors (LVVs). Lentiviruses are a group of retroviruses that can insert parts of their genetic material into a host cell's genome, including non-dividing cells. While LVVs have many advantages for use in gene therapy, one caveat of this approach is the limited capacity of these vectors. LVVs have approximately an 8-12 kilobase (kb) payload, which limits their delivery capacity to 1-2 genes. This physical limitation attenuates LVVs effectiveness in clinical gene therapy settings in which a larger payload capacity is needed to resolve genetic mutations. The inventors have devised a strategy to produce LVVs with roughly double the payload capacity of those currently available. Wild-type LVVs have two identical or nearly identical gRNAs. However, the full capacity of these gRNAs was not able to be utilized due to dimerization interactions between the two gRNAs that result in dimer linkage structure that is integral to viral packaging. The inventors have designed LVV structures that allow for the combining of the two gRNAs such that interactions between like-gRNAs that would form homodimers are thermodynamically favored and stabilized, while interactions between unlike gRNAs that would form heterodimers are not thermodynamically favored and stabilized. Thus, these LVVs can form dimer linkage structures needed for viral packaging (homodimers) while avoiding heterodimers that would disrupt distinct sequences meant to be delivered as a payload into the genomes of human cells. Applications include use of increased-capacity LVVs for gene therapy in vivo and use of increased-capacity LVVs as research tools. Advantages include roughly double the payload capacity of LVVs used under current methods and increased payload capacity makes these LVVs for broad use in a myriad of biomedical applications that require more than 1-2 genes to be modified.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a new microparticle vaccine scaffold for the development of immunogenic subunit vaccines. Vaccines are one of the most important biomedical advances of the 20th century. Protein vaccines, often referred to as subunit vaccines, have proved to be a particularly useful vaccine strategy. Subunit vaccines have been licensed for the prevention of infectious diseases such as HPV, hepatitis B, and influenza. To assist immunogenicity, subunit vaccines are often administered with adjuvants, carrier proteins or nanoparticles. While these co-administered factors often help with immunogenicity, they often create problems for the scalability of these vaccines. The inventors have developed a new scaffolding method for eliciting immunogenicity in subunit vaccines. Specifically, the inventors devised strategies for the purification and conjugation of peptidoglycan (PGN) microparticles from several bacterial strains. PGN is easily purifiable, naturally immunogenic, and readily biodegradable, making it an ideal candidate as a vaccine scaffold. This system uses optimized Staphylococcus aureus PGN microparticles containing azido-D-alanine which is highly manipulatable and creates strong conjugations to immunogens of interest. Furthermore, these PGN microparticles conjugated to protein subunits yielded immunogenic responses similar to those of conventional carrier proteins such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). When PGN microparticles were conjugated to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV2, this subunit vaccine was shown to produce comparable neutralizing antibody titers to those produced by KLH-conjugated RBD, demonstrating the effectiveness of this novel vaccine scaffold. Applications: Novel protein scaffold for subunit vaccines. Advantages: PGN is readily biodegradable while maintaining robust immunogenicity.

To combat this issue, Stanford researchers have developed chemically modified AAV vectors which display an unnatural amino acid on the capsid surface.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a wearable patch that allows for continuous mental health monitoring via electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. EEG technology was developed during the advent of neuroscience nearly a century and a half ago. EEG technology works by recording and analyzing surface electrical signals on more than a dozen sites on the human head. These signals correspond to electrical impulses sent by groups of neurons in the cortex, which is the outermost layer of the brain. In the modern day, EEG is used to diagnose many neurological conditions including epilepsy, sleep disorders, and other psychiatric conditions. While very useful in medical practice, EEG technology has drawbacks, including the use of heavy or bulky wires to deploy multiple electrodes. This caveat makes the use of EEG for long-term neurological monitoring impractical using currently available technology due to discomfort caused by bulky equipment. The inventors have developed a lightweight, wearable patch that can record EEG signals. This patch contains one or more electrodes that record electrical signals produced by neurons in the cortex. The patch also contains an analog digital converter (ADC) to record the signals picked up by the electrodes. Subsequently, the ADC then passes along these signals to a digital controller which is configured to encode EEG data into a single-bit series so it can be transmitted effectively. Finally, the patch then transmits signals through a radio frequency (RF) transmitter to an external receiver where they can be analyzed. Applications include long-term monitoring of numerous neurological and mental health conditions by EEG, and enabling further research into recordable electrical patterns detectable by EEG that may provide additional diagnostic methods for neurological or mental health conditions. Advantages include being lightweight, weighing only a single gram as well as relatively small (approximately the size of a penny), and the patch format allows this technology to be wearable, which in turn allows long-term monitoring with little quality of life disruption to patients as compared to currently available technology which is bulky and requires wires.",

    "ip_description": "Amyloid ? (A?) is a key protein involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A key property of A? that is now believed to be at the core of its toxicity in AD is its ability to form soluble, toxic oligomers. Targeting such oligomers remains a promising avenue for AD therapeutic development. It has been found that 1:1 equimolar LL-37/A?40 mixtures are totally prevented from forming A? fibrils, while lower relative molar amounts of LL-37 slow the kinetics of fibril formation; and in this patent, a synthetic peptoid mimic of LL-37 is also shown to bind A?. It has also become clear that sporadic AD (not resulting from a unique familial predisposition to disease) is either caused by or accompanied by the occurrence of polymicrobial brain infections and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Certain oral pathogens that are associated with dementia\u2014including Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG), Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) and Candida albicans\u2014can be killed or inactivated by the LL-37 peptide, which is produced by the human innate immune system, as well as by peptoid mimics of LL-37 described in this patent. Although A?:LL-37 interactions offer an interesting starting point in the development of new therapeutic approaches that block A? aggregation and toxicity, the relatively complex, poorly understood, pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects of LL-37, as well as its relatively high molecular weight (~4500 g/mol, 37 amino acids) and extreme vulnerability to cleavage by proteases, are substantially disadvantageous features from the standpoint of using the peptide as an exogenous AD therapeutic. Thus, a biostable peptoid mimic of LL-37 is more promising. It was recently discovered that certain peptoid mimics of LL-37 share the same anti-amyloid activity of the peptide, while also exhibiting potent antimicrobial and antiviral activity against both P. gingivalis, HSV-1, and C. albicans. Thus, these peptoids have the potential to be developed as antimicrobial treatments that may also serve as anti-amyloid treatments.",

However, the manufacturing techniques remain time-intensive and low-throughput for large-scale production of TCOs via traditional vacuum-based deposition (i.e., sputtering). The scientists at Stanford developed a novel open-air and scalable TCO synthesis technique that is time-efficient, highly tunable, and environmentally friendly. The chloride-free combustion synthesis uses an open-air ultrasonic spray or other solution casting technique to deposit the coating, and then anneals rapidly to generate an amorphous or crystalline oxide depending on the curing temperature. Then, an open-air plasma is used to tune the film conductivity. This method gives high throughput, requires low temperature deposition for amorphous oxide generation, and simultaneously achieves high conductivity.

Scintillators, used in PET imaging, are materials that convert high-energy radiation into low-energy photons in the UV-Vis region. An ultrafast scintillator can largely improve the coincidence timing window (CTR) and allow for better signal localization. Current state-of-the-art scintillators have decay constants of 200ns-1000ns.

Inventors also developed a novel nanoparticle self-assembly fabrication method in which scintillating nanoparticles can be 3D printed in lieu of expensive monocrystal growth and labor-intensive physical fabrication methods to create metamaterial scintillating detectors.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have developed a new approach for proximity labeling via optogenetic control. Allosteric regulation is common in naturally occurring enzymes in living tissues. However, despite its ability to improve spatial and temporal control, allostery has yet to be used extensively in artificially engineered enzymes. One artificially engineered enzyme, TurboID, achieves broad proximity-dependent biotinylation. While Turbo is useful for mapping interactomes and organelle proteomes both in vivo and in vitro, one important drawback is that Turbo's substrate, biotin, is endogenously expressed in most tissues of living organisms. This endogenous expression severely limits its temporal specificity. Furthermore, poor genetic integration and targeting can additionally contribute to the limited spatial specificity of Turbo and other proximity labeling enzymes. This limitation can be highly dependent on cell type, cellular compartment, and proteins of interest. Further methods are needed to improve the spatial specificity of proximity labeling via Turbo. The inventors have developed a light-regulated version of Turbo, dubbed LOV-Turbo. This enzyme was engineered through a combination of structure-guided design, screening and directed evolution to express a light-dependent domain. LOV-Turbo has virtually undetectable activity in darkness but activates within seconds of weak blue light illumination. Additionally, LOV-Turbo has an extremely wide dynamic range even in the presence of high amounts of biotin. The inventors have proven in a peer-reviewed study that this enzyme can efficiently and accurately perform proximity labeling in yeast, bacteria, and the mouse brain. This is especially impressive considering that neurons have a relatively high burden of biotin and are therefore more prone to confounding background noise in the original TurboID system. The applications of LOV-Turbo are vast, exciting, and represent a step forward in the field of enzyme engineering. Applications include enhanced spatial and temporal specificity when compared to other proximity-labeling enzymes, the ability to perform pulse-chase experiments to explore protein shuttling between different cellular compartments, and activation by the luciferase NanoLuc via BRET to selectively biotinylate protein subcomplexes. Advantages include comparable activity to the original TurboID enzyme, increased temporal and spatial specificity when compared to other proximity labeling enzymes, and additional avenues for the interrogation of cellular and molecular biology.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed an innovation that will enhance the depth of the imaging capabilities for optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Optical coherence tomography is a technique for visualizing various medias that was originally developed in the 1990s for the imaging of ocular measurements. This technique is of clinical significance due to its ability to image tissue morphology at a much higher resolution than other clinical imaging techniques such as MRI. OCT provides what are effectively 'optical ultrasound' images by directing an optical beam at a tissue of interest. A fraction of this light will then be reflected from sub-surface features of the tissue and subsequently recorded to create a digital reconstruction of the sub-surface tissue morphology. The key advantage of this technique is its high resolution and lack of ionizing radiation due to its use of light as a reflective source rather than sound or radio frequency. Despite advancements in the field of OCT imaging, improved methods to extend the depth of focus in these systems represents a major unmet medical need. The inventors have developed new methods of creating needle-shaped beams to extend the depth of focus in OCT imaging systems. Briefly, a diffractive optical element with a predetermined phase profile is used to create a single beam with multiple foci along the axial direction of propagation. This then produces a beam that has both a large depth of focus and a narrow diameter. This needle shaped beam can then be used in a myriad of optical imaging and analysis systems. While other OCT systems utilize multiple beams, they fail to achieve the same extended depth that the inventor's system does without considerable draw backs. The inventor's system provides the capability to extend the depth of focus of imaging in an OCT system while maintaining lateral resolution along the depth of the image, allowing for an increased depth of focus without sacrificing a wide field of view. Applications include increased depth of focus imaging for clinical applications such as ocular imaging and increased depth of focus imaging for preclinical applications such as improved depth of imaging in animal models that require non-invasive imaging techniques. Advantages include maintaining OCT systems' non-invasive imaging method and extending the depth of focus of current OCT systems without sacrificing on lateral field of view.",

Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. Patient mortality rates have been decreasing due to earlier detection methods and screening of genetic biomarkers associated with at-risk populations. However, targeted therapeutic strategies have not advanced to an equal extent, in particular against patients diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a particularly aggressive and invasive cancer subtype and the only therapeutic intervention available to these patients is chemotherapy, which is known to be non-specific, highly toxic, and therefore limited. In addition, patients diagnosed with TNBC often experience worse survival outcomes than patients with other types of breast cancer. Cyclin-dependent kinase 19 (CDK19) and a related isoform CDK8 are oncogenic transcription-related kinases that play a role in certain cancers, including TNBC. Compounds that non-selectively inhibit CDK19 and CDK8 have been explored for their anti-cancer properties but have shown to have undesirable side effects due to the CDK8 inhibition, which is more widely-distributed in tissues than CDK19. Therefore, there remains a need for compounds which selectively inhibit CDK19 over CDK8, as well as new methods of treating cancers such as TNBC that comprise administering such compounds. The inventors have developed compounds that are inhibitors of CDK19. Inhibition of CDK19 has been shown to be effective against breast cancer, including TNBC.

Myriad advances in the field of infectious diseases have been made in the last century, including the development of antibiotics and the widespread use of vaccines. While vaccines offer a powerful tool for prophylaxis against viral (and some bacterial) infections, there is a dearth of treatments available to those who are already infected with a specific virus. Anti-retroviral therapy is a notable exception to this rule, with anti-polymerase and anti-proteinase pharmaceuticals comprising an incredibly effective strategy in controlling viral replication of HIV. However, these treatments remain costly and unavailable to most people worldwide despite nearly 40 years on the market. Additional therapeutic strategies are needed to adequately address RNA viral infections worldwide. The inventors discovered that circular RNAs (cRNAs) that are encoded in RNA viral genomes can have pro-viral effects. In this vein, they have developed methods to inhibit cRNAs that have been identified as pro-viral and can therefore hamper viral replication in human cells. These methods include siRNA or shRNAs that target the cRNAs, an RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas system, or a small molecule. These methods can be used in both infected and bystander cells. Furthermore, the inventors also discovered specific cRNAs that act on host proteins to dampen the innate immune response in cells, therefore allowing excess viral replication. In turn, the inventors provide additional methods of viral replication impediment in the form of inhibiting these cRNAs that inhibit the innate immune response in cells, and therefore allows the host's own immune system to respond more effectively to a viral infection. Applications include treatment of RNA virus infections by limiting replication of the virus and/or promoting greater effectiveness of the hosts immune system to eliminate the virus.

Liquid biopsies that measure cfRNA afford broad clinical utility as these transcripts can reflect the health status of multiple tissue types.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at CZ Biohub SF and Stanford have developed unique fusion proteins that have broad therapeutic benefits for the treatment of infection by existing and future coronaviruses. Coronaviruses cause human illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. They are large, enveloped, and covered in surface 'Spike' glycoproteins that interact with host cell receptors to mediate host cell entry. To date, there are a limited number of active pharmaceutical agents that have any clinical effect in treating coronavirus-infected patients. COVID-19 therapeutics are limited to small molecules alone or in combination with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and with the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that have been identified, only one clinically available mAb retained activity suitable for use against the Omicron variant. Omicron has a larger mutational profile than previous variants of concern, thereby treatment of Omicron infections and subsequent novel future strains will require the development of broad-spectrum therapeutic agents. The inventors have developed fusion proteins and modified proteins comprising a neutralizing polypeptide and an antibody (e.g., a non-neutralizing antibody) that binds to an epitope in a conserved region of one or more coronavirus spike proteins. The fusion proteins and modified proteins can specifically bind to and neutralize a broad spectrum of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and all known SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). Applications: The fusion proteins described herein demonstrate neutralizing activity against all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) tested, including Omicron and BA.2. Bi-functional fusion proteins containing two non-neutralizing antibodies with non-overlapping epitopes demonstrate sub-nano molar neutralization against all VOCs tested. Enabling the development of broad-spectrum therapeutic agents against future SARS-CoV-2 strains. Advantages: The fusion proteins described herein are highly cross-reactive compounds that compose a new class of broad-spectrum anti-viral agents.",

    "ip_description": "Opioid use disorders are responsible for a huge number of deaths in the US and abroad. Treatments like methadone offer a path to recovery for heroin addiction, but are burdened with high relapse rates, strict governmental oversight, and continued abuse potential, highlighting the need for non-opioid alternatives. Cannabis derivatives offer a possible treatment for opioid dependence. Rodent studies from Stanford's Shamloo and Barron laboratories suggest that the CB2 cannabinoid receptor is a meditator of the anti-addictive properties of cannabis derivatives. Selective targeting of the CB2 receptor- while avoiding the psychoactive effects of the CB1 receptor- can therefore be a viable strategy for the treatment of opioid use disorder. The inventors have designed a library of agonists for the CB2 receptor that maximize selectivity without activating CB1. As a result, the compounds minimize the psychoactive effects of cannabinoid use, while maximizing the mitigation of addiction behaviors. Beyond opioid use dependence, the compound library also has applications in pain relief and management, inflammatory disorders, and neuroinflammation. Applications: Treatment for opioid use dependence, pain management, inflammatory diseases, stroke, neuroinflammation, and animal models of opioid addiction. Advantages: Non-opioid option for addiction treatment, avoids psychoactive effects of cannabis derivatives, non-addictive option for pain relief.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Immune checkpoint blockade, a class of immunotherapy treatment which works by blocking inhibitory receptors on T cells to improve immune responses, has proven to be a remarkable clinical advance in the treatment of many diseases, particularly in cancer. However, most patients do not benefit from checkpoint blockade, and many of those who do eventually experience progression of disease. While the use of immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized cancer treatment, there is a need for greater mechanistic understanding of how checkpoint blockade works in patients. Recent studies have suggested that the success of immune checkpoint blockade may be related to the expansion of a population of T cells known as progenitor exhausted T cells. This population of progenitor exhausted T cells is known to express the inhibitory receptor PD-1 and the transcription factor TCF1. However, TCF1 is not expressed on the cell surface, making it difficult to target. Furthermore, there is no validated way to target these progenitor exhausted T cells in humans, as most studies have been performed in mice. Thus, there is an unmet need for more markers that can specifically identify progenitor exhausted T cells in humans. Doing so could enable the selective targeting and activation of the exhausted T cell population, potentially leading to improved patient responses to immune checkpoint blockade. Inventors at Stanford have profiled the T cell compartment of patients with lung cancer using single-cell-paired RNA and T cell receptor sequencing methods at high depth and regional resolution. They have identified a population of progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells in the lymph node of patients that are clonally linked to terminally exhausted T cells in the tumor. Additionally, by performing antigen specificity assays, the inventors found that this progenitor exhausted T cell population comprises a subset of tumor antigen-specific T cells, suggesting they are involved in the tumor response. Computational analysis identified several genes that preferentially mark these lymph node progenitor exhausted T cells, including CCL5, CMC1, EOMES, IL32, SIRPG, RARRES3, CST7, GZMM, and PDIA3. This invention can enable methods that can specifically target progenitor exhausted T cells in humans to modulate this population for clinical benefit. Applications: Immunology research, Selective targeting and activation of progenitor T cell population during immune checkpoint blockade treatment, Immunotherapy. Advantages: There is currently no clinical standard for targeting these progenitor exhausted T cells in humans.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have created ligand-induced dimerization activating RNA editing (LIDAR), a versatile molecular sensor that turns the presence of a ligand into translation of an output protein. Despite success in the development of synthetic receptors, most are not compatible with currently available therapeutic application systems, or the systems are difficult to use and their requirements impede many in vivo applications. The LIDAR system consists of three core components: an mRNA and two fusion proteins that dimerize upon the presence of a ligand. The first fusion protein enables strong and specific binding to the mRNA. The other fusion protein contains a catalytic domain that is placed in close proximity to the mRNA, enabling editing of the mRNA and allowing translation of an output (protein) coding sequence on the mRNA.\n\nThere are three classes of LIDAR sensors with the same core mechanism of activation: cLIDAR with a cytosolic ligand, eLIDAR with an extracellular ligand but intracellular components, and tLIDAR with an extracellular ligand whose detection is mediated by a natural receptor, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) or receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). LIDAR can detect most extracellular ligands that have a natural receptor including small molecules, peptides, and proteins. The input could also be synthetic, allowing for detection of most proteins that can be bound by antibodies, natural binding domains, or small molecules that can trigger dimerization of a protein pair. LIDAR is also capable of sensing intangible external stimuli, such as light or magnet fields. Multiple inputs could also be detected at the same time with multiple distinct outputs or conditional outputs. LIDAR can further directly interface with RADAR technology to detect both an mRNA of interest and a protein of interest. The output could be any protein that is able to be encoded on a single mRNA transcript.\n\nApplications:\n- Can be integrated into natural signaling cascades or synthetic circuits for precise tuning of complex cellular functions\n- Can enable detection of both cell type (as defined by mRNAs in the cell) and the surrounding state (as defined by proteins, peptides, or small molecules inside or outside the cell)\n- Could be applied as the basis of next-generation cell therapies such as CAR-T\n- Could be applied in cell engineering applications, allowing for markerless selection of cells for purification or to screen for increased protein production\n\nAdvantages:\n- Leverages RNA editing to exert function, a feature that no existing synthetic receptors possess\n- Can incorporate signals from an expanded set of inputs not accessible with current technologies\n- Can be delivered wholly by RNA, which broadens potential delivery strategies and enables in vivo delivery\n- Response time would be much faster than synthetic receptors that rely on transcription factors\n- Can be built upon completely humanized components, which is much safer and more compatible with in vivo applications\n- Can be built upon a variety of receptor architectures (cLIDAR, eLIDAR and tLIDAR)",

Although it is known that epicardial cells on the surface of the heart give rise to coronary artery smooth muscle deep in the myocardium, the differentiation steps between the epicardium and mature smooth muscle were previously unknown. Inventors at Stanford discovered that pericytes, mural cells closely associated with small blood vessels, are epicardial-derived progenitors for coronary artery smooth muscle. Pericytes is a new potential cell type for cell therapy that could be used for vascular regeneration, revascularization after an infarct, or vascular malformation.\n\nThe Red-Horse Lab have developed a method of providing smooth muscle cells to a tissue where they are needed. The invention involves creating an isolated population of epicardial-derived pericytes and providing the pericytes to the tissue of interest. The epicardial-derived pericytes then differentiate into smooth muscle cells that express smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. The pericytes are lineage committed but not as matured as smooth muscle cells, making them the ideal cell type to inject and induce angiogenesis within new tissues. This invented method also paves the way for pericytes to act as a drug target for vascular abnormalities in particular diseases which involve deregulated smooth muscle or deregulated pericytes.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   -Drug target for vascular diseases involving abnormal pericyte/smooth muscle deregulation.\n*   -Cell therapy applications where injected pericytes could induce angiogenesis in devascularized regions of all tissues in the body or replace lost smooth muscle on diseased vessels.\n*   -Smooth muscle angiogenesis\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   -lineage traced the intermediate step of pericytes differentiating into smooth muscle cells and obtained evidence for this differentiation pathway using 2 transgenic mouse models\n*   -Pericytes are lineage committed but not as matured as smooth muscle cells, making them the ideal cell type to inject and induce angiogenesis within new tissues",

Excess body weight is a primary underlying risk factor for a variety of human diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and several types of cancer. Although a variety of dietary and pharmacological interventions have emerged in the past several decades to combat obesity, therapeutics capable of safely promoting significant and sustained weight loss are still needed. Leptin is a hormone that plays a critical role in regulating energy balance and body weight. When functioning properly, leptin suppresses hunger and increases energy expenditure, helping to maintain a stable body weight. Previous attempts to use leptin as a drug have been disappointing in part due to Leptin resistance and high serum leptin levels in obese patients also present an obstacles to the efficacy of wild-type-leptin-based drugs. This invention describes engineered leptin variants that function as high affinity biased agonists, thereby decoupling activation of the anorexigenic LepR-STAT3 pathway from pathways associated with leptin resistance. Together with additional modifications that enhance the solubility and stability of these variants, these leptin analogs could overcome the challenges of the native Leptin protein and lead to novel pharmacological outcomes that help overcome leptin resistance.

    "ip_description": "The maintenance of lean muscle mass is fundamental for healthy metabolism and healthy aging. Lower muscle mass across large human cohorts has been strongly associated with higher incidence of obesity, worsened diabetes and metabolic disease, frailty in the elderly, and even increased mortality. A class of peptide ligands that regulate muscle mass are growth hormone (GH) secretagogues. These peptide agonists act in the pituitary to increase GH secretion, leading to downstream activation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) and IGF1-mediated anabolic pathways. GH secretagogues have attracted considerable therapeutic potential as anti-frailty and anti-cachexic agents, while also being explored for growth retardation, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and cardiometabolic disease.\n\nInventors at Stanford have devised a genomic prediction algorithm to identify candidate pyroglutamyl amidated peptides that might be hidden within existing genomic sequences. By applying this algorithm to the mouse and human genomes, they have identified candidate peptides sequences with both N- and C-terminal posttranslational modifications that are 100% conserved between the two species. A subset of the synthetic peptides corresponding to these predicted sequences exhibit robust GH secretagogue activity in vitro. The inventors showed robust detection of these peptides in mouse plasma, establishing their endogenous presence. Furthermore, they have obtained evidence for a receptor-based mechanism of action that is independent of the classical GHS receptor and GHRH receptor pathways.

Extended drug delivery to the eye addresses clinical burden as well as non-compliance with eye drop regimens, low ocular absorption with drops, and the risks and burdens of intravitreal injections on patients. There are currently extended release steroid implants for the posterior segment of the eye. Recently, there was a novel drug delivery device for extended anti-VEGF medication, which involved a refillable intraocular reservoir with a diffusion filter to allow for extended release. However, due to the nature of the surgery during implantation, there are side effects including a 2% endophthalmitis rate, 5.2% vitreous hemorrhage, 3.6% conjunctival erosion, and 5.9% conjunctival bleb. This limits clinical adoptability. The lens capsule is a safe space in the eye and has an extensive safety profile for implanted intraocular lenses. Stanford researchers propose using a drug delivery scaffold for implantation in the lens capsule at the time of cataract surgery, which is known as a safe surgery with very low surgical complications. This drug delivery scaffold is used to hold the new intraocular lens at the time of cataract surgery. In addition, it contains a valved drug delivery reservoir with a diffusion filter to allow extended drug delivery. The lens capsule is between the anterior and posterior segments of the eye and will allow for extended drug delivery to the anterior chamber for anterior medications such as glaucoma medication, antibiotics, and steroids.

    "ip_description": "Active manipulation of light beams is required for a range of emerging optical technologies, including sensing, optical computing, virtual/augmented reality, dynamic holography, and computational imaging. Miniaturization of these optical components is key to facilitating their integration into a range of applications. Despite many advances, the size and weight of traditional macroscopic lenses and dynamic optical elements still take up significant space due to their use of classic optical elements. Therefore, it is highly desirable to reduce the size and weight of the dynamic optical components in such systems. Subwavelength control over the phase using ordered arrays of nanoantennae, or metasurfaces, could allow this goal to be achieved. Tunable metasurface lenses have been realized and typically use strain or thermal tuning of the entire metasurface or mechanical movement between metasurface lenses. Recent efforts have demonstrated impressive modulation of phase and color of pixel elements that could be individually actuated with high-speed microelectromechanical MEMs technology. However, these are challenging to fabricate and experience limitations in dynamic applications due to vibration instability.\n\nInventors at Stanford have created a hybrid polymer/metal tunable optical metasurface system, with operation in wavelength ranges from the visible to the infrared. It can reversibly tune the color and phase of reflected wavefronts through applications of stimuli, including applied voltage or application of suitable fluids to the surface of the metasurface. The tuning mechanism is non-volatile, involving changes in polymer thickness due to changes in thermodynamic equilibrium condition. . In the case of fluidic control, the fluid infiltrates into the polymer and causes a change in the swelling degree. In the case of electrochemical control, applied voltage leads to ion intercalation, modifying the swelling degree. Depending on the specific design chosen, this can result in a change of the reflected color from the metasurface, continuous tuning of the direction of the reflected beam, or on-off modulation between different diffraction orders. These ultra-thin devices can also be made with thicknesses of 500nm, much smaller than conventional optical elements that range from the millimeter to centimeter scale.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have developed Schottky contacts for aluminum nitride-based microelectronic devices. The contacts enable reliable device operation at up to 600 \u00baC, opening up opportunities for high temperature microelectronic performance. Microelectronics capable of operating reliably at high temperature are necessary to provide sensing, readout, and telecommunications for applications in the space, aerospace, defense, automotive, and oil and gas sectors. Typical microelectronics produced for commercial, industrial, and military grade electronics, can often only perform reliably at temperatures up to 125 \u00baC. Above these temperatures, semiconductors fail to meet critical parameters and degradation can cause permanent failure. Aluminum nitride (AlN)-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) that leverage the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) have shown promise for high temperature operations. However, the reliability is often limited by the degradation of accompanying metallization and passivation layers. This technology provides a Schottky gate material as a passivation layer on AlN that can enable reliable high-temperature operation of AlN-based HEMTs. By oxidizing iridium on the AlN surface, devices fabricated with the material have demonstrated increased stability at high temperatures. Specifically, well-known degradation mechanisms in AlN-based devices, such as metal diffusion or electromigration during electrical characterization, are absent even at temperatures up to 600 \u00baC. Thus, the material offers promise in application to a variety of AlN-based devices where high temperature performance is essential. Applications include supercritical CO2 well leak detection in carbon capture and storage processes, industrial under-the-hood automotive and aircraft engine applications, uncooled downhole sensor readout for processes in the oil and gas industry, gas turbines, hypersonic structures, and aerospace missions such as to the surface of Venus (surface temperature 465 \u00baC). Advantages include being free from deleterious strain relaxation effects at high temperature that have been demonstrated to lower the 2DEG density and adversely affect device performance in AlGaN based devices, and offering higher electron mobilities so they are better for high frequency, high temperature applications compared to silicon carbide-based devices.",

Methods to investigate neuronal networks in intact tissues have been developed but are not optimal. For instance, these methods have used antibody staining for molecular analysis.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at CZ Biohub SF and Stanford University have developed a new disease management system that enables efficient population-level tracking of disease incidence rates. In recent years, the risk of pandemics has become much more visible to the public. As a result of ongoing international development and our ever-growing proximity to populations of wild animals, viral zoonotic jumps from animals to humans are becoming more and more common. As we continue to encroach on the natural habitats of many species, including those known to be reservoir species for zoonotic viruses including bats and pigs, pandemics caused by novel viral species are almost certainly inevitable. This widespread occurrence has huge global health implications, and therefore it is an urgent unmet medical need to develop plug-and-play pandemic readiness systems. It is impossible to predict what virus or family of viruses will jump from animals to humans next, but the need to be prepared for these events is more prescient than ever. Diagnostic testing is a key component of managing these outbreaks. However, testing every person in a population daily is unwieldly, expensive, and ultimately not feasible. The inventors have developed a low-cost and efficient disease management system to allow entities to track disease incidences in a set population. This technique enables virtually any organization, from schools to employers to public health departments to track disease incidence and allows them to respond in real time to outbreaks. This program uses remote self-collection via nasopharyngeal swabs for convenience and efficient use. Participants are first screened for eligibility and asked to take a survey about their background and initial health. Selected participants then have a home self-testing kit delivered to them with samples picked up for laboratory analysis. Participants also undergo ongoing symptom surveillance via daily surveys that alert and trigger repeat testing. Through this targeted and convenient testing strategy, this platform provides algorithms to test both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals to allow for accurate population-level estimates of real time disease incidences. Participants receive the results of this testing directly on a private, secure website. Applications: Testing and evaluation of disease incidence rates in specific populations in real time, Screening individuals for symptoms on a daily basis to limit the spread of disease. Advantages: Testing strategies for both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, Ongoing symptom surveillance throughout your population in order to ensure that those experiencing symptoms undergo testing as soon as possible, limiting the spread of disease, Scalable on a population level.",

However, HD data contain multi-level information with complex relationships, and its maximal exploitation is challenging. Current methods attempt to make sense of HD data by embedding them directly onto a low dimension without explicitly considering the underlying biological characteristics of the dataset. Stanford scientists, therefore, developed a method called genomap that transforms HD data into an ordered format that allows maximization of information of specific omics data interactions, like gene-gene interactions and enables deep exploration of the resulting information by advanced signal processing techniques such as multidimensional convolution filtering. They tested this approach on various gene expression datasets and showed that it vastly improves the performance of analyses compared to existing methods. Applications include tabular HD data analysis for various applications including industrial product development and scientific research in drug discovery, genomic analysis, data classification and clustering, sensor data analysis, disease detection, marketing and finance data analysis, social media, telecommunication, etc. Advantages include being the first of its kind, transforming tabular data into a configured data format, using image processing techniques on tabular data for extracting high level information, and being applicable to a wide variety of HD data.",

Droplet microfluidics systems rely on creating droplets within a carrier, immiscible fluid, and are widely used in analytical detection in biomedical research and the clinic. Multiplexing droplet multiplexed systems is useful for increasing throughput and required for some custom assays, and several strategies have been implemented. These include multiple fluorescence dyes (e.g., using multiple emission wavelengths and color filters), barcoding of droplets using barcoded particles, and barcoding using gel beads containing barcoded synthetic DNA. When samples are labeled by color, a one-to-one relationship between color and a particle or reaction is common, limiting the degree of multiplexing. This is due to the finite bandwidth of the emission spectrum of commonly used fluorophores, and the limited range of the visible spectrum. There is a need for higher multiplexing capabilities for droplet microfluidics systems. Therefore, Stanford inventors developed a novel multiplexing method that uses fluorescence and encoding of multiple samples by the spatial and temporal sequence of droplet formations and the subsequent spatial positioning of droplets in a constrained, poorly mixed output region. This new method can be applied in varying configurations, one of which is to use four different dyes in combination with spatial positioning to achieve 48-sample multiplexing.

Coronary microvascular dysfunction is increasingly recognized in types of cardiovascular disease, underlining the need for more effective studies of cardiac pericytes under pathophysiological conditions. However, this goal was not readily achievable due to the scarcity of human primary cardiac pericytes.

Parkinson's disease is a common cause of morbidity in the aging population. A key feature of Parkinson's disease is the accumulation of a protein called alpha-synuclein, which aggregates into Lewy bodies and results in neuronal death. Alpha-synuclein gene mutations result in early onset and progressive disease, and lowering alpha-synuclein levels alleviates disease. Parkinson's disease has no cure, and current treatments aim to manage symptoms. There is, therefore, a significant need to develop novel therapies for Parkinson's disease. Therefore, Stanford researchers devised a way to target alpha-synuclein and lower its levels in vivo using viral gene transfer of mutant Cas9 coupled with a small guide RNA targeting the promoter region of the alpha-synuclein gene. Viral gene transfer was achieved using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector carrying their specially designed guide RNA delivered intrathecally into the cisterna magna.

    "ip_description": "Actigraphy, or the non-invasive study of human activity-rest cycles, is a field of study of growing importance as ambulatory and at-home monitoring of patients becomes more popular. It has the potential to revolutionize clinical trials, sleep studies, and even patient monitoring of recovery after injury or surgery. One of the most important applications of actigraphy is to understand natural sleep-wake patterns, especially since these are nearly impossible to truly replicate in a clinical or laboratory setting. With actigraphy, we can quantify the duration, timing, and quality of sleep experienced at home using automated algorithms. Actigraphy traditionally relies on data across multiple days or weeks to characterize routines and activity-rest cycles of a single person. While this may be possible for those who follow strict routines, reliance on longitudinal data collection to establish sleep patterns is not possible for those with erratic sleeping patterns or changing schedules, or in cases of shorter duration studies.\n\nThe Coleman Lab at Stanford has invented an algorithm capable of classifying sleep and wake states in a single day from triaxial accelerometer data. Traditional actigraphy relies on days to weeks' worth of activity data to characterize patterns of activity and rest within individuals, but reliance on longitudinal data is challenging for short studies and for individuals with irregular schedules. This novel, two-stage algorithm classifies sleep and wake states from a single day. The algorithm uses many features of triaxial accelerometer data to capture the signal variability, and a two-step process modeling reduces the noise from each single-stage classification alone. Additionally, existing algorithms classify sleep from proprietary actigraphy device outputs, but triaxial accelerometers are built into most smart devices and can be used by this algorithm, making tracking activity cycles more accessible. The invention is more accurate (97%) than the gold standard Cole-Kripke algorithm (60-70%) used in commercial clinical devices. This simple, automated algorithm capable of classifying sleep and wake robustly using triaxial accelerometer data on a single day basis would broaden the usability of actigraphy for clinical, research, and consumer device purposes.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   -Compatible with any wearable device that has triaxial accelerometer data capture, such as smartwatch devices from Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, and others.\n*   -Can be implemented in products to help determine sleep duration, timing, regularity, and quality for consumers who purchase these products.\n*   -Can be integrated into clinical grade wearable devices for assessing sleep, such as for at-home sleep studies or to track patients over time.\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   -Widely available measure, compared to existing methods such as the Cole-Kripke algorithm that is built for proprietary measures only\n*   -Compatible with all smart devices that have built-in triaxial accelerometers\n*   -More accurate (97%) than the gold standard Cole-Kripke algorithm (60-70%) used in commercial clinical devices",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have established a deep learning segmentation algorithm for non-contrast CT images to aid clinicians in decision making and improve the speed of symptom to treatment in acute ischemic stroke. Supervised deep learning models are powerful tools in clinical image segmentation. While these models have promise for application to stroke imaging, there are challenges in their use in non-contrast computed tomography (CT) images. Specifically, low signal to noise ratios in non-contrast CT images restrict the development of accurate reference annotations that are essential for the supervised deep learning model training. Further, the identification of acute ischemic stroke is highly time sensitive, with clinical outcomes highly correlating with the time from symptom onset to treatment. Thus, a simple model that can directly predict a probability heat map or a binary segmentation offers a fast route for clinicians to use the information contained within non-contrast CT images in clinical decision making. In this technology, a model trained on random expert sampling is established, harnessing interpretations from three expert neuroradiologists. The model can identify the location and volume of acutely ischemic brain tissue in non-contrast CT images and significantly correlates clinical outcomes. The model outperforms human expert performance, offering a faster route than current tools for clinicians to interpret non-contrast CT images for acute ischemic stroke.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists developed a novel strategy that uses resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to determine whether a person will respond to treatment for depression. Major depressive disorder (MDD), a leading cause of disability worldwide, is likely a product of abnormal communication patterns within brain-wide networks. An inability to detect biomarkers of MDD in the human brain has slowed progress in MDD treatment. Mechanism-based MDD biomarkers have eluded us due to conceptual and experimental barriers. First, it is difficult to assign a causal relationship between biomarkers and MDD because causal tests are rarely performed on seemingly MDD-related differences identified in patients. Second, although MDD arises from aberrant communication in the brain, many neuroimaging studies evaluate either tonic activity levels in individual brain regions or functional connectivity between brain regions. The latter comes with a major caveat that signaling directionality is not assigned, with possibly significant physiological implications. Stanford researchers sought to address these problems by examining how directed communication patterns in the human brain relate to the neurobiology of MDD using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and rs-fMRI. They found that active rTMS modulates the directional flow of rs-fMRI activity between different brain regions and that variance in the temporal effect's magnitude corresponds to treatment efficacy. Additionally, they found that rTMS corrects a baseline aberrancy in neural flow patterns. They also showed that the baseline temporal structure of individual patients with MDD can predict treatment response. Hence, they developed a novel biomarker for depression treatment efficacy.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a method called Identity Preserving Sample Multiplexing (IPSM) for the scaled up and rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects. At the beginning of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, reliably tracking SARS-CoV-2 among patients was a critical step in quarantining, triaging, and treating positive patients. However most hospitals were initially unable to process even 1000 tests per day due to the shortage of reagents and other resources, whereas an order of magnitude or more that number of clinical tests were needed to adequately meet patients' needs. In addition, due to the high positivity rate of tested populations, standard pooling assays (where groups of samples are co-purified and patients in positive groups are re-tested individually) were not appropriate as, by mid-March 2020, up to 25% of tests in highly populated regions such as New York were positive. Therefore, a multiplexed strategy was necessary to allow the scaling up of tests while robustly preserving patient identity. The inventors have designed an approach to non-enzymatically barcode patient samples in large collection volumes and then concentrate those samples within a pooled library. Each barcode consists of three high-melting temperature oligos that anneal at adjacent positions along the viral genome and thereby also provide a position barcode. After annealing barcoding oligos to the target viral RNA, each oligo is then ligated using an RNA-splinted ligation. The ligation product is then amplified and distributed into 2n wells and the abundance of each ligated barcode is then quantified by qPCR with patient-specific primers as a proxy for viral load. Each barcoded patient sample is also redundantly pooled in two non-overlapping patient cohorts along with positive and normalizing controls, providing replicate readouts for each patient's samples. Applications: A unified testing platform for clinical laboratories to dramatically scale up community surveillance and patient diagnostics. Identifying positive patient samples within a pooled population without the need to exhaustively reprocess all patients within positive cohorts. Advantages: The assay allows testing with a ligase rather than a reverse-transcriptase enzyme, providing an alternative way to create the template for the qPCR reaction. The assay provides quadruple redundancy to capture measurement noise for both sample barcoding and real-time qPCR. The core workflow with approximately 1000 samples can be completed in ~2.5 hours by a staff of 2-3 people, thereby the inventors' conservative estimate of throughput for this method is 10,000 samples per day for each available 384-well plate qPCR machine.

Neural stem/precursor cells (NPC) in this region have been reported to be abrogated in animal models of dementia, but it remains an open question whether this finding is a side effect or a causative factor in AD disease processes. The inventors have defined a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AD through targeting important molecular pathways in adult NPCs. Through their research, the inventors have discovered that cell-intrinsic NPC deficits are at least partially regulated by Cdkn2a, which has been implicated in tumor formation. To avoid off-target effects, the inventors modulated bone morphogenic protein receptors (BMPRs) which are highly expressed in adult NPCs. By inhibiting BMPR signaling, the inventors determined that BMPR inhibition rescues plaque formation via mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP). Prevention of the formation of mutant APP in turn prevents self-mediated renewal defects in human neurospheres. Taken together, this invention puts forth methods and compositions for treating AD patients with BMPR inhibitors. This invention provides a novel therapeutic pathway for AD, which has the potential to resolve an urgent unmet medical need in the AD field. Applications: Targeted, scientifically backed potential treatment avenue for AD using an inhibitor of BMPRs. Advantages: Current understanding of BMPR signaling provides evidence of limited off-target effects of inhibition of these receptors. This therapeutic target was discovered using human-derived neurospheres, lending to its applicability for use in humans.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists developed a comprehensive, minimally invasive, dual-catheter pulsed field device that utilizes a rapid and simple integrated mapping/ablation strategy for the treatment of Atrial Fibrillation. Atrial Fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia, is an irregular and often rapid heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots in the heart. It affects approximately five million Americans for whom medications are ineffective and invasive surgeries to create Cox-Maze surgical lesions to treat AF are often undesirable. Catheter ablation is an alternative to treat AF that is plagued by recurrence of AF, which necessitates repeat catheter ablation to curb future arrhythmias, minimal success with persistent AF, and low long-term success overall. Therefore, a solution is needed that can either recreate the Cox-Maze surgical lesions minimally invasively, better identify critical sites of ablation, or both. Stanford researchers, therefore, developed a pulsed field atrial fibrillation system that prevents AF recurrences after a single procedure. This simple system creates the set of transmural Cox-Maze surgical lesions and reliably identifies key AF ablation targets not addressed by the Cox-Maze lesion set. This system provides a unified solution absent in most recent AF treatment advances. Applications: Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. Advantages: More comprehensive system for atrial fibrillation ablation, Extensive lesion set, Incorporates a system for mapping, Minimally invasive, Reduced procedure time, Easy to use.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have developed a novel treatment for coronavirus infection. Coronavirus infections are endemic in humans and were the causative pathogen in up to 30% of seasonal upper respiratory infections prior to 2020. Several coronaviruses of interest including MERS, SARS-CoV1, and SARS-CoV2 have emerged in recent years. These novel viruses proved to be infectious to humans and arose ostensibly through zoonotic jumps from both reservoir species (bats) and amplifier species (raccoon dogs, pangolins). Of these novel coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV2 has proved to be especially worrisome, resulting in a world-wide pandemic and 6.8 million deaths as of March 2023. While mRNA vaccines have curtailed infection and mortality rates, few therapeutic drugs exist for those who do become infected. SARS-CoV2 enters cells by binding its Spike protein to the ACE2 receptor which is expressed in a myriad of tissues, including the lungs and epithelial cells that line blood vessels. SARS-CoV2's entrance into cells via the ACE2 receptor is necessary for the virus to be able replicate and cause downstream pathogenic effects. The inventors have identified inhibitors of transmembrane serine protease family member II (TMPRSS2), a known mediator of cell entry of pathogenic coronaviruses. TMPRSS2 is co-expressed in the lung with ACE2, the SARS-CoV2 entry receptor. Briefly, TMPRSS2 proteolyzes the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein at specific cleavage sites following Spike protein binding to ACE2. This cleavage event in turn allows for S2 subunit-driven fusion of viral and host cell membranes, facilitating entry of virus RNA into the cell. Animal studies have shown that inhibition of TMPRSS2 abrogates cellular entry in the lungs of several coronaviruses including MERS and SARS-CoV2. Prior to the filing of this patent, few TMPRSS2 inhibitors have been described in the literature. This invention identifies type II transmembrane serine proteinase (TTSP) inhibitor as a novel therapeutic for SARS-CoV2 infection. Using computationally modeled protein structures and protein ligand interactions, this invention identifies several TTSPs that bind strongly to TMPRSS2. Applications: Potential therapeutic for SARS-CoV2 by abrogating cellular entry of the virus via the ACE2 receptor, Potential therapeutic for other coronaviruses that utilize the ACE2 receptor for cellular entry. Advantages: Can be administered in addition to other anti-viral drugs for a compounded effect due to differing mechanisms of action, Fills an urgent unmet medical need for therapeutics for those with SARS-CoV2 infections.",

    "ip_number": "S20-303",
    "published_date": "28 December 2020",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a method for real-time wireless resistive sensing using non-linear PT-symmetry. Fully passive sensors are lower cost and less complex than their active sensor counterparts. Indeed, fully passive sensors consist of two primary components: an inductor and a sensing element. Sensing elements are either a capacitor or a resistor whose value fluctuates in response to a measurable parameter. This measurable parameter is read in fully passive sensors by magnetically coupling a primary or reader coil to the sensor coil. Sensor measurement is performed by detecting fluctuations in the impedance profile (the effective resistance of an electric circuit or component to alternating current) of the reader coil that corresponds to variations in the sensor. Measuring these fluctuations proves difficult due to the necessity of sizeable lab equipment and the fact that measurements are prone to errors when performed at different distances and orientations. However, when a resonant reader (inductive-capacitive) is tuned to the same resonant frequency as the sensor, it improves the sensitivity of the sensor to fluctuations. This results in impedance fluctuations with sharper features, allowing for more accurate measurements. The inventors establish a sensing method that enables robust measurement in a real-time, distance immune fashion. This system uses fully passive resistive sensors for coupling independent, powerful wireless sensing. This invention removes the need for sweeping, which allows the system to convey real-time, single point sensing. Self-oscillation remarkably simplifies the reader and is achieved through a fast-settling nonlinearity. This fast-settling nonlinearity has a voltage amplitude that is proportional to the sensor's resistance. Additionally, system analysis is generalized to arbitrary operating conditions through a dual time-scale theoretical framework. Finally, detuning from PT-symmetric conditions by an order of magnitude allows for a robust correction strategy that reduces errors in the system. This technology is largely applicable to health care innovations, specifically wearable, bedside, or point of care health monitoring and sensing due to its cost effective and light-weight properties.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have discovered that the absence of a long non coding RNA (lnc122) predisposed mice to high numbers of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), and its replacement decreased the risk of HCC. Mechanistic studies revealed that lnc122 acts via degradation of the oncogenic protein Myc. Consequently, methods to increase lnc122 expression can be used to treat a variety of Myc driven and/or dependent cancers.\n\nDysregulation of the _MYC_ proto-oncogene occurs in ~70% of all human cancers and is linked to poor prognosis. Accordingly, the Myc protein is a transcription factor that is a major driver of tumorigenesis and a well-established cancer target for a variety of cancers, including liver cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, among others. However, inhibition of Myc has proven difficult due to its lack of a traditionally druggable binding pocket and primarily nuclear localization. Alternative methods for targeting Myc are being pursued, such as targeting _MYC_ transcription or mRNA translation, preventing its function as a transcription factor by blocking binding of Myc to chromatin or Max, and promoting Myc degradation via the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS). While these strategies are promising and numerous clinical studies are being pursued, there have yet to be approved cancer drugs targeting Myc.\n\nThis technology offers a contrasting strategy to promote Myc degradation via the UPS. Current approaches to hijack the UPS include proteolysis-targeting chimaeras (PROTACs), which bring the target protein and E3 protein ligase into close proximity with a heterobifunctional molecule. This strategy is difficult in the case of Myc as high affinity ligands for the target protein are required. In contrast, here, the inventors found that a long non coding RNA present in hepatocytes, lnc122, serves as a mediator for E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR5-dependent Myc degradation. Specifically, lnc122 enhances the binding of UBR5 to Myc, resulting in ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Myc. While lnc122 is naturally present primarily in liver cells, UBR5-dependent ubiquitination occurs across tissues. Thus, strategies which increase the expression and/or presence of lnc122 can be applied to promote Myc degradation in a variety of tumor types.\n\nApplications:\n- Therapeutics for Myc driven/dependent cancers\n\nAdvantages:\n- By targeting a driver oncogene/protein such as Myc, therapies can be developed for cancers that currently have no targeted therapies\n- Tumors are highly dependent on driver oncogenes, making targeting these drivers such as MYC highly promising for significant clinical benefit\n- Myc is a promising cancer target, but is difficult to target with traditional approaches, such as small molecules and antibodies\n- Lnc122 enables targeted degradation of Myc via the UPS system and can be applied to a variety of tumor types",

To this end, Stanford and Baylor researchers have found that lactoyl-phenylalanine, an exercise-induced metabolite, suppresses appetite by direct action on Agrp and Pomc neurons in the brain. The researchers have shown that administration of lactoyl-phenylalanine to obese mice suppresses food intake, reduces body weight, and improves glucose homeostasis.\n\nStage of Development\nIn vivo: Researchers have shown that lactoyl phenylalanine hyperpolarizes Agrp neurons in electrophysiological studies and also reduces body weight in mice.\n\nApplications\n- Therapeutic for obesity\n- Therapeutic for diabetes\n- Therapeutic for other metabolic disorders\n\nAdvantages\n- Novel metabolite with newly identified function\n- Novel structure",

    "ip_description": "Stanford inventors have created a novel, interactive, highly scalable computational approach for representing dynamic brain activity as a network for use in clinical settings. Neuroimaging is essential to understanding human brain function in health and disease. Clinicians and researchers generate large volumes of neuroimaging data from various modalities, including fMRI, that require extensive processing to be interpretable. Therefore, it is necessary to develop computational tools to create simple representations from complex, high-dimensional neuroimaging data. These simple representations can then be utilized in research and clinical settings. Previously, Stanford inventors developed an approach using the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis (TDA) to generate these simple representations for neuroimaging data (Saggar et al. 2018; Geniesse et al. 2019; Saggar et al. 2022). In this current method, Stanford inventors sought to extend the capabilities of their previous work and its applications to large-scale neuroimaging datasets (Geniesse, Chowdhury, and Saggar, 2022). They modified the underlying algorithm\u2014improving its scalability and simplifying parameter selection\u2014to accelerate and enable applications involving high-dimensional neuroimaging data. The new, scalable Mapper algorithm can create interactive network representations of dynamic brain activity data. It is also capable of operating on large repositories of high-dimensional neuroimaging data (i.e., thousands of individuals' full-length scans). They also developed new analytical tools for annotating and extracting neurobiological and behavioral insights from the generated representations, including a new way to compare different representations using techniques from optimal transport theory. Hence, they hope to facilitate the translation of precision neuroimaging to clinical settings\u2014by enabling the fast construction of interpretable and interactive representations of individuals' data. Applications: Generates an interpretable report from a functional brain scan.

Synthetic peptide vaccines are inexpensive, easy to administer, and can be leveraged against both cancer and pathogens. Improved peptide sequences could boost vaccine effectiveness, but sequence optimization methods are currently limited to painstaking cell-based screens and poorly validated _in silico_ prediction. These efforts are limited by a lack of understanding of the proteosome processing step that occurs before peptides are presented as extracellular antigens. To address this need, researchers in the Wong lab have developed design principles and screening methods that produce peptides with enhanced proteosome processing and cancer immunization. One improvement in sequence optimization comes from the inclusion of proteasome catalyzed peptide splicing (PCPS), which has been previously overlooked as a major determinant of proteosome activity.

Microglia heterogeneity and function in health and disease remains an important and elusive question. RNA Sequencing has revolutionized the transcriptomic analysis of microglia, and the scientific community has churned out large RNA-sequencing microglial datasets. However, follow-up studies manipulating microglia in vivo to validate functions inferred from RNA-sequencing data are needed. Current tools for microglial manipulation include various genetically modified mouse models, all of which are time-intensive and are infeasible for screening multiple candidate genes from transcriptomic datasets if one is financially- and space-constrained.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have identified new CDK19-selective inhibitors for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer. Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. While early cancer detection methods such as genetic biomarker screening and regular mammograms have significantly reduced breast cancer mortality in resource-rich settings, treatment options have lagged. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to breast cancer that is estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 negative and is known to have significantly worse treatment outcomes than other breast cancer subtypes, reducing median survival time by 13 months. This decreased survival time is in part due to available treatment strategies as TNBC is unable to be treated with target-specific therapies. Subsequently, the only treatment available to TNBC patients are non-specific treatments such as chemotherapy, which is often less effective, highly cytotoxic, and results in long-term sequelae. Cyclin-dependent kinases, specifically CDK19 and its related isoform CDK8, form complexes with other proteins to regulate RNA polymerase association and transcriptional activity. Compounds that inhibit both CDK19 and CDK8 have been of interest in recent years as anti-cancer therapies, including in TNBC. However, these targets have been abandoned due to off-target effects of CDK8 inhibition, likely caused by its wider tissue distribution as compared to CDK19. A compound that selectively inhibits CDK19 while limiting off-target inhibition of CDK8 has not yet been described in the literature. Given the current lack of treatment options, there is an urgent unmet need to investigate potential therapeutic targets for TNBC. The inventors isolated and characterized a number of compounds that selectively inhibit CDK19 over CDK8. These compounds were assayed using FRET displacement to determine CDK19 selectivity indexes (CDK19 IC50 / CD8K IC50). It was determined that many of the isolated compounds had high CDK19 selectivity, with compound A4 performing exceptionally well with a selectivity index of greater than 50. Furthermore, treatment with CDK19-selective inhibitors in an in vitro TNBC cell line resulted in significant cell death, indicating its efficacy in killing TNBC cancer cells. When CDK19-selective inhibitors were incubated with a human fibroblast cell line in vitro, they did not exhibit significant cell death as compared to controls, suggesting that CDK19-selective inhibitors are not broadly cytotoxic. Indeed, when patient-derived TNBC organoids were treated with compound A4 and subsequently allowed to regrow without pharmacological intervention, TNBC cancer cells failed to regrow when compared to organoids treated with a non-selective CDK19/CDK8 inhibitor and DMSO negative controls. Taken together, these studies suggest that CDK19 selective inhibitors described by the inventors are promising therapeutic candidates for TNBC, with compound A4 being especially promising. Applications: Targeted, non-cytotoxic therapeutic for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Advantages: In vitro studies suggest that these compounds are not broadly cytotoxic. These compounds are a targeted therapy, which lends to them being a more effective treatment option than non-specific TNBC therapies such as chemotherapy. The compounds described by the inventors selectively inhibit CDK19 over CDK8, leading to fewer off-target effects.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a technology that uses biomechanical force to initiate T-cell triggering in a high throughput method, facilitating the exploration of the force- and sequence-dependent landscape of T-cell responses. Adaptive immunity relies on the ability of T-cells to sensitively discriminate self from non-self, and to thereby detect pathogen infection or malignant transformations. This discrimination hinges on the ability of T-cell receptors (TCR) to recognize specific peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on antigen presenting cells, which triggers downstream signaling events and T-cell effector functions. However, the relationship between TCR binding and triggering is not fully understood. For instance, measured in vitro affinities with a presented peptide do not always correlate with stimulation of T-cell activity, as some of the most potent stimulatory peptides bind with only weak or moderate affinities. Recent evidence suggests that the pN to nN biomechanical forces generated at the TCR-pMHC interface during T-cell immunosurveillance and synapse formation may be critical for sensitive and specific recognition. Distinguishing agonist peptides from non-agonist peptides therefore requires an in vitro assay in the presence of applied loads that quantifies binding and downstream activation. Currently available screening approaches can only quantify peptide binding alone, and not T-cell activation, and they take place in the absence of force and present peptides at artificially high concentrations, thereby reducing their physiological relevance. Several mechanobiology methods exist that can exert well-calibrated shear loads on T-cells interacting with specific pMHCs displayed at low densities, however these techniques typically require expensive equipment, are labor intensive, and are limited in peptide throughput. A peptide screening method that could probe both TCR binding and triggering at a high throughput level is needed. The inventors have developed a novel technology called BATTLES for Biomechanically-Assisted T-cell Triggering for Large-scale Exogenous-pMHC Screening. This technique profiles T-cell signaling responses for thousands of cells interacting with different pMHCs at low densities and in the presence of physiological shear loads within a single experiment. BATTLES displays candidate pMHCs on spectrally encoded 'smart beads' capable of applying physiological loads to T cells. T-cells are deposited onto the surface of hydrogel 'smart beads' bearing pMHCs that swell upon small changes in temperature. To monitor downstream signaling responses via high-throughput single-cell microscopy, T-cells and 'smart beads' are loaded into microcell arrays in the presence of a Ca2+-sensitive dye. Applications include: 'Smart beads' can apply well-calibrated loads to single T-cells; Spectrally encoded 'smart beads' allow simultaneous testing of many potential antigenic sequences; 'Smart beads' can display peptides at low physiological densities to mimic in vivo conditions; T-cells can be paired with 'smart' beads for high-throughput monitoring of force- and sequence-dependent activation; BATTLES can be applied to identify novel peptide agonists; Multiplexing applied loads can elucidate 'catch' versus 'slip' bond behavior in a single experiment; Multiplexing pMHC sequences and concentrations can be used to study dose-dependent immunogenicity. Advantages include: The BATTLES platform is the first mechanobiology tool that recapitulates the physicochemical cues of active force and low monomeric pMHC density; BATTLES screens many peptide sequences for their potential to bind TCRs and activate downstream signaling responses in a combined, high throughput format.",

Multiplexed bioassays have drastically improved our understanding of complex biological process in recent years. In these assays, binding is measured between a single \"bait\" molecule and many \"prey\" molecules to provide a comprehensive understanding of interactome networks. While spatial arrays comprised the first generation of these technologies, they have been outpaced by multiplexed microbead assays which allow for many replicates per experiment, opportunities for quality control, and the ability to vary different probes and targets over multiple experiments. Spectrally encoded microbeads assays such as the Luminex platform use microbeads that are combined in ratiometric proportions with fluorescent or luminescent materials. However, these techniques have a limited possible coding space, are often ill-suited for solid-phase synthesis applications due to their incompatibility with harsh organic solvents, and have difficulty detecting low affinity interactions. The inventors have created a novel technology named MRBLES 2.0, an acronym for microspheres with ratiometric barcode lanthanide encoding. This technology involves ratiometrically incorporating lanthanide phosphors (Lns) to produce spectrally encoded beads. The previous iteration of MRBLES had complex production pipelines that required two-layer microfluidic devices with custom pneumatics control hardware and resulted in slow and laborious bead generation. However, MRBLES 2.0 utilizes manual mixing of Lns and polymers followed by droplet generation using a single-layer parallel flow-focusing device that increases the throughput of the assay from ~6600 beads/hour generated to ~9,000,000 beads/hour. MRBLES 2.0 also allows for the localization of copolymers bearing functional groups used for bioconjugation to the surface of the hydrogel matrix during droplet generation, allowing this method of bead generation to be used in applications requiring bioconjugation. MRBLES 2.0 provides an innovative, high throughput method for the generation of barcoded beads that expands the possible coding space as well as allows for additional applications with the addition of bioconjugation capabilities. Applications include generation of multiplexed microbeads for use in bioassays using lanthanides (Lns) as barcodes, and MRBLES 2.0 is a broadly useful pipeline with potential applications in the detection of DNA hybridization, identifying protein-protein or protein/peptide interactions, and screening polymers for useful bioactivity. Advantages of MRBLES include the use of lanthanides allowing for a greater possible coding space given that Lns have narrow and well-separated emission spectra, increased throughput of bead generation up to 9,000,000 beads per hour, and the ability for bioconjugation using the addition of capture molecules on the surface of the hydrogel matrix during droplet generation.",

Characterization of antibody binding requires recombinant cloning and expression of purified protein for use in functional assays, however current methods are insufficient. Single-cell approaches enable high-throughput determination of native antibody sequences, yet sequence information alone is not sufficient to predict antibody specificity and affinity. Droplet- and micro-well-based single-cell techniques can identify over ten thousand natively paired antibody heavy- and light-chain gene sequences in one experiment. However, producing antibody DNA by gene synthesis is costly and time consuming compared to complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning, while current methods for producing cDNA pool thousands of cells, rendering isolation of antibody cDNA from individual cells difficult. Therefore, a method for the simultaneous high-throughput determination of antibody sequences and the rapid cloning and expression of individual antibodies from suitable antibody cDNA is needed.\n\n**Stage of Development**\nResearch -\n_in vitro_\n\n**Stage of Research**\nThe inventors created a strategy for cloning antibody heavy- and light-chain cDNA from a single B cell within a pooled library called selective PCR for antibody retrieval (SPAR). The technique leverages the unique sequence barcodes attached to cDNA molecules during sample preparation, which typically include a cell barcode (CBC) to distinguish individual cells and a unique molecular identifier (UMI) used to distinguish individual molecules of template RNA. After sequencing, the antibody heavy- and light-chain sequences and their corresponding sequences barcodes are identified. The barcodes and the heavy- and light-chain sequences are then used as unique molecular tags to retrieve cDNA from an individual cell.

Currently, a promising approach is moving from lithium-ion batteries, for which current technologies are close to the energy density theoretical limit, to new materials. Anodes composed of lithium metal, instead of the traditional graphite, have been shown to increase anode specific capacity by about 10-fold. Yet, commonly used electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries are incompatible with lithium metal anodes. Recently developed electrolytes that are compatible with lithium metal often have limitations including low initial Columbic efficiencies, slow ion transport properties, incompatibility with high-voltage cathodes, and expensive salts and/or solvents that limit scalability.\n\nWhen combined with commonly used salts, the fluorinated acetal electrolyte based formulations in this technology can overcome many of these challenges faced by current electrolytes. Fast stabilization of lithium metal provides high Columbic efficiencies (greater than 99%) within the first 10 cycles. Fast ion transport properties result in low cell impendence. The electrolytes display good compatibility with existing high-voltage cathodes. Finally, the fluorinated acetals are synthesized in high yields from common chemical feedstocks and are combined with standard inexpensive salts, enabling cost-effective and scalable electrolyte production.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the University of California Berkeley and Stanford have developed a bespoke, high throughput method for determining DNA-protein interactions in highly repetitive portions of the human genome. Protein-DNA interactions are essential to the reading, regulation, and replication of genomic DNA. Systematic mapping of these interactions provides key insights into vital cellular functions in both healthy and disease states. Current approaches to determining genome-wide interactions with a protein of interest (ChIP-Seq, CUT & RUN) were developed using short-read next generation sequencing (NGS), where short reads (~200bp) are mapped to a reference genome by stitching together uniquely overlapping sequencing reads. However, some highly repetitive regions of the human genome are unable to be correctly assembled using this technology because short repetitive sequences often lack unique overlaps that assembly algorithms rely upon. Long-read sequencing technology has made it possible to assemble some of these genomic regions for the first time as recently as 2020, and has elucidated their role key biological processes including chromosome segregation, nuclear organization, and transcriptional regulation. Additionally, current techniques rely on amplification-based readouts which have intrinsic biases and therefore only provide a semi-quantitative picture of protein-DNA interaction frequencies. The inventors of the new method, DiMeLo-Seq, establish a novel way to quantify DNA-protein interactions in previously unexplored, highly repetitive portions of the human genome. This method combines elements of previously established antibody-directed protein-DNA mapping techniques with nanopore sequencing to elucidate interactions. Briefly, cells are permeabilized and incubated with a primary antibody to target a DNA-interacting protein of interest. Next, a non-specific deoxyadenosine methyltransferase fused with antibody binding protein A (pA-Hia5) is allowed to bind to the primary antibody and all unbound pA-Hia5 is washed away. Nuclei are then incubated with methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which allows for adenosine methylation near the protein interaction of interest. Finally, DNA is isolated and sequenced using modification sensitive long-read sequencing to detect the frequency of adenosine methylation in genomic regions of interest, providing a quantitative readout of genomic sites of protein-DNA interaction. Applications: Map multiple DNA-protein interaction sites on single DNA molecules, Infer protein interaction frequency at each genomic site across cells, Map haplotype-specific DNA interactions with proteins of interest, Identify protective or maladaptive DNA-protein interactions in healthy and disease states. Advantages: This technology is able to map DNA-protein interactions in previously unexplored, highly repetitive portions of the genome up to 1,000 kilobases in length, Method allows for fully quantitative measurements of DNA-protein interactions whereas other current methods are only semi-quantitative, Compatible with both Oxford Nanopore and PacBio high fidelity (HiFi) sequencing technologies.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a method for identifying a subject that is at risk of progression to clinically significant COVID-19 infection or disease. A minority of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 mount an extreme inflammatory response that is implicated in the disease's pathogenesis. Mechanisms contributing to this response are not well understood. Antibodies formed early during infection can bind virus particles, forming immune complexes that neutralize or mediate clearance of virus. However, immune complexes can also promote inflammation and exacerbate symptoms of disease via interactions between antibody Fc domains and Fc gamma receptors, particularly on myeloid cells, which are central regulators of the inflammatory response. How antibodies within immune complexes modulate infection depends, in part, on their Fc domain structure. IgG is the dominant antibody isotype in systemic antiviral immunity. The inventors and others have found that a high abundance of afucosylated IgG antibodies is linked to severe COVID-19, however whether afucosylated IgG production is a consequence of, or an antecedent to, the development of more severe COVID-19 remained unclear. Two independent cohorts were assessed during an initial period of mild COVID-19 and it was found that the absence of neutralizing antibodies and an increased abundance of afucosylated IgG was associated with a rapid progression to more severe disease. Elevated frequencies of monocytes expressing the receptor for afucosylated IgG, CD16a, were also associated with more severe outcomes. Immune complexes formed from SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-elicited IgG did not trigger the robust immune activation that was associated with afucosylated IgG in vivo. The researchers have therefore established a method for determining that a subject is symptomatic or prone to present one or more symptoms of COVID-19 and at risk of progression to clinically significant COVID-19 infection. Applications: Elevated production of afucosylated IgG was found to precede onset of severe disease symptoms, and stayed high over time. Combining searches for early non-neutralizing titers and afucosylated anti-spike IgG could separate progressors from non-progressors towards severe disease with higher accuracy than either attribute alone. mRNA vaccination elicits the production of neutralizing IgG with glycoforms that are distinct from those elicited by infection. Advantages: The development of prognostic biomarkers and clarification in the mechanisms underlying the distinct trajectories in COVID-19 may help halt disease progression to severe COVID-19.

Characterizing the transcriptional state of single cells has primarily focused on protein-coding RNA. However, a growing number of studies indicate that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are actively involved in cell function and specialization. In addition, protein-coding RNA is transcribed from only 1-2% of the genome, whereas ncRNA covers ~70% of the genomic content and the majority of all cellular transcripts. The role of these transcripts in shaping different cell types and states remains poorly understood. Current techniques aimed at measuring ncRNA in single cells can only target a certain subset of noncoding transcripts, and no current method can simultaneously quantify all RNA types within a cell. Thus, the ability to map the regulatory connection between coding and noncoding transcripts within a cell is limited. This gap motivates the need for a novel single cell technology capable of assaying both poly(A)+ and poly(A)- RNA, irrespective of transcript length. The inventors developed a 'one-pot' scalable method designed to capture both coding and noncoding transcripts regardless of their length. This method, named Smart-seq-total, harnesses the template-switching capability of MMLV reverse transcriptase to generate full-length cDNA with high yield and quality. Smart-seq-total captures nonpolyadenylated RNA through template-independent addition of poly(A) tails, and further oligo-dT priming of all cellular transcripts, meaning all RNA molecules can also be tagged with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). SMART-seq-total thereby quantifies mRNA and other types of RNA in the same cell. Applications include the annotation of cell types and states based on integration of mRNA data with other existing scRNA-seq datasets, and the discovery of non-coding regulatory patterns of the respective cell types and states. Advantages include the sensitivity of Smart-seq-total estimated based on external RNA control consortium capture is comparable to Smart-seq2, Smart-seq-total detects a broader spectrum of RNA types than previous single-cell approaches, and Smart-seq-total allows the incorporation of UMIs for absolute quantitation into both short and long RNA molecules.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Stanford inventors have developed an information theoretic, seizure detection algorithm for electroencephalography (EEG) towards improving diagnosis, management, and treatment of patients with epilepsy. Epilepsy affects approximately 1% of the world's population, and when inadequately treated, it carries a lifetime risk of mortality of approximately 25%. About a fifth to a third of epilepsy patients are refractory to treatment, and many patients undergo intracranial neuromonitoring studies, involving surgically implanted electrodes in the brain, to localize their seizure source. Treatment options for patients with refractory focal epilepsy include surgical resection, laser ablation, vagal nerve stimulation, and responsive neurostimulation. However, there is no guarantee that a patient will become seizure-free with most of these treatments. Better diagnostic tools are needed to guide clinical interventions and management of patients with epilepsy. Stanford researchers, therefore, developed an algorithm that informs seizure activity to better diagnose, manage, and treat patients with epilepsy. The method detects seizures using information theoretic estimates of joint entropy by leveraging data compression. It is purely an algorithm (transformation) that requires no supervised learning, model fitting, or training data. Automatic seizure detection based on objective measures can speed up and improve manual EEG reviews. Reliable biomarkers for seizure activity enable device-based therapies that programmatically stimulate and disrupt seizures once detected. This approach has been reduced to practice on intracortical data and also has been preliminarily confirmed on ECoG and surface EEG recordings. Applications: Clinical monitoring for patients with epilepsy, Automated seizure detection, Validation/verification of manual review of EEG data. Advantages: Higher performance than existing model-free methods. Provides a better understanding of the location, nature, and quality of seizures. No need for electrode selection, which requires expert interpretation, because the algorithm supports aggregate (multichannel/multielectrode) data. Model-free algorithm makes no assumptions about the structure of neural data and requires no training data. Manual EEG reviews can be augmented with robust quantitative measures. Can create opportunities to improve the diagnosis and treatment for people with epilepsy.",

    "ip_description": "Despite their cytotoxic capacity, neutrophils are often co-opted by cancers to promote immunosuppression, tumor growth, and metastasis. Consequently, these cells have received little attention as potential cancer immunotherapeutic agents. However, Stanford researchers have demonstrated in mouse models that neutrophils can be harnessed to induce durable eradication of tumors and reduce metastasis through the combined actions of tumor necrosis factor, CD40 agonist, and tumor-binding antibody. The same combination activates human neutrophils _in vitro_, enabling their lysis of human tumor cells. Mechanistically, this therapy induces rapid mobilization and tumor infiltration of neutrophils along with complement activation in tumors. Complement component C5a activates neutrophils to produce leukotriene B4, which stimulates reactive oxygen species production via xanthine oxidase, resulting in oxidative damage and T cell-independent clearance of multiple tumor types. These results establish neutrophils as potent anti-tumor immune mediators and reveal a previously unappreciated inflammatory pathway that can be harnessed to drive neutrophil-mediated eradication of cancer. Applications: Cancer immunotherapy. Advantages: Novel molecular composition - the lab is unaware of any other cancer therapy based on the activation of tumor-killing neutrophils. The Neutrophil Activating Therapy (NAT) cures a variety of solid tumor types in mice, works in the absence of T lymphocytes, activates tumor-specific T cells and induces tumor-specific T cell memory, and can potentially prevent metastatic cancer.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have discovered a new type of integrin-mediated cell adhesion, called curved adhesion, that represents the dominant structure in 3D physiological environments. Further, they have developed cell-based models and a phenotypic assay for the development of integrin therapeutics. Integrins proteins are the primary cell membrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion in mammals, anchoring the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrins, composed of an alpha and beta subunit with 24 known heterodimers, are essential for cell mechanotransduction, signaling, survival and migration. Dysregulation of integrin signaling contributes to the development of various diseases, making integrins key therapeutic targets in indications including thrombosis, autoimmune disorders, fibrotic diseases, microbial infections, and many types of cancer. While several integrin inhibitors are marketed drugs, therapeutic success has only been achieved for four integrin isoforms. Inhibitors targeting other integrin isoforms, particularly those in the alpha-v subfamily, which are indicated in cancers and fibrotic diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and nonalcoholic fatty liver syndrome (NASH), have faced significant challenges. In particular, inhibitors for alpha-v-containing integrins have demonstrated encouraging in vitro results, but have failed to show significant therapeutic benefits in clinical trials, despite their high safety profiles. The discrepancy between preclinical and clinical studies suggests that the preclinical models used in the drug discovery programs failed to accurately represent the in vivo physiology. The inventors have discovered a new type of integrin function, called curved adhesion. To date, focal adhesions have been the most widely studied integrin-mediated cell adhesions likely due to their formation on ECM-coated flat surfaces, such as in 2D cell culture. Focal adhesions, which are driven by mechanical tension and require high substrate rigidity, were believed to be the dominant adhesion structure and were the primary target for integrin therapeutic development. However, ECM in tissues is largely composed of entangled protein fibers that are often too soft to support the assembly of focal adhesions. Curved adhesions, in contrast, are driven by membrane curvature instead of mechanical tension and can thus anchor cells to soft ECM fibers. Curved adhesions can co-exist with focal adhesions but are structurally and functionally distinct. In particular, curved adhesions are exclusively mediated by the alpha-v beta-5 integrin isoform, which is upregulated in many cancers and fibrotic diseases. The present studies indicate that curved adhesions dominate in 3D physiological environments. Therefore, targeting curved adhesions rather than focal adhesions offers a promising route towards the discovery of effective integrin drugs, particularly those for alpha-v-containing isoforms. This technology presents a new platform to induce formation of curved adhesions in cell culture for the discovery of integrin therapeutics targeting curved adhesions. Additionally, it provides a proximity-based phenotypic assay for detecting curved adhesion inhibitors in high throughput screens.",

The resulting shapes are better suited for a user-defined objective, particularly for applications in charged-particle optics and trapped ion quantum computing hardware. Optimization of geometric shapes to improve the performance of electromagnetic devices is a challenging problem. While lens design optimization packages are widely used for the design of optical devices, similar tools are not available for electron devices. Current prototyping processes for electromagnetic devices often rely primarily on the intuition of the scientist or engineer. Available simulation packages commonly calculate the device performance based on an existing shape, but have limited optimization capabilities. Thus, users often must manually vary the device shape before determining device performance.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford University have developed an affinity capture technique for top-down protein analysis that directly couples biolayer interferometry (BLI) with high resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). Top-down mass spectrometry (TD-MS) is widely used to provide structural information, such as post-translational modifications and proteoform variation, on intact proteins. While a powerful method for characterizing intact protein structure, the quality of data acquired during TD-MS is highly dependent on the sample preparation. To prepare samples for MS analysis, protein analytes are typically purified from complex biological mixtures using an affinity (or immunoaffinity) capture technique on beads or resin. Yet, conventional affinity capture lacks real-time process monitoring, making optimization of sample preparation in case of weak or absent MS signal challenging. Alternatively, Biolayer Interferometry (BLI), a label-free optical sensing technology, is widely used to study the kinetics and affinity of real-time biomolecular interactions. BLI necessarily monitors the affinity capture of analytes in real-time, but cannot provide any structural information on the captured binding partners. Thus, the combination of BLI and TD-MS can provide both real-time monitoring of protein capture and structural identification. However, development of a seamless coupling method between these two technologies has been hindered by the small sample quantity that can be captured on the BLI microprobe tips. To address this challenge, this technology directly couples BLI with HR-MS with a method called Microprobe-Capture In-Emitter Elution (MPIE). To implement MPIE, the analyte is first captured on the surface of a microprobe (Figure 1A), the microprobe is directly inserted into an electrospray emitter, and the analyte is eluted by spraying into a mass spectrometer for HR-MS analysis (Figure 1B). In comparison to conventional affinity capture techniques such as bead-based immunoprecipitation, MPIE introduces real-time process monitoring and provides binding characteristics of analytes, offering more information-rich experimental results.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers developed a system that uses an individual's genetic information to predict autoimmune/inflammatory disease risk. Predictions made can be used to identify suitable candidates for precision therapies targeted at the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing pathways. Immunogenic dsRNAs are linked to inflammation in about 14% of autoimmune and inflammatory disease patients. Predicting disease risk using dsRNA burden identifies individuals suited for precision therapies targeting dsRNA-sensing pathways.\n\nStanford researchers have shown that increased dsRNA levels are strongly correlated with a higher risk for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Hence, they developed a system that uses genetic information to predict immunogenic dsRNA levels. The system collects genetic information and uses it to calculate an immunogenic dsRNA score (IDS).

Visualizing molecular tissue organization is essential for understanding normal and abnormal biological functions. Various highly multiplexed imaging technologies available today can be used to visualize intra- and inter-cellular molecular features at the nano- and microscale. Although these technologies can determine cellular positioning in tissues, their ability to resolve subcellular elements is limited. Those that can overcome these spatial resolution problems are burdened by high water content limits, challenges in multiplexed imaging, difficulties in retaining protein epitopes for antibody-based imaging, and applications to archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. The Nolan lab developed the current invention to overcome the above limitations. The current invention enables the interrogation of biomolecular organization in physically expanded hydrogel-embedded tissues and the subsequent complete removal of water molecules in the hydrogel while retaining the expanded lateral dimensions. High-content visualization of tissue organization across multiple scales can then be achieved using analytical methods, including mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Applications include imaging assays for the detection of biomolecular neighborhood signatures in tissue samples at high-plex dimensions and sub 100nm resolutions.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford, Yale, Rutgers, and the Karolinska Institute (Sweden) have developed a rapid and cheap method to detect genetic material from pathogenic infections (viral, bacterial, etc.) using electrical impedance measurement of amplified DNA nanoballs. Widely available diagnostic tests for infectious diseases are essential for managing public health. Optimal scalable diagnostic tests are fast, cheap, highly accurate, and can be completed at home. While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are the gold standard for accuracy, they are slow, expensive, and must be performed in specialized laboratory facilities. Antigen-detection tests are lower in cost and portable, but often sacrifice accuracy. Tests for genetic material based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) have gained traction due to their lower cost and faster speed, but comparable accuracy to PCR tests. LAMP is a method of DNA detection that enables rapid amplification of a specific gene at constant temperature. Negating the need for variable temperatures, as is required for PCR tests, increases the scalability and application of LAMP tests to higher volumes and lower resource facilities. However, LAMP amplification has been typically paired with fluorescence based or colorimetric readouts, which requires costly detection instrumentation, making the application to ultra-cheap, disposable, and/or widespread at home tests challenging. This technology uses a similar amplification strategy to LAMP, but instead of colorimetric detection, relies on an electrical impedance measurement as the detection output. This is achieved by adding a compaction component to DNA amplification which folds the amplified DNA into micron-sized nanoballs. The presence of these nanoballs can then be directly detected by changes in impedance when the nanoballs flow through a microfluidic channel. The ease of detection for electrical signals along with the high accuracy of DNA amplification enables the technology to be applied to cheap, fast, and portable devices for high accuracy diagnostic tests for infectious diseases.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed two novel, minimally invasive neochordal devices for mitral valve repair. The first, described in S19-432, is a high-impact, minimally invasive, percutaneous, transcatheter device that does not require open heart surgery nor cardiopulmonary bypass. It is administered percutaneously, entering the venous system, targeting the mitral valve through the atrial septum. This approach allows for direct positioning of a neochord spanning the mitral leaflet and left ventricular myocardium, a surgery known as posterior ventricular anchoring neochordal (PVAN) repair. This technology is far superior to existing transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair technologies because it aims at percutaneously implanting a neochord, as opposed to creating a double-orifice valve, as double orifice valves have been shown to increase harmful stenosis and forces on the valvular system. This technique replicates the gold standard, neochordal repair procedure, while edge-to-edge repair recapitulates an outdated technique that leads to worse outcomes. Moreover, the shorter neochord lengths due to the posterior ventricular targeting has been shown to reduce chordal forces on the valve, leading to a potentially more durable repair.\n\nThe second device is a neochord anchoring prosthetic for transapical off-pump mitral valve repair. The device is an elastic post inserted into the apex of the heart following neochord leaflet attachment. This device, functioning like an artificial papillary muscle, serves as an anchor for one or more neochordae. The elasticity and shortened neochord lengths mitigate the elevated chordal stresses associated with apical anchoring, aiming to reducing chordal forces and neochord pull out frequency and minimizing blood leakage.\n\nDr. Joseph Woo, renowned chairman and surgeon of Stanford Cardiothoracic Surgery, invented these devices and the PVAN procedure, which has been shown to provide tremendous repair results and patient outcomes. Moreover, recent studies have shown that shorter neochord lengths, accomplished with posterior left ventricular targeting and elastic transapical anchors, result in reduced forces on the neochordae and surrounding existing chordal architecture, translating to very low failure rates, reduced fatigue damage, greater repair durability, and outstanding patient outcomes. The inventions directly address some of the largest concerns regarding treatment of one of the most prevalent valvular diseases in the world, enabling a higher quality repair without the trauma of major surgery nor the rare expertise of surgeons from high volume treatment centers and leveraging advanced, minimally invasive technologies of the future.\n\nApplications:\n- Percutaneous, transcatheter, neochordal mitral valve repair in a beating heart\n- Stand-alone medical device for implanting artificial chordae with any beating heart\n- Concomitant implanted medical device for improving transapical neochordal repair biomechanics and outcomes\n\nAdvantages:\n- High quality repair technique: These devices are associated with a repair and not valve replacement, preserving the native structures and biomechanics as much as possible.\n- Reduced chordal strains: Shorter length neochordae result in reduced strain in the neochord and surrounding chordal architecture, translating to reduce fatigue and increased durability of the repair\n- Low failure rates: Reduced strains directly result in reduced failure and increased durability.\n- PVAN is an entirely percutaneous and minimally invasive: Percutaneous approach facilitates a minimally invasive technique, which improves recovery times and reduces surgical complications.\n- Transcatheter delivery method: the invention leverages futuristic transcatheter approaches, which allows for wide adoption and clear avenues for robotic integration and manipulation.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers from Stanford University have developed an in vivo model of human neural development and disease. A key challenge in the study of human neurological diseases is the lack of animal models for the human brain and the scarcity of human brain tissue obtained for research. In recent years, organoids of human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells have provided an in vitro model to study brain development and disorders. While self-organized organoids can be generated that resemble different brain regions (such as human cortical organoids, (hCO)), the in vitro models lack the microenvironments or sensory inputs that are present in a living brain. Thus, in vitro organoids fail to provide an understanding of brain function, including neural circuits, behavioral outputs, and neuropsychiatric disease phenotypes. This technology successfully integrates human organoids into intact, living brains of developing rats to create an in vivo model of human neural development and function (Figure 1). The transplantation is performed several days after birth when the rat brains still have developmental plasticity. Early introduction enables the transplanted organoid (t-hCO) to anatomically and functionally integrate into the rat brain, creating working hybrid neural circuits. The resulting mature t-hCO neurons are able to respond to external sensory stimuli and can drive behavioral responses. The ability to transplant a broad spectrum of hiPS cell derived organoids offers this platform broad application to the study and therapeutic testing for many human neuropsychiatric disorders. Applications: Therapeutic testing for human neuropsychiatric disorders, Platform for human neural development research. Advantages: The technology enables the study of brain development and disease in a functional animal model, hCOs are transplanted into rats at an early, plastic developmental stage favoring functional and anatomical integration of the organoids, MRI monitoring allows for longitudinal studies, Transplantation of intact organoids (vs. single cell suspension) minimizes disruption to the human cells and enables formation of a human cortical neural cell unit within the rat brain.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed an active photonic metasurface with fast and high-resolution optical control for light modulation devices. Active photonic metasurfaces define and shape a light field by providing dynamic control over optical phase, amplitude, and polarization. While these devices have promise in expanding optical control beyond what is possible in devices with traditional optics, they require the fabrication of electrically active optical components which are smaller than the wavelength of light, a current challenge. This technology exploits surface acoustic waves (SAWs) to mechanically modulate insulating gaps between plasmonic nanoparticles and a metallic surface. By inducing small deformations in the insulating gap filler between the nanoparticles and the metallic surface, the optical scattering properties can be altered significantly. The use of acoustic waves enables force to be precisely sculpted across the surface with subwavelength (1 \u00b5m) spatial resolution and allows for control with GHz bandwidths. Taken together, the technology provides dynamic optical control for lightweight, compact, and high-efficiency light modulation devices.

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have developed a set of preclinical assays that are specifically designed to detect empathogenic effects of a drug that may indicate applications for that molecule in treating psychiatric diseases like PTSD. The potential for the drug MDMA to be used as an adjunct to psychotherapy for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder has recently been uncovered and the therapeutic is in Phase III clinical trials. MDMA's therapeutic mechanism derives from its ability to foster feelings of empathy, and there is no other drug in clinical use that known to have this effect. While this breakthrough promises great potential in helping psychiatric patients, MDMA also has significant abuse potential, cardiotoxicity and potential neurotoxicity. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify novel compounds with empathogenic effects and a more favorable side effect profile. Existing drug screening platforms for such drugs primarily rely on in vitro screens of receptor affinity, and preclinical behavioral assays which are not specific for prosocial or empathogen-like effects. Stanford scientists have developed a new screening methodology which involves both a novel set of behavioral assays that are specific for prosocial behaviors in mice, and a novel application of ex vivo brain imaging that detects patterns of brain circuit activation. The behavioral screening assays are a combination of the 3-chamber assay, social conditioned place preference assay, and the social transfer of pain assay. The brain imaging assay uses techniques adapted from human neuroimaging to detect drug and behavior-dependent expression of a gene that reflects neural activity. This suite of assays could identify novel empathogenic drugs, presenting a route to new potential breakthrough treatments for PTSD and other psychiatric disorders with more favorable side effect profiles. Stage of Development: Inventors have performed initial validation steps for the circuit mapping and are continuing to validate behavioral assays used to detect novel empathogens.

AAV vectors are recognized as the gene transfer vectors of choice for therapeutic application because they have the best safety and efficacy profile for the delivery of genes _in vivo_. However, they require high levels of transduction to be used in pancreatic cells (including the insulin-producing cells associated with diabetes). Furthermore, the vectors need to target the diseased cells specifically and efficiently. To address this problem, the inventors employed directed molecular evolution to generate and identify rAAV vectors with enhanced ability to transduce human islet cells. These AAV vectors with superior human pancreas transduction could require lower doses and fewer injections to achieve therapeutic relevance. They could be used for basic research into pancreatic cells function or in gene therapy to treat endocrine disorders, particularly type 1 or 2 diabetes.

The invention enables the use of gene-silencing approaches to prevent and treat viral infections. The invented method leverages use of a micro-vesicle called ARMMS, which is produced by direct outward budding of the plasma membrane in cells that produce arrestin-like cellular protein, ARRDC1 (PNAS:109,4146). ARRDC1 localizes to the plasma membrane and recruits another protein (TSG101) to the site, which in turn causes the plasma membrane to bud outward and form a micro-vesicle. RNAs that are physically attached to ARRDC1, are transferred into the vesicle along with ARRDC1. Following ARMMS release, they can fuse with plasma membranes of other cells and discharge their cargo directly into the cytoplasm of those cells, evading degradation by extracellular enzymes, and hence overcoming a major challenge in delivering RNA therapeutics. A fruitful application of the technology is prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Highly selective Beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists for treating asthma, COPD and other bronchoconstrictive disorders. Disease indication - Acute asthma, COPD, other bronchoconstrictive disorders (bronchial asthma, allergic asthma, intrinsic asthma, airway hyper-responsiveness, chronic bronchitis) with potential for treating heart failure. In particular, these molecules could be used in a rescue inhaler. Drug format - Small molecule (analogs of catecholamine type compounds such as isoprenaline, adrenaline and noradrenaline). Drug class - Improvement of existing class of bronchodilators. Research stage and Preliminary data - The inventors have validated the compounds in vitro, demonstrating 100-fold selectivity for the \u03b22-AR over the \u03b21-AR in a radioligand binding assay, and 1000-fold selectively for the \u03b22-AR over the \u03b21-AR in an arrestin recruitment assay. Target - Beta-2 adrenergic receptor (\u03b22-AR). Background - The adrenergic family of receptors are the primary points of action for the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. The receptors are divided into two subfamilies (\u03b1 and \u03b2) which differ in ligand specificity, expression in tissues, and downstream signaling. In particular, activating \u03b22-AR induces relaxation of airway smooth muscle. Thus, compounds that target \u03b22-AR have been used as bronchodilators to treat various respiratory diseases including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). In contrast, \u03b21-AR is highly expressed in the heart and activating this AR can lead to elevated blood pressure, exacerbate coronary artery disease and cause arrhythmias. Therefore, if \u03b2AR drugs are not selective, they activate \u03b21-AR along with \u03b22-AR, causing severe and unwanted side effects in asthma or COPD therapy. Mode of action - These compounds are analogs of adrenaline and noradrenaline which activate \u03b22-AR with high selectivity over \u03b21-AR. They are short-acting \u03b22-AR agonists that can dilate airways in the lungs. In addition, the \u03b22 selectivity, makes them potential candidates for treating heart failure. Competitive edge - These compounds could greatly reduce the risk of cardiovascular side effects (e.g., arrhythmia, elevated blood pressure) compared to traditional bronchodilators that target the \u03b22-AR. The molecules are 100 to 1000-fold selective for \u03b22-AR over \u03b21-AR whereas current therapies (e.g., salbutamol) are only 20-fold selective. In addition, the selective agonists are likely to be more effective than current therapies because they are full rather than partial agonists. Potential competitor - Current bronchodilator agents such as albuterol (Ventolin, Proventil etc.).",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a novel approach to make a stable and active platinum-alumina catalyst that maintains high activity under harsh conditions. Precious metal catalysts, such as platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd), are typically made in a form of small nanoparticles in order to create a large surface area for catalysis. However, these metal nanoparticles suffer from poor hydrothermal stability: under harsh conditions, the small nanoparticles grow into large crystallites with reduced surface area in a process called catalyst sintering and suffer loss of activity. Strategies to counter sintering often lead to activity-stability trade-offs. Stanford researchers describe a new process to make a stable and active platinum-alumina catalyst that maintains high activity under harsh conditions. The metal nanoparticles are encapsulated inside porous alumina using nanocasting and maintain their small size (~3.8 nm) after hydrothermal aging at 800 \u00baC. This material has superior stability compared to conventional catalysts and is the first metal-alumina system that maintains high activity under harsh hydrothermal conditions (oxygen, steam). The researchers also extended the encapsulation technique to palladium-platinum alloys that demonstrate even better stability, maintaining stability and activity after hydrothermal aging at 1100 \u00baC.

Tight fits are achieved by leveraging differing coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) between materials, particularly, the negative thermal expansion characteristics of [\u00b160] carbon laminates relative to the axis of a cylinder. The shape-optimized metallic grid with carbon interior and/or exterior skin offers superior ease and speed of assembly by heating and/or chilling without bolts, welds, or adhesives. Assembly of the joint is facilitated by the negative thermal expansion of the carbon skin in the circumferential direction with temperature modulation. Joints with external sleeves can be assembled using pre-chilled components that seal tightly when raised to ambient/operating temperature. Alternatively, joints with internal plugs can be assembled using pre-heated components that seal tightly when dropped to ambient/operating temperature. For heavily loaded structural applications, prestress can be used for assembly with no need for adhesives and the accompanying difficulty of non-destructive inspection of adhesive bonding in composite structures. Stainless steel is a good metallic grid choice for its toughness; fatigue and corrosion resistance; chemical compatibility with carbon composites; and ease in welding and metal removal by water jet.

Current 3D cell culture methods often use animal-derived proteins, which are xenogeneic and lack consistency across batches. In addition, enzymatic methods used to retrieve cells from the culture system can result in non-specific cleavage and downstream phenotypic effects. To address the current challenges, the Stanford group designed a new, fully chemically defined hydrogel system. Using small molecule modulators, the gelation and degradation properties of the hydrogel can be finely tuned. In short, the system consists of: a polymer with chemically reactive functional groups, a small molecule competitor, and a small molecule catalyst. The competitor allows for adequate mixing of the hydrogel to achieve homogenous cell distribution and can be used to modulate the material properties of the hydrogel. Depending on the timing, addition of the competitor can also disrupt the hydrogel network, which allows for easy cell retrieval. Addition of the catalyst serves to alter the crosslinking bond exchange rate, which mimics the cell's ability to remodel its extracellular environment in native tissue.

THP and papaverine are both medicinally important plant natural products (PNP), and they have experienced supply shortage especially in recent years due to COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional supply of PNP rely on slow plant growth stage and extraction of active pharmaceutical ingredient from the plants, and a more efficient and flexible supply chain is needed to meet the spikes in medical demands. The Stanford group resolved the current difficulties by engineering a yeast strain with heterologous expression of two enzyme variants that exhibit altered substrate specificity. Through protein engineering and activity optimization, the scientists tuned the target specificity and improved the overall yield rate of biosynthesized THP by 600-fold. They also designed an aqueous oxidation condition of biosynthesized THP to produce papaverine, increasing the yield of the equivalent reaction to 15%. The new fermentation-based production of clinically relevant PNP significantly increase the yield of THP and papaverine and alleviate the supply chain shortages. Applications: Manufacture of THP for downstream synthesis of atracurium or cisatracurium, Synthesis of papaverine for clinics and pharmaceuticals, General microbial fermentation methods for development of additional enzymes capable of biosynthesizing relevant natural products.

The tracking of blood-based molecules has the potential to generate rich mechanistic insight into diseases and identify novel biomarkers, but frequent collection and profiling is currently difficult because of the requirement for an in-clinic blood draw.

It uses only queries about the presence of alleles to make this decision using genome-wide SNP data. The technology could be extremely useful in forensics when allele frequencies in the mixture cannot be determined, or when individuals from different ethnicities may be present in the mixture. Currently, all existing methods to detect whether an individual is present in a DNA mixture require knowledge of allele frequencies. But this method detects individuals in a mixture without requiring allele frequencies. The invention allows robust identification of individuals from DNA mixtures (using SNP array data) for many populations in a frequency-independent way. Applications: In forensics, could be used to identify individuals (suspects/perpetrators) from a mixture of genomes. Advantages: Easy to use, only requires counting number of responses to allele presence queries. Does not require information about frequency of alleles. The thresholds required to make a confident detection are similar for many different populations. Can identify individuals even from a mixture of different populations. Can use external frequency information to improve the power of the method.",

Bustamante's lab have developed a phasing algorithm that incorporates sequencing read information, population and individual genotype data to provide more accurate haplotype reconstruction. Humans carry two copies of every chromosome in their genome: one from each parent.

Methods have been developed to phase unrelated individuals in the absence of parental information but these methods restrict themselves to genotype, population, or read data alone when reconstructing haplotypes and obtaining better performance has become quite challenging. This algorithm overcomes this limitation by incorporating sequence read information to reconstruct more accurate haplotypes from the genomes of related or unrelated individuals using population level genotype and/or haplotype data (when available).\n\n**Stage of Research**\nA comparative study has demonstrated that this approach yields significantly more accurate results over existing methods.

However, the high cost of oligonucleotide production necessitates advanced and cost-efficient techniques for genome synthesis. Current methods also utilize microbeads for genome assembly that result in unwanted byproducts and limited control of reagent contact. To circumvent these limitations, the Hesselink lab at Stanford invented a method that allows for the control of a single bead during assembly.\n\nThe inventors demonstrate the viability of controlled encapsulation and ejection of a single microbead into and out of a water microdroplet. The device integrates a microfluidic droplet generator with a suitably designed and aligned Indium Tin Oxide electrode structure to successfully manipulate microbeads within a microdroplet.

Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness globally, affects over 2.7 million individuals over 40 in the United States. Glaucoma comprises progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells. Degeneration of these nerves results in cupping, a characteristic appearance of the optic disc, and visual loss. Currently, glaucoma is treated by lowering intraocular pressure. However, this strategy is not always effective. Another possible way to treat glaucoma is by preventing neurodegeneration in glaucoma through neuroprotective HDAC4. HDAC4 is a Class II histone deacetylase (HDAC), a group of catalytic subunits of multiprotein complexes that alter chromatin structure and repress gene expression via binding to site-specific transcription factors. HDAC4 neuroprotection occurs in the nucleus and is mediated by preventing abortive cell cycle progression.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a tunable proximity assay with a wide dynamic range that can detect multiple analytes in a single sample. Blood-based quantification of protein biomarkers is a standard tool for the prediction, diagnosis, and monitoring of disease. Physiological concentrations of different plasma proteins can vary considerably, spanning over 10 orders of magnitude. Current methods rely upon sample splitting and differential dilutions, which are vulnerable to issues arising from non-linear dilutions (NLD). NLD describes the phenomenon wherein measured concentrations of a given analyte deviate greatly from their expected values when measured at different dilutions. The effects of NLD can be dramatic, and there is currently no single assay that can quantify both low- and high-abundance proteins simultaneously from a single sample. The inventors have developed a tunable proximity assay, EVROS, that can overcome the problems arising from NLD. The EVROS method is based on paired oligonucleotide-tagged affinity reagent detection of target analytes; when two detection reagents simultaneously bind to the same target molecule, barcoded DNA strands can undergo a ligation reaction in the presence of a complementary 'hybridization splint' DNA strand. Ligated and barcoded nucleic acids can be further amplified and detected by high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Importantly, EVROS introduces two independent tuning strategies to modulate the signal response curve of each analyte individually. First, a probe loading strategy ensures that similar signals are produced for all targets, regardless of abundance.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a massively parallel screening strategy to screen for target-responsive molecular switches. Target-responsive RNA- and DNA-based molecular switches have potential utility in a variety of technological applications. Such biosensors are typically based on aptamers that undergo a reversible structure-switching mechanism that is coupled to a detectable readout. Unfortunately, it remains a challenge to generate novel aptamer switches, because most aptamers assume a stably folded structure and do not undergo a binding-induced conformation change. Most approaches to engineer aptamer switches rely on rational design and require prior knowledge of aptamer structure. Such detailed structural characterization has only been achieved for a relatively small number of aptamers. Furthermore, even the most advanced modeling software fails to account for non-canonical base-pairing or can correctly predict three-dimensional folding, which can be critical for target recognition and binding. The inventors have developed a system for rapid and massively parallel screening of different switch scaffolds in a single experiment, circumventing the need for rational design. Building upon their recently developed non-natural aptamer array (N2A2) system, the method enables the synthesis and screening of an array of fluorophore-labeled anchored displacement strand (ADS) switch constructs directly onto the flow-cell of a modified Illumina MiSeq instrument. Target-responsive molecular switches are identified by sequential imaging of flow-cell with and without the target molecule, and signal from library members can be linked to their nucleotide sequence by the location of the signal. Imaging data from each ADS construct cluster reveals the presence of switches for which target binding results in increase (signal-on) or decreased (signal-off) fluorescence. This method thereby identifies nucleic acid sequences that are able to act as target-responsive molecular switches. The inventors demonstrate the power of their method in identifying novel molecular switch sequences with a well-characterized ATP aptamer, including several sequences with non-canonical base-pairing. This approach bypasses the time-consuming process of structural analysis, rational design, and optimization by screening nearly every possible 10-nucleotide switch domain sequence in a single assay. Applications include massively parallel screening of target-responsive nucleic acid-based molecular switches and screening strategy for converting aptamers to target-specific molecular switches. Advantages include the method could greatly accelerate the development of target-responsive molecular switches from existing aptamers without any a priori structural knowledge, by covering the full range of available sequence space for the switch domain, screen can rapidly identify promising aptamer switch constructs that would be otherwise overlooked in rational design approaches, screening methods validated with natural DNA-based aptamers and aptamers containing chemically modified bases, and methods do not need to start with a known aptamer sequence.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers from the Khuri-Yakub group have designed an improved, high spatial resolution ultrasonic neuromodulation device that implements chip waveform instead of continuous wave PIRF. Ultrasound neuromodulation using one or two transducers have been designed previously, but high pressure needs to be applied to achieve stronger modulation, causing tissue damage due to cavitation. The Khuri-Yakub group designed PIRF, which maximize radiation force by situating two transducers oppose from one another to generate a standing wave that can stimulate neural tissues with far less energy. However, this method still has limited spatial resolution, and the position of the target or the transducer need to be moved mechanically to modulate a different area. The group has therefore developed an improved PIRF system using a chirp waveform in which the frequency changes with time instead of a single waveform. Chirp excitation remarkably reduces the size of stimulation spot and allows for high spatial regulation. In addition, the modulation spot can be moved electronically rather than mechanically by correcting in proportion to time delays, which decrease the technical barriers associated with current neuromodulation methods. This new neuromodulation device can be readily implemented into current medical equipment as well as other fields where ultrasonic stimulation is required. Applications: Medical equipment for neuromodulation and nerve stimulation for various disorders such as Parkinson's, Tourette syndrome and epilepsy, Ultrasonic stimulation of other parts of the body where spatial resolution is required, Other fields where acoustic radiation force (ARF) is used (ex. particle manipulation, acoustic tweezers, etc), Implementation of PIRF with chirp waveform into general focused transducers. Advantages: Greater radiation force with the same acoustic pressure, Reduced damage caused by heat and cavitation from pressure, Reduced stimulation spot size with chirp waveform, Improved spatial resolution with chirp waveform compared to the previous generation PIRF, Precise movement of modulation spot inside the body electrically, Easy implementation into existing transducers by changing the input signal to chirp waveform.",

CF is a debilitating disease that results in early death and high morbidity. Improved therapies for CF and other lung disorders remain a tremendous unmet clinical need.

Stanford researchers have developed LISA, which passes a sequence of learned ciphers (skills) to the agent instead of natural language instructions.

LISA enables users to use plain English to perform complex long-horizon tasks. This novel method outperforms prior methods to complete long-range instructions with double the effectiveness. Moreover, this learned language protocol makes the behavior of a robot very interpretable, which makes it highly desirable in settings like robotic surgery, autonomous vehicles, construction robots, and other safety-critical areas.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a frequency-selective MHz power amplifier for generating dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Commercial applications include plasma-assisted nitrogen fixation for fertilizer production. An alternative to the conventional Haber-Bosch process for generating ammonia, plasma-assisted nitrogen fixation using DBD is able to achieve much cleaner and decentralized fertilizer production at atmospheric pressure without generating greenhouse gases. The Stanford team's newly designed, frequency-selected Class E power amplifier is able to drive such DBD plasma loads at 10s of MHz frequencies. Due to the thermal limitations of the DBD electrodes, delivering power to one of the loads at an alternating manner allows better utilization of the power amplifier. Other advantages include greater efficiency and a more compact design compared to most commercial power amplifiers currently used in the plasma generation industry.\n\nThe designed power amplifier is able to output 600 W at frequencies of 12.4 MHz and 15.5 MHz with a peak efficiency of 91.5%. Testing with the designed DBD electrodes demonstrates its ability to directly drive the plasma loads.\n\nApplications:\n- Plasma-assisted nitrogen fixation for fertilizer production\n- Wireless power transfer\n- Biomedical (e.g., dielectrophoresis \u2013 widely applied towards the selective transport, separation and characterization of biosystems)\n\nAdvantages:\n- More efficient and compact than most commercial power amplifiers used in the plasma generation industries\n- Supports smaller system size and more environmentally friendly fertilizer production than Haber-Bosch process\n- Plasma-assisted nitrogen fixation works under atmospheric conditions without emission of greenhouse gases\n- Localized production due to the reduced system size also eliminates potential cost and hazards during transportation\n- Allows efficient power delivery to the selected loads at multiple switching frequencies",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers developed a novel bioprinting platform for fabricating human assembloids with spatial control of organoid fusion. Researchers use model systems to study important spatiotemporally controlled cellular interactions which occur throughout human development and are otherwise inaccessible. While current in vivo systems have provided insights into numerous diseases, translating these findings into the clinic has underdelivered due to key developmental differences between conventional in vivo model systems and humans. On the other hand, in vitro model systems remain limited and do not recapitulate human development and disease satisfactorily. In an effort to better recreate aspects of development and disease in a dish, organoids, three-dimensional clusters of organ-specific cells with organ-appropriate physiologies, have recently been fused together to form assembloids. Assembloids have been shown to better emulate various tissues, including the brain, gastrointestinal tract, liver, pancreas, and retina. Unfortunately, although assembloids allow temporal control of organoid interactions, spatial control of their fusion is currently challenging, which limits their utility as a high throughput in vitro model. Stanford inventors, therefore, developed a novel bioprinting platform for fabricating human assembloids with spatial control of organoid fusion. The platform consists of an iron-oxide particle-laden hydrogel and electromagnetic 3D printer to mediate the fusion of human stem cell-derived organoids or spheroids derived from any cell type or source. Applications include creating assembloid-based in vitro models to study normal tissue function and development, and creating assembloids-based in vitro models for various diseases including cirrhosis of the liver and neurodevelopmental disorders. Advantages of the method include allowing the user to control the positioning of multiple spheroids or organoids in three dimensions with high spatial fidelity, not damaging or deforming the constitutive spheroid or organoid building blocks throughout the printing process, being automated and highly reproducible, and being seamlessly replicated across any number of experiments, printers, or laboratories.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers developed a new technology that prints networks with distinct branch structures that emulate the natural branching observed in in vivo vascular networks. Perfusion must be achieved when forming three-dimensional (3D) multicellular structures for tissue engineering, 3D in vitro models of organ development and disease, or fundamental studies of cell behavior, among others. The need for perfusion is exemplified through the vasculature in the body and the need for vascular-like structures in large 3D cell structures. While the process of angiogenesis is currently understood, the technology needed to fabricate components of a functional vascular network like multi-scale, branched structures (e.g., bifurcations and trifurcations) and the increasing and decreasing diameters of vessels naturally found in vivo, is lacking. Similar fabrication challenges apply to multiple tissues throughout the body, including lymphatics, airways, and the gastrointestinal tract. Stanford researchers successfully fabricated perfusable tissue structures using a new strategy called Gelation of Uniform Interfacial Diffusant in Embedded 3D Printing (GUIDE-3DP), which overcomes some of the challenges above. Embedded 3D printing involves the fabrication of desired structures within a support material, reducing deformation due to gravity and enabling the printing of complex structures. The novel GUIDE-3DP method builds upon this approach by incorporating an interfacial diffusant strategy to rapidly fabricate perfusable networks of interconnected channels with precise control over the branching geometry and vessel diameters. Applications include fabrication of in vitro 3D cell culture constructs, e.g drug screening platforms, or fluidic connections between existing lab-on-a-chip devices; fabrication of implantable medical devices that require a branched, tubular structure such as vascular grafts or nerve guidance conduits, both of which are currently limited to simple cylindrical structures; and fabrication of other networks with distinct branch structures that emulate the natural branching observed in vascular networks in vivo. Advantages include enabling the printing of complex networks with seamless junctions at branch points with user-defined geometry, compatibility with existing photocrosslinkable bio-inks as well as novel bio-inks synthesized from recombinant proteins for cell-type customization, and allowing the printing of vessel structures with different, user-specified luminal diameters within the same network.",

    "ip_description": "Prematurity is the single largest cause of death in children under 5 years of age, both in low-and high-income countries. The heterogenous nature of neonatal morbidities that account for poor long-term outcomes, and lack of predictive models, has prevented precision-medicine approaches that are needed for reducing the impact of this global challenge. Researchers at Stanford have developed a method for quantitative assessment of neonatal health using dried blood spot metabolite profiles and deep learning. Prematurity is associated with significant newborn health risks, including intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Current diagnosis and treatment of the latter three conditions are reactive to the occurrence and onset of typical symptoms. Moreover, current classification methods for preterm birth (gestational age and birthweight) can vary widely with regard to adverse health outcomes and thus of limited value for risk stratification. To create a more comprehensive approach, the Stanford team linked quantitative metabolite results from routine newborn screening (NBS) dried blood spots representing over 40,000 livebirths to clinical outcomes. Using deep learning, NBS metabolites were condensed into a metabolic health index predicting the likelihood of suffering from the four adverse neonatal outcomes described above. Their results show that premature newborns can be risk stratified on the basis of metabolic vulnerability through deep learning approaches. Further development of the metabolic and algorithmic definition of preterm risk has the potential to improve treatment decisions in the most vulnerable neonatal patients. Future work will focus on performance improvements and validation of algorithmic risk stratification using other available NBS metabolite values. Applications include algorithmic assessment of neonatal health. Advantages include creating a biological basis for comprehensive newborn risk assessment should improve risk quantification and disease diagnosis, enables early stratification to appropriate care pathways, and an NBS-based metabolic taxonomy of prematurity has widespread translational potential as NBS metabolite values are collected as a part of routine neonatal screening in hospitals throughout North America.",

Their solution addresses the need for a low-power optical coherent receiver to accommodate next-generation multi-wavelength data center links.

As data center systems are power- and cost-constrained, the receiver in question only uses analog components to reduce power consumption.

Today, polarization manipulation across multiple wavelengths is a critical task for many applications such as ellipsometry or pulsed laser systems. However, there is no method for dynamically tuning the polarization state of light across a large bandwidth.

    "ip_description": "Researchers in the Roncarolo lab have discovered transcription factors that enable the tracking and differentiation of type 1 T regulatory (Tr1) cells for the treatment of autoimmune conditions. Type 1 regulatory (Tr1) cells are a subset of T regulatory cells that have been shown in clinical trials to successfully treat graft versus host disease, with the potential to treat other autoimmune diseases as well. Unlike other T regulatory cells, they are not governed by FOXP3 master control and their transcriptional machinery is ill-defined, making it challenging to engineer or induce cells that exhibit their antigen-specific tolerogenic behavior. Researchers in the Roncarolo lab have discovered key transcription factors that govern the Tr1 cell phenotype via RNA-seq transcriptome analysis. They have proposed a method to utilize these factors to more readily induce Tr1 cell differentiation _in vivo_ or _in vitro_ from CD4+ T cells or iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells). While other methods have been described to produce these cells, they are difficult to execute, requiring the coordinated collection of donor CD4+ T cells and recipient monocytes and/or tedious clonal expansion from single cells. This invention simplifies this process, requiring just a single collection of blood and making Tr1 production more robust and scalable for therapeutic use. Applications include production of Tr1 cells from CD4+ T cells or iPSCs for cell therapy to treat autoimmune conditions, use of transcription factors to identify, quantify, and track Tr1 cells _in vivo_, and development of small molecule agents to induce Tr1 differentiation _in vitro_ or _in vivo_.

Cell therapies utilize engineered cells to achieve specific effects in a patient's body. However, those desired therapeutic phenotypes are usually regulated by multiple genes in the human body, and current technologies, which act on a single genetic pathway, cannot program such polygenic behaviors into cells. To get around this issue, we need to identify combinations of genetic and pharmacological interventions that achieve the desired polygenic therapeutic function. However, identifying the desired combination of genes and programming cells with these complex phenotypes at scale is intractable and requires a scalable platform for engineering cells with complex phenotypes. Stanford researchers, therefore, developed a novel technology that provides a data-driven solution to the combinatorial scaling problem of polygenic phenotypes. The technology leverages recent advances in machine learning, modern genome editing, and high-throughput single-cell phenotyping to construct genetic perturbation libraries for which different phenotype combinations can be extracted from each cell. Therefore, new polygenic cell therapies can be designed through an efficient, data-directed exploration of high-dimensional combinatorial perturbations.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a widely used treatment modality for the management of respiratory failure in intensive care units (ICU). An estimated 300,000 patients undergo MV annually in the U.S. In these patients, timely extubation promotes improved health outcomes and minimizes the risk of important complications such as pneumonia, delirium, gastrointestinal bleeding, and death. Progressive and dramatic diaphragm weakness and atrophy can result from MV, called ventilator induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD), beginning after as little as 2 days of MV. VIDD is characterized by the early reduction in the ability of the diaphragm to generate force in the absence of atrophy, and later development of frank diaphragm muscle fiber atrophy. It has also been established that VIDD is an important driver of failure to wean patients from MV.\n\nPrevention of VIDD is likely to reduce ICU stay, complications, and mortality in ventilated patients. The Shrager lab has demonstrated that components of the TGF-beta pathway, specifically Smad3, are critical to the development of VIDD in rats. Use of a Smad3 inhibitor prevented VIDD in rats in a published study. The inventors hypothesized that administering Vactosertib to patients undergoing MV would disrupt diaphragm dysfunction and atrophy and thereby promote timely extubation. The novel treatment method would likely decrease ventilator days and resultant complications and deaths stemming from intubation and MV. It would have the potential to become a drug widely used in the management of ICU patients requiring MV.

    "ip_name": "Acute and Chronic Pain Suppression through Targeted Peripheral Nerve Application of Focused Ultrasound",
    "ip_number": "S17-430",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a method for targeted application of focused ultrasound to peripheral nerves to suppress acute pain. The prevalence of acute pain is high across multiple healthcare settings, including inpatient wards, emergency departments, and postoperative units. Acute pain from any injury is frequently inadequately managed; yet, poorly controlled acute pain is associated with significant morbidity. Moderate-severe acute pain is associated with increased risk of developing myocardial ischemia, impaired pulmonary function, ileus, thromboembolism, impaired immune function, infection, and anxiety. In the US, 100 million patients undergo inpatient and outpatient surgery each year. The vast majority of patients experience pain after surgery, and up to 75% of patients will have moderate-severe pain on the day of surgery. Of the 100 million emergency department (ED) visits in the U.S. each year, acute pain is also one of the most common complaints. Two out of three of ED patients with pain report it as moderate-severe, and yet, only half experience adequate pain relief. Among inpatient adults, up to 80% experience pain and 40% experience severe pain during their hospitalization. Extremity injuries (trauma and surgical) are common reasons for presentation to emergency department and for surgical intervention, and are associated with a high incidence of moderate-to-severe pain, prolonged opioid use, and chronic pain. Acute pain after surgery and trauma typically improves markedly within 2 weeks, but mild-moderate pain often persists for many weeks. Current acute pain treatment approaches generally fall into two broad categories: systemic pain medications (often opioids) and neuromodulating techniques, such as peripheral nerve blockade (PNB) with local anesthetics. Opioids remain among the most commonly used medications for acute pain management; in fact, 40-50% of all inpatients receive opioids during hospitalization. However, opioids are associated with a myriad of adverse outcomes, both short- and long-term. Short-term adverse effects of opioids include respiratory depression, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, and ileus, which worsen patient outcomes and increase patient care costs. Long-term negative effects of acute opioid administration include prolonged opioid use, high-risk opioid use, and the CP development. Further, chronic opioid use after traumatic injury, surgery, and hospitalization is frequent. Long-term opioid use is also associated with an increased risk of developing a large number of negative outcomes, including immunologic and hormonal dysfunction, neurocognitive deficits, hyperalgesia, suicide, and death. Additionally, opioids preferentially inhibit C-fibers over A-delta fibers and thus are better at controlling dull, burning, or rest pain, but not sharp or movement pain. Yet, despite not adequately managing pain, opioids are still widely utilized for acute pain therapy. In fact, more than 70% of surgical patients fill an opioid prescription after surgery, and more than 50% of trauma patients receive an opioid prescription upon discharge. While peripheral nerve blockade (PNB) decreases acute pain in many settings, peripheral nerve blocks have important limitations which have led to their under-utilization in trauma and surgical settings. While only inhibition of pain fibers (A-delta and C fibers) is needed, local anesthetics also block motor (A-alpha) fibers and non-pain sensory (A-beta) fibers, which may increase the risk of patient injury from falls and prevent early participation in physical therapy. Further, while the use of diagnostic ultrasound to find peripheral nerves is straightforward, PNBs can be technically difficult due to the challenges of perineural needle placement. Thus, anesthesiologists' PNB training is complex with expanding requirements for subspecialty training. Additionally, the time required for PNBs is often negatively perceived by surgeons and healthcare providers due to the risk of delays. Single-shot PNBs (single injection of local anesthetic) are short-lived (24 hours) and may result in rebound pain after cessation. Continuous PNBs (a percutaneous indwelling catheter is inserted with the tip next to a nerve for continuous or intermittent local anesthetic infusion) typically last 3-5 days, but require significant clinical follow-up for the provider/patient, and an increasing risk of catheter infection with a greater duration. Additionally, local anesthetic systemic toxicity, with a mortality rate of 10%, is a risk when local anesthetics are injected during PNB. Pain after trauma and surgeries commonly is moderate-to-severe for 1-2 weeks after the injury and surgery. The vast majority of patients have poorly controlled acute pain during this period, which worsens patient outcomes. Ultrasonography was developed in the 1940s to image tissue transcutaneously; diagnostic ultrasound energy delivery to imaged tissues is low. Ultrasound waves pass through human soft tissues with known attenuation factors for each tissue, enabling transcutaneous, (noninvasive) application to both superficial and deep tissues. Similarly to light waves, ultrasound waves can be focused to areas of varying size (relatively easily from 1mm to several mm in diameter) by using a concave transducer, delivering energy noninvasively to a target tissue, and having minimal impact on surrounding tissues. This focused ultrasound (FUS) can be used to deliver 4-6 orders of magnitude greater energy to tissues then is delivered by imaging ultrasound; depending on the FUS parameters used, the energy is transferred to tissue as thermal and mechanical energy. With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guidance, high intensity FUS is used clinically as a noninvasive technique to safely ablate tissue, e.g., prostate cancer and uterine fibroids. Lower intensity FUS can be used for clinical purposes, non-permanently altering tissues. Currently, FUS is widely investigated for its potential in modulating the central nervous system, specifically to treat diseases such as essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, neuropathic pain, and depression. Advantages of FUS for transcranial neuromodulation include the ability to noninvasively target deep brain regions, its ability to be directed at very specific and small areas of the brain, and its lack of ionizing radiation. There is increasing evidence that FUS may be an optimal tool for treating peripheral pain conditions. Prior investigations have also studied the effect of FUS on the peripheral nervous system (PNS), finding dose-dependent reversible or permanent reduction in peripheral nerve action potential (AP) amplitudes across different ex vivo and in vivo animal models. Investigators have postulated that FUS may be used to manage some pain conditions, and animal studies suggest further potential for this purpose. However, published investigations into FUS's utility for acute pain management are lacking from the scientific literature. Injected liposomal bupivacaine, for PNB and local infiltration at the surgical site, was developed to provide extended duration pain management. However, a recent meta-analysis concluded that liposomal bupivacaine does not significantly extend pain relief compared to non-liposomal bupivacaine. ATX-101, a phase II investigational sustained release local anesthetic-polymer, has also been proposed as an adjustable duration for local infiltration and peripheral nerve blockade. However, injection of local anesthetics is invasive and requires a high level of training to safely guide a needle to a peripheral nerve. Additionally, local anesthetics are direct neurotoxins, and exposure of peripheral nerves to local anesthetics beyond 48-72 hours results in increasing nerve injury (although without known clinically-relevant adverse effects). The Anderson lab has investigated FUS's potential for acute pain suppression and found that using a distinct set of parameters, FUS 1) preferentially inhibits pain fibers over motor fibers and 2) blocks acute pain for 1-2 weeks after injury. FUS appears to be a promising modality for reversibly inhibiting peripheral nociceptive fibers without the need for systemic, addicting pharmacologic agents (i.e., opioids). FUS has the benefits of regional anesthesia and 1) is noninvasive, obviating the risk of infection; 2) eliminates the need for local anesthetics which inhibit motor fibers and have potential for systemic toxicity; 3) differentially inhibits nociceptive fibers over motor fibers, thus is unlikely to reduce PT participation or increase the risk of falls; 4) would require significantly less training and post-procedural care to utilize than regional anesthesia; 5) potentially could be employed as early in the chain of care as the battlefield triage station; and 6) may decrease the risk of developing chronic pain after trauma, and thus, reducing CP-associated morbidities (i.e. substance use disorder).",

Acting synergistically, this architecture achieves high selectivity and conversion efficiency for partial oxidation of methane to form methanol and other oxygenates at room temperature. Direct conversion of methane to methanol and other partial oxidation products is one of the most scientifically challenging problems in chemistry that, if solved, has significant implications for the clean energy economy. With millions of tons of methane being wasted through venting and flaring, its conversion to valuable chemicals and liquid fuels and its ability to displace carbon-rich fuels such as coal, jet fuel, diesel and gasoline could substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, methane's high C-H bond strength, negligible electron affinity and low polarizability pose a high activation barrier. In addition, partially oxygenated products such as methanol and formaldehyde are more reactive than methane and thus are prone to over-oxidation to CO2. Consequently, direct methane to methanol conversion is often faced with a trade-off between CH4 conversion efficiency and methanol selectivity.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers have developed a device that combines one-photon and two-photon microscopy using fast temporal multiplexing enabling 3D alignment between in vivo and ex vivo data for neuroscience and spatial biology applications. High-resolution, three-dimensional fluorescence imaging promises rich information about biological function and structure with applications ranging from neuroscience to oncology to spatial genomics. While nonlinear multiphoton microscopy provides the resolution and depth information to produce 3D images of tissues at single-cell resolution, but it has a limited field of view, slow acquisition times, and must be performed in a controlled laboratory setting not compatible with many in vivo and functional imaging studies. On the other hand, one-photon fluorescence imaging can be used for in vivo imaging due to its portability and large field of view, but it produces a low resolution, low depth-of-field image only. The invented device aligns one-photon imaging with multi-photon ex vivo images at the cellular level to obtain three-dimensional data at single-cell resolution during in vivo functional studies. The inventors demonstrate its utility in neuroscience applications by imaging functional neural ensembles in mice to determine neuron identity, the morphology of neurons, and fidelity of the time traces of genetically encoded calcium indicators expressed in these neurons. This technology will find use in functional neuroscience imaging such as this but also has applications in spatial biology, including spatial proteomics and transcriptomics. Applications: Alignment of widefield functional in vivo imaging and three-dimensional, single-cell resolution ex vivo imaging with applications in: Functional neuroscience studies, Tumor cell mapping, Multi-omics spatial imaging. Advantages: Enables high-resolution 3D fluorescence imaging in settings where precise 3D microscopy is usually not possible (e.g., hospitals, live animals, patient's home), Combines advantages from both one-photon and two-photon imaging techniques, High-contrast, High-resolution, High signal-to-noise, Deep tissue penetration, Large field-of-view.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford scientists have developed a safe, minimally invasive catheter system that delivers acoustic energy to urethral stones and disintegrates them to treat renal colic. Stones in the urinary system are painful and, in some cases, cause systemic infections. Additionally, renal stones can travel down the ureter towards the bladder and obstruct the path for urine. Renal obstruction can result in renal colic, ureteral stricture, and tissue damage. Renal stones are a common reason for hospital visits. Patients are often not treated immediately since doctors advise that they wait three to four weeks to allow the stone to pass naturally. During this time, patients rely on over-the-counter or opioid pain medication. If stones don't pass naturally or patients develop severe pain, infection, or hydronephrosis, they undergo relatively invasive procedures that cause ureteral trauma, requiring further medical procedures. Stanford scientists developed the current technology to solve the drawbacks of the current gold standards of treatment. Their invention provides safe, minimally invasive, and effective catheter systems that utilize acoustic energy to dust renal stones without causing further trauma to the renal system. Applications: Removal of kidney stones in renal colic patients. Advantages: Minimally invasive intracorporeal approach, Can be used outside of the hospital, Does not require anesthesia, Efficiently removes kidney stones. So far, treatment with the device leaves the patient for 30 days, Equivalent to or greater than the current gold standard, Prevents damage to the inner lining of the ureter and removes the need for post-procedural ureteral stent placement.",

CD81 inhibits cancer cell invasion and modulates host adaptive and innate immune responses against cancer, such as regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Stanford innovators therefore developed a unique anti-CD81 monoclonal antibody, dubbed 5A6, with specific biological properties compared to other anti-CD81 monoclonal antibodies. 5A6 stops the spreading of solid human tumors and B-cell lymphomas in xenograft models. 5A6 works independently from the tumor histotype; its clinical development could therefore be envisioned across cancers. Applications: Neo-adjuvant or adjuvant systemic therapy of localized solid tumors to prevent tumor metastasis, Systemic consolidation therapy after standard of care for metastatic cancers to prevent subsequent relapses, Systemic therapy of anti-CD20 refractory B-cell lymphomas, Loco-regional therapy of neoplastic lesions to avoid metastasis spreading (e.g intravesical therapy of urothelial carcinomas, topical therapy for skin metastasis of triple negative breast cancers,\u2026).

Cell-based therapeutic approaches using hiPSC-CMs, such as the injection of these cells or the transplantation of engineered cardiac tissue, show promise in repairing damage and improving cardiac function characteristic of many heart diseases. These approaches are limited because they require billions of CMs, a process that is technically challenging and incredibly resource intensive.

Co-treatment with a small molecule mitogen combined with the pharmacological inhibition of cell-cell contact restores the regenerative capacity of hiPSC-CMs while maintaining the functional integrity of CMs. In addition to overcoming a technical barrier for therapeutic development, the ability to massively expand CMs _in vitro_ enables researchers to address previously unanswered questions in regenerative biology, cardiac disease, and drug discovery using a highly pure and patient specific model.\n\nApplications:\n- Cell therapy for cardiomyopathy or congenital heart defects\n- Cardiac regeneration therapy or transplantation\n- _In vitro_ disease modeling\n- High throughput drug toxicity and efficacy screening\n- Patient-specific engineered heart tissue\n- 3D tissue generation\n\nAdvantages:\n- Targeted expansion of CMs generates large numbers of pure CMs previously unobtainable _in vitro_\n- Bypasses need to start differentiation process with large amounts of iPSCs\n- CMs retain contractile, electrophysiological, and cellular characteristics\n- Robust protocol works across multiple cell lines with no observable differences from genetic background showing potential for patient-specific CM expansion\n- Can be expanded right away or following cryopreservation\n- Proliferating cells can be rapidly matured\n- Decreased labor and time",

This Stanford innovation addresses a newly identified form of optical crosstalk, unique to image sensors with patterned thin-film filters.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers developed a programmable tuning circuit for dynamic, all-electronic tuning of the resonance frequency, sensitivity, and bandwidth of ultrasound transducers. Typically, ultrasonic sensing systems follow one of two design philosophies: using conventional transducers for general purpose use across broad application spaces, or fabricating custom transducers using novel materials, architectures, and transduction mechanisms that optimize for a specific application. The former approach suffers from sub-optimal performance, while the latter typically employs complex designs that require high fabrication time, effort, and cost. Moreover, with either of these approaches the operating frequency is fixed by geometric design decisions and scaling the system to incorporate large transducer arrays is particularly challenging due to inevitable process variations when using MEMS devices. Aside from the above challenges, all resonant transducers also have an inherent tradeoff between sensitivity and bandwidth, wherein one can either achieve high sensitivity or wide bandwidth but not both simultaneously. To address these problems, Stanford researchers have developed a method that shifts complexity from custom transducer/MEMS fabrication to intelligent electronics instead, increasing system performance by overcoming the sensitivity-bandwidth limit and allowing for robust, reconfigurable, and cost-effective system scaling. This is accomplished through two all-electronic tuning circuits: 1) a tunable negative capacitance that can be utilized to shift the transducer to a desired resonance frequency while canceling any parasitic capacitance to maintain high sensitivity and combat process variations and 2) a tunable resistance that electronically dampens transducer resonance and increases bandwidth at the desired resonance frequency. Together, they provide an exclusively electronic means for tuning the transducer's resonance frequency, sensitivity, and bandwidth on the fly depending upon application requirements. Thus, with the proposed solution, one could use conventional, easy-to-fabricate transducers while employing the electronic tuning knobs to enable high-performance, yet highly reconfigurable ultrasonic sensing systems for a variety of applications ranging from medical ultrasound, non-destructive testing, and air-coupled sensing. Applications include time-of-flight based applications like ultrasound localization, ranging, and distance estimation, medical ultrasound, non-destructive testing, non-contact 1D, 2D and 3D ultrasound sensing and imaging in air, and cross-medium imaging such as airborne sonar imaging (water-to-air), underground mapping (soil-to-air), and medical imaging (tissue-to-air).

This machine-learning guided procedure is not limited to just finding wear-resistant multiple principal element alloys (MPEAs), but can be readily applied to searching the vast processing-composition MPEA combinatorial for other desired materials. Applications include hard surface coating on commercial products such as cutting surfaces (e.g. knives to machine tools) and contact surfaces (e.g. electrical connectors and brushes in electrical motors). The coating can be applied to any hard product to reduce wear and tear. Advantages include being inexpensive (made with low cost materials, FeNbB), non-toxic, earth-friendly materials, high wear resistance (4x harder and nearly 2x more wear-resistant than stainless steel), room temperature processable, prolongs life of product due to less degradation from wear and tear, and demonstrates how application of machine-learning-guided high throughput experimentation can improve on best-known materials and quickly lead to superior ones in highly complex composition-processing spaces.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers developed a device that emits electromagnetic radiation that oscillates between at least first and second distinct polarization states. Photobiomodulation (PBM) (also known as light therapy) has been used as a treatment modality for diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), insomnia, ADHD and dementia, and has been shown to be effective in improving patient recovery after surgical procedures. Many PBM devices utilize light sources that flicker at particular frequencies (that is, they oscillate between an on and off state at that frequency). For example, light sources that flicker at 40 Hz have shown particular promise in treating AD. A few PBM devices also utilize polarized light sources, and evidence exists that polarized light is superior to randomly polarized light sources in some applications (such as, for example, improved wound healing and accelerated recovery from protracted illness). This invention combines the benefits of a polarized light source with those of an oscillating light source. Moreover, since the device utilizes multiple polarization states, it can be used to address effects that are specific to each selected polarization state (e.g., due to stereospecific absorption). Moreover, because the device is in an 'always on' state (because oscillation occurs between two different polarization states, rather than between on and off states), the device may significantly shorten the duration of time-dependent treatments that are not polarization-specific. Finally, because the device is in an 'always on' state and oscillations in polarization states are not readily discernible to the human eye, the device overcomes the discomfort and deleterious effects sometimes associated with visible flicker.\n\nStage of Development\nProof of concept in in mouse models\n\nApplications\n\n* Light therapy for treatment of various diseases, such as Alzheimer's, insomnia, ADHD, dementia\n\nAdvantages\n\n* Provides all of the benefits of conventional PBM devices and polarized light sources\n* Provides benefits unique to certain polarizations of light\n* Shortens treatment times\n* Overcomes issues with visible flicker",

By directly editing neuronal stem cells (NSCs), we can create a cell-based therapy that can deliver therapeutic proteins into the CNS in a precise fashion. This occurs by using cells that have the biologic property of turning into multiple CNS cell types and migrating to broad areas of the CNS. The unique and transformative method can be used to treat a variety of both rare and common diseases.\n\nThe Porteus Lab at Stanford has developed a completely novel therapeutic method of delivering precise proteins to the CNS. Human NSCs are modified by delivering an engineered nuclease and a donor DNA fragment by electroporation to primary neuronal stem cells. After homologous recombination, the NSCs will have a transgene precisely and permanently inserted into a specific genomic location where it will be expressed in a sustained and regular fashion. The genetically modified NSCs can be purified and transplanted into the CNS where they will differentiate into different CNS lineages thus giving rise to cells in the CNS that express the transgene. Current enzyme replacement therapy does not deliver proteins to the CNS because of the blood-brain barrier. This is the first invention using gene editing in primary human NSCs and can be used to create cells that can be administered to a patient to treat a disease.\n\nApplications:\n- Treatments for the CNS and Neurological diseases\n- Drug delivery\n- Gene editing\n\nAdvantages:\n- Safely modified NSCs for transplantation\n- Stable long-term transgene expression not found using other mechanisms of genetic modification\n- First invention using gene editing in primary human NSCs",

As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic illustrates, during viral outbreaks there is an urgent need for diagnostic and prognostic tests to distinguish high-risk patients from those with mild infection who can recover at home. The researchers integrated 4,780 blood transcriptome profiles from patients infected with one of 16 viruses across 34 independent cohorts from 18 countries, and 289 scRNA-seq profiles of 702,970 immune cells across three independent cohorts. They identified four gene modules that distinguished non-severe from severe viral infection with clinically useful accuracy. Existing lab tests (e.g., white blood cell count differentials) and standardized severity of illness scores have limited clinical utility in a triage setting during viral outbreaks. The researchers have previously described a conserved host response to respiratory viral infections, called the Meta-Virus Signature (MVS). They hypothesized that it could be used to better distinguish patients with mild versus severe infection, irrespective of the virus. Here it identifies distinct clusters of patients with non-severe and severe viral infection. The researchers have identified a set of genes in human blood that accurately predict severe outcome in patients with viral infection, with analysis ongoing. Applications include integration in point-of-care tests to provide answers in as little as 30 minutes, and usefulness during pandemic and non-pandemic times (e.g., influenza season).

The funnel shaped device with a cantilevered edge on the proximal end fits a wide range of graft or aorta sizes without distortion and is secured to the distal end of a graft or the aorta without slippage or fluid leakage. Two standard luer lock ports provide clear fluid injection (pressurization) and de-airing for a clear view. With continued clear fluid injection, the surgeon can clearly assess the aortic valve under physiologic pressure via the transparent top. Given the reversible attachment mechanism, this device enables surgeons to assess aortic morphology, cusp symmetry, and coaptation before and after aortic valve repair in an iterative process without the need to come off bypass (See video.)\n\nPost aortic valve repair, surgeons often test valve competency via saline injection test, which provides inadequate pressurization. Graft clamping test only provides subjective information and does not allow a direct view of the valve. Transesophageal echocardiogram evaluation remains the primary mode of intraoperative assessment of the aortic valve, but the results are highly operator dependent and also do not provide direct visualization of the aortic valve. If the repair is unsuccessful deemed by echocardiogram, the surgeon would have to re-cross clamp, re-arrest the heart, and re-repair the aortic valve, all of which can significantly increase intraoperative and postoperative risk, such as stroke and heart attack.\n\nThe Woo Lab device mimics the physiologic pressure that the aortic valve experiences in diastole, allows surgeons to visually inspect the valve before aortic closure and complete any additional repairs without re-arresting the heart, and thereby provides a safer and more effective outcome than current techniques.\n\n**Stage of Development**\nResearchers in the Woo Lab at Stanford Medicine has completed a preliminary first in man testing, demonstrating safety and efficacy of the device.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   **Cardiothoracic surgery** - aortic valve testing\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   **Safer and more effective** than current techniques\n\n*   **Surgeon can directly inspect valve competency and repair success** without an echocardiogram, potentially reducing surgery time and reducing the need to re-cross clamp and re-repair aortic valves.\n*   **Provides physiologic pressure for aortic valve competency test** without clamps, which block the surgeon's view to the aortic valves\n*   **Decreases intraoperative risk and risk of postoperative complications,** such as stroke and heart attack.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers in the Multi-Robot Systems Lab have developed a software model for predicting risk-aware human behavior in multi-agent traffic scenarios that include a range of human driver behavior from aggressive (speeding, overtaking, sudden zigzagging, and lane-changes) to conservative (driving slowly and conforming to the right-most lane). Existing autonomous driving approaches plan conservatively and forgo game-theoretic reasoning. In contrast, the human driver behavior model, CMetric, maps drivers' entropic risk preferences. The game-theoretic risk-sensitive planner uses the risk preference to model risk-aware interactions among human drivers and an autonomous vehicle in various traffic scenarios. (See Figure 1.) This planner recognizes aggressive human drivers and yields to them while maintaining a greater distance from them. The CMetric integrated planner systematically includes uncertainty, leads to safer navigation, and leverages the autonomous vehicles' influence on other cars to achieve safe and efficient driving.\n\n**Figure 1**: (top) The aggressive human agent (blue) with the ego-vehicle as a conservative agent (red).

Record high amounts of energy can be stored (19.6 MJ/m3 or 17.9 J/g), six times higher than the best previously reported, while maintaining near 100% shape fixity and recovery. Shape memory polymers (SMPS) are promising materials in many emerging applications such as soft robotics, deployable hinges or space structures, sealants and smart biomedical sutures, due to their excellent shape recovery and other properties. However, practical application is limited by poor energy densities (1 MJ/m3). Achieving high energy density SMPs that simultaneously possess high recovery stress and large recoverable strain poses a significant challenge. The Stanford team's solution is a novel shape memory mechanism based on the formation of strain-induced supramolecular structures by polymer chains with dynamic bonds. Under strain, the polymer chains align into stable and hierarchically organized supramolecular nanostructures, trapping the stretched polymer chains in a highly elongated state.

    "ip_description": "Stanford researchers in the Swartz lab have developed a method for improving the productivity of biosynthetic processes via enzymatic detoxification of aberrant forms of NAD(P)H. The 1,6- and 1,2-NAD(P)H tautomers of the reducing equivalent carrier NAD(P)H are strong inhibitors of enzyme-catalyzed redox reactions that are critical for protein synthesis and other biosynthetic processes. Since the detoxification of these aberrant forms of NAD(P)H requires molecular oxygen as a substrate, they can accumulate in anaerobic industrial bioprocesses. Even in aerobic cell-free bioprocesses, the native oxidases present are often not sufficient to detoxify these byproducts, hampering overall productivity. In this invention, scientists in the Swartz lab have developed methods to detoxify 1,6- and 1,2-NAD(P)H with enzymes (e.g., renalase or 1,6-NAD(P)H/1,2-NAD(P)H oxidases) that use molecular oxygen to convert these aberrant forms back into the original NAD(P)H. For the case of anaerobic bioprocesses, this invention also provides methods for establishing a secondary bioreactor for this aerobic reaction and for managing the input and removal of molecular oxygen as the biosynthetic mixture leaves and reenters between the main anaerobic reactor and a secondary aerobic bioreactor. When added to an existing industrial biosynthesis process, this technology can greatly improve the efficiency of the production of proteins and other biochemicals at scale by removing these inhibitory byproducts. Applications include cell-free protein synthesis, biofuel production, biopharmaceutical production, and bioproduction of agricultural commodities. Advantages include improved productivity through enzymatic conversion of aberrant NAD(P)H tautomers back to NAD(P)H, which improves efficiency of redox reactions in both aerobic and anaerobic biosynthetic reactors, and the novelty of the method, as no method or device yet exists for removal of these inhibitory forms of NAD(P)H.",

The incorporation of the carbon from carbon dioxide into biofuels and other biochemicals would help counteract global warming while also producing useful commodities. However, since carbon dioxide is highly oxidized, it requires a large quantity of reducing equivalents to be converted into the necessary precursors for production of biochemicals. These reducing equivalents could in theory be supplied by hydrogen gas, but hydrogen gas is difficult to transfer into aqueous solution and to convert into a form that biosynthetic enzymes can use in redox reactions. In this invention, scientists in the Swartz lab have developed a process that converts hydrogen gas into NAD(P)H reducing equivalents for biosynthetic reactions. First, a stream of bioreactor fluid is removed, pressurized, and then injected with pressurized hydrogen gas. When returned to the reactor, the supersaturated gas will come out of solution to form very small bubbles of pure hydrogen for good mass transfer. This hydrogen can then be used by a simple secondary enzymatic pathway in a cell-free reaction that generates the NAD(P)H required to reduce carbon dioxide into useful forms that capture carbon. Applications include carbon-negative, cell-free production of biochemicals including biofuels, biopharmaceuticals, and agricultural commodity chemicals.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at Stanford have developed a generalized protease-responsive platform, called RELEASE, to control the secretion and display of proteins. RELEASE (Retained Endoplasmic Cleavable Secretion) is poised to enable local, programmable delivery of intercellular cues for a broad variety of fields such as neurobiology, cancer immunotherapy and cell transplantation. Across biomedicine, regulating the secretion and surface display of signaling proteins is crucial to program intercellular communication. Protein-based 'circuits' have advantages such as fast operation, compact delivery and robust performance compared to traditional synthetic circuits. However, these protein circuits have operated only inside the cell, and there remains an urgent need for a design that enables protein-level control of intercellular communication. To this end, the Stanford team created RELEASE, a modular design with engineered proteins retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and displayed/secreted in response to specific proteases. Their design allows functional regulation of multiple synthetic and natural proteins by synthetic protease circuits to realize diverse signal processing capabilities, including logic operation and threshold tuning. Linking RELEASE to additional sensing and processing circuits can achieve elevated protein secretion in response to 'undruggable' oncogene KRAS mutants. As reported in _Nature Communications_, the researchers have shown that RELEASE is compatible with circuit-level functions, controls biologically relevant proteins, responds to oncogenic inputs, and supports plug-and-play capabilities. Applications include improving cell therapies, cancer immunotherapy, and neurobiology research. Advantages of RELEASE include enabling novel therapeutic modalities in cancer immunotherapy, protease circuit components that can be encoded within single mRNA transcripts without the risk of insertional mutagenesis, and compatibility with pre-existing protein-based synthetic circuits that directly integrate with the signal transduction pathways of the host.",

    "ip_description": "Stanford inventors have developed a near infrared (NIR) tumor imaging platform that couples a novel rare earth cancer targeting agent and a handheld NIR-IIb fluorescence imager to enable tumor resection down to the few-cell level. Surgical removal of tumors remains a cornerstone of cancer treatment, but with visual inspection alone, incomplete removal of cancerous residues or excess removal of healthy tissue is still quite common. Surgeons have used near infrared imaging with fluorophores in the 800-900nm range to help visualize tumor margins, but there is significant light scattering and autofluorescence in that optical window that limits the tumor-to-normal-tissue signal ratios to ~1.1 to 7. This invention is an imager and accompanying imaging agent that uses light in the 1500-1700nm range to improve the tumor-to-normal-tissue ratio ~100 times. An anti-CD105 conjugate that uses a novel rare earth down-conversion nanoparticle targets the tumor and labels it for NIR imaging, while a handheld imager that produces both a photographic and NIR image guides resection down to the few-cell level. The researchers have shown both the sensitivity and safety of this imaging platform, which has the potential to usher in a new paradigm of image-guided tumor resection. Applications include imaging platform for high-resolution tumor resection guidance during surgery, platform for tumor imaging before surgery, and near infrared imaging agent for diverse applications in research and clinical imaging. Advantages include tumor-to-muscle ratios during surgery of ~300, 100 times higher than with organic dyes, tumor-to-normal-tissue ratios of ~40 before surgery, as compared to ~1.1 to 7 for previous technologies, and imaging in a NIR-IIb near infrared spectrum (1500-1700nm) shows lower background than with the current NIR imaging agents that operate in the 800-900nm range.",

As a monogenic immune disease, IPEX is an ideal candidate for a gene therapy approach whereby patient hematopoietic stem and progenitor (HSPC) cells or T cells are gene corrected ex vivo and reinfused in the patient. The Bacchetta, Roncarolo, and Porteus Labs at Stanford developed a CRISPR-based FOXP3 gene correction approach that uses homology directed repair to insert a FOXP3 cDNA into the endogenous gene locus and permit regulated expression of wild-type FOXP3 protein irrespective of downstream mutations. This site-specific approach is designed to benefit a broad range of IPEX patients, given that the causative mutations are located downstream of the insertion site. The technique permits gene delivery to patient-derived HSPCs for an autologous transplant or to T cells for autologous cell therapy. The method uniquely restores physiological expression of FOXP3 and repairs the function of multiple cell lineages disrupted by the FOXP3 mutations that is responsible for disease manifestations. This novel approach is thus suitable for developing therapies for IPEX patients with diverse FOXP3 mutations.\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   IPEX syndrome therapies\n*   Autoimmune disease\n*   Cell therapies\n*   CRISPR-based therapies\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   Compatible with all patients and is site-specific\n*   Restores multiple lineages and targets multiple mutations",

    "ip_description": "Polycythemia vera is a rare blood cancer characterized by the hyperproliferation of red blood cells, leading to coagulation events like strokes and heart attacks. There are no curative treatments available, only symptom management in the form of treatments with suboptimal side effect profiles. The condition is caused by a mutation in the JAK2 gene, which could be corrected via a gene editing strategy. However, a gene editing approach remains challenging due to the need to retain activity from the wild type JAK2 allele for normal hematopoiesis. Further, the mutant site needs to be edited with near perfect efficiency to prevent the eventual expansion of the proliferative mutant populations. Inventors at Stanford's Porteus lab have developed a CRISPR-based method in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to deactivate the JAK2 mutation most frequently altered in polycythemia vera and related myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Using a system that incorporates two guide RNAs, the inventors were able to develop a targeting method to limit insertions and deletions in exons of the wild type allele, while the mutant sequence can be specifically targeted for nuclease activity. The mutant gene is then repaired via homologous recombination, with the normal donor template delivered in an AAV6 capsid. In in vitro experiments using human doner hematopoietic stem cells, the gene editing technique produced efficient replacement of the mutant JAK2 allele, with minimal impact on the wild type allele. Edited cells can subsequently be used as a starting material for autologous bone marrow transplant. Stage of development: In vitro proof of concept in patient-derived HSCs, in vivo research ongoing.

This enhanced growth and/or proliferation leads to the enrichment of the cells relative to unmodified cells _in vitro_ and/or _in vivo_.

    "ip_description": "Stanford inventors have developed an alternative slide coating for multiplexed ion beam imaging using a conductive organic polymer material. This new technology eliminates the high background noise from the use of gold slide coatings and improves conductivity for imaging thick, dense tissue. Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) is an imaging technology based on secondary ion beam mass spectrometry that enables the use of heavy metal isotope-conjugated antibody stains to label histological samples with a high number of cellular markers (40+). Currently, MIBI requires the use of gold in sample slides to create the conductive surface necessary to prevent surface charge accumulation which would cause inconsistent signal across the region of interest. However, in very porous tissues (like lung), exposed gold can produce a high amount of background noise, and in very dense tissues (like brain tissue), lack of conductivity can still be an issue even with gold coatings. In this invention, Stanford scientists have discovered a new organic polymer material for coating MIBI slides that eliminates background noise from gold coatings and improves conductivity. This new slide design improves MIBI imaging performance over gold-coated slides and provides a transparent slide material to allow sample imaging with light-based microscopy as well. Applications: Improved slide coating material for multiplexed ion beam imaging for applications like biological research, pathology, and diagnostics.

    "ip_description": "Drs. Shanjani, Yang and Goodman in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Stanford University have developed an implant that promotes generation of natural bone and vasculature for use in the treatment of early stage osteonecrosis of the hip (ONH) also known as avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip. The hip is a ball and socket joint with the head of the femur (thighbone) serving as the ball. ONH is a painful condition that occurs when blood supply to the ball (femoral head) is disrupted. This condition can lead to collapse of the ball, subsequent arthritis and eventual need for total hip replacement. Several surgical strategies, including core decompression of the necrotic segment of bone with or without local bone grafting, are strategies to try and preserve the hip during the early stages of the disease. However, these options are not always successful and total hip replacement may still be needed despite the early intervention. Thus, there is a need for improved treatment strategies for early stage ONH to provide both a biologically sound treatment and mechanical support. To help meet this need the inventors have developed a biomimetic load-bearing and bioactive functionally-graded implant for reconstitution of the osteonecrotic area at early stages. This technology will prevent the progress of osteonecrosis by promoting generation of natural bone and vasculature and will eliminate the need for total hip replacement. The implant is made by additive manufacturing technology and can be customized in terms of geometrical dimensions and internal micro-structure for the individual patient. The manufacturing process is also very cost effective. Implantation of the device is fairly straightforward and comparable to current techniques. Stage of research: The inventors have fabricated the implant and performed physical and mechanical characterization. In addition, preliminary animal studies have been conducted and show the implant has great promise. Related technology: Dr. Yang and colleagues have developed a new biodegradable, photocrosslinkable polymer (see Stanford Docket S14-265) that may be used as an alternative material to create the implant. Applications: Treatment of ONH at early stage (ARCO I and II, and early stage III), Research- tissue engineering studies, The implant can be supplemented with other biologically based additions such as growth factors, small molecules, cells, etc. Advantages: Improves efficacy of treatment for early stage ONH, Biodegradable- implant will be replaced by natural bone, Geometrically customizable for the patient, Improved integration capability compared to current treatments, Easy to implant, Eliminates need for autologous grafts, Eliminates need for revision surgeries, Avoids total hip replacement.",

    "ip_number": "S18-196",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers in Prof. David Myung's laboratory have developed a bio-compatible, crosslinking gel that can be used for in situ repair of damaged cornea or as a three-dimensional scaffold for keratocyte-keratinocyte tissue culture. This click chemistry technology uses bio-orthogonal SPAAC (strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition) crosslinking to provide a corneal stromal substitute based on collagen type I. The viscous injectable material could be safely applied to a wounded cornea where it reacts to form a gel scaffold able to promote tissue repair without sutures or a human donor. The gel recapitulates the thickness and smooth, continuous surface of the cornea so it can be used as a three-dimensional acellular scaffold or a scaffold that encapsulates cultured cells (keratocytes). In research applications, the scaffold could be used for three-dimensional tissue culture to synthesize lamellar substitutes or to study keratocyte-keratinocyte interactions. In wound healing applications, this technology is a promising candidate for in situ lamellar and defect reconstruction of corneal stromal tissue in cases of deep corneal ulcers to rapidly stabilize wounds or to replace a section of the cornea.\n\nThe inventors have characterized the transparency and mechanical properties of the crosslinked gel (transmittance: 84.58 +/- 1.44%; storage modulus: 112.03 +/- 3.94 Pa). Using a rabbit cornea organ culture model, they demonstrated that the SPAAC gels promoted multi-layer re-epithelialization as well as good apposition and adherence to the host tissues.\n\nApplications:\n- **Ocular wound healing:**\n  - injectable, in situ-forming scaffold to fill, stabilize and regenerate deep corneal wounds, particularly in patients where the risks and morbidities associated with penetrating the globe are high (e.g., keratoplasty for deep ulcers or severe thinning)\n  - in vitro system for synthesizing cellular or acellular lamellar substitutes\n  - delivery vehicle for therapeutic factors that aid in wound healing\n- **Tissue scaffold for ophthalmologic research** - three-dimensional in vitro model system for studying keratocyte-keratinocyte interactions within corneal tissue\n\nAdvantages:\n- **Minimally-invasive:**\n  - administered at the point of care by injection with no sutures\n  - no need for human donor\n- **Bio-compatible:**\n  - non-toxic SPAAC (strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition) crosslinking relies on bio-orthogonal click-chemistry that is compatible with living tissue\n  - gel scaffold integrates with surrounding tissues\n  - gel reacts in water and ambient conditions with no external catalyst and produces no side products\n- **Transparent matrix** - crosslinked collagen gel has transmittance of 84.58 +/- 1.44%, enabling corneal wound healing applications",

    "ip_description": "Stanford University researchers have developed a system that achieves atmospheric water harvesting with high specific productivity, defined as the rate of water collected per mass of absorbent material. Metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for cooling applications due to their high water vapor absorption capacity, but have been cost-prohibitive due to the lower water recovery rates associated with low adsorption/desorption cycle frequencies. The invention enables high productivity by rapid mass transfer of vapor by fluidization of MOFs. Fluidization is a proven and scale-able process wherein powders are suspended in a column of air. This fluidization dramatically increases the surface area of absorbent exposed to an airstream and also decreases diffusion length scales. The improvement in vapor absorption and desorption rates enables cycle operation of up to 50 cycles per day, compared to 8 cycles or less from conventional methods. Fluidized bed systems are currently used in a wide range of industries, demonstrating the feasibility of the idea.\n\n**Stage of Development**\nProof of concept for MOF fluidization as a rapidly cycled water vapor sorption unit\n\nApplications\n------------\n\n*   Improve power cycle efficiency of power plants\n*   Refrigeration and air conditioning\n\nAdvantages\n----------\n\n*   The invention improves the specific throughtput achievable with porous MOFs, materials that effectively absorb water vapor, which decreases operating costs\n*   Yields water vapor harvesting rates an order of magnitude higher rate (per weight of absorbent) than existing technology\n*   Fluidization of MOFs is a scalable technology already in use in a wide range of industries",

    "ip_number": "S21-166",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Using their newly developed acetyl-click screening platform, researchers at Stanford have identified riboflavin analogs as small molecule inhibitors of Histone Acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) with anti-cancer activity. The lead compound has been shown to suppress growth of human cancer cells lines _in vitro_ and impair tumor growth _in vivo_. **This is the first report of a small molecule inhibitor of the HAT1 enzyme complex and represents a step towards targeting this pathway for cancer therapy**. HAT1, an enzyme that acetylates the histone H4, is involved in many human disorders and conditions including cancer, aging, immune diseases, organ rejection, and viral infections. It has been shown to be overexpressed in various cancers and to promote tumorigenesis, as well as to promote HIV and hepatitis (especially HBV) infection and replication. To determine whether targeting HAT1 is a viable anti-cancer treatment strategy, the researchers sought to identify small molecule inhibitors of HAT1. They developed a high-throughput, click-chemistry-enabled HAT1 acetylation assay to facilitate drug discovery and enzymology. Screening of small molecules computationally predicted to bind the active site led to the discovery of multiple riboflavin analogs that inhibited HAT1 enzymatic activity by competing with acetyl-CoA binding. Hits were refined by synthesis and testing over 70 analogs, which yielded structure-activity relationships. Lead compound results from pre-clinical mouse models indicate that HAT1 can be successfully targeted in vivo to achieve anti-tumor efficacy. Applications: Anti-cancer drugs targeting tumors with high HAT1 levels, high glucose flux, EGFR mutations, KRAS mutations, PTEN mutations, Rbap46 mutations, and Rbap48 mutations. Antiviral drugs for diseases such as, HIV, hepatitis B and C, where HAT1 plays a role in viral replication. Advantages: Possible first-in-class inhibitor. Currently there are no acetyltransferase inhibitors approved for any indication. This work is the first to suggest that HAT1 may be a therapeutic vulnerability in cancers with an acceptable toxicity profile.",
