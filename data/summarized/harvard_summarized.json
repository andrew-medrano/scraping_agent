    "ip_description": "Sensors using individual atomic defects in diamond have revolutionized local magnetic sensing. This technology is based on the insight that higher densities of defects can produce more sensitive detectors. However, at very high densities, interactions between defects complicate the detector operation. Specifically, when the spins in a quantum detector get too close, they typically hit an interaction-limited sensitivity threshold. This technology innovation considered the effect of a periodic external field that depends on the nature of the interactions. The discovery uses a periodic driving of the spin system to enable a sensor to surpass previous limits on using high densities of spins.\n\nThis fundamental innovation applies to spin ensembles in general. These are ubiquitous in solid matter, either due to spins of the atomic nuclei, or due to localized electron spins as in the case of nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond. In particular, the technique could be used to sense the magnetic field at the surface of a dense, 2D array of nitrogen-vacancy defects. Alternatively, Carbon-13 nuclei doped into graphene could also be driven into the collective states that form the basis of the sensing strategy.\n\nApplications of magnetic field sensing using nitrogen vacancy centers are broad, including quantum computing applications, molecular sensing for chemistry and pharmaceutical applications, cell biology, and more.",

    "ip_description": "In the field of diamond-defect-based quantum information processing, electron spins at defect sites sit within a diamond spin-vacuum and external interface is enabled via photon emission. In comparison to nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond, silicon-vacancy (SiV) defects possess superior coherence of emitted photons, but limited spin coherence. In this invention, the team identified and overcame this spin coherence limitation by cooling the SiV defect below the spin-orbit energy, thereby splitting responsibility for the poor spin coherence. Below this temperature threshold the spin qubit exhibits a superb spin coherence time of 13 ms, exceeding many competing technologies. As a result, the system embodies an important quantum building block, since it entangles a non-local photon with a localized, coherent electron spin. This achievement could form the basis for a quantum computing system longer term, but more near term could be applied to constructing a quantum network and in quantum security applications. By the time the spin in the cryostat decoheres, the photon can propagate down an optical fiber to a distance (~ 103 km) comparable to global distance scales.",

The platform is highly customizable and is compatible with many cell types, ranging from bacteria to mammalian cells. Growing cells can be observed across complex and changing environmental conditions by virtually any type of microscopy, and any individual cell(s) of interest can be recovered for further downstream processing such as multi-omics or functional profiling. The team hopes to partner with an industry collaborator to demonstrate high-throughput phenotypic screening and subsequent isolation of select cells in a commercial context.\n\nThe device addresses shortcomings with current single-cell screening methods. Cytometry-based techniques often struggle to disentangle genetically heritable states from transient phenotypic variability since only single snapshots are considered, failing to capture dynamic processes. Screens that rely on microplates in turn suffer from limited throughput and require arrayed library formats. Pooled techniques that implicate genetic barcodes require upstream molecular cloning and severely limit the complexity and range of variants that can be characterized. The invention presented here resolves even slight phenotypic differences with quantitative multi-image classifications; operates at high-throughput due to scalable microfluidic designs that allow for parallelized screening; and accepts cellular populations of arbitrary diversities, including pooled genetic libraries and ecological samples, as variants are physically accommodated and collected.\n\nThe team believes that the detailed phenotyping and live-cell extraction features \u2013 coupled with high throughput and low cost of fabrication \u2013 give the technology significant potential to complement, and even supplant in many instances, conventional cytometry- and microplate-based screening tools.

To achieve this multifunctionality, para-aramid nanofiber sheets were fabricated with empty space between the fibers.

Further, the vector has a low toxicity profile and avoids concerns with unintended off-target reactions observed with traditional viral vectors as a result of its non-replicating behavior. Among the vectored antigens developed in the lab is the SARS virus spike protein.

The team is seeking industrial collaboration with COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers to ensure robust and persistent immune responses. Developing the HSV-1 d106S vector with the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein antigen offers many advantages over existing vaccine vector technologies. First, although HSV-1 is a common infection, pre-existing HSV-1 immunity has little impact on the efficacy of the HSV-1 vaccine vectors in a mouse model. Second, the HSV replication-defective vectors induce a strong Th1 helper T cell response. As such, this vector induces a strong priming immune response.

The team is hoping to collaborate with manufacturers of COVID-19 vaccines to further demonstrate enhanced immune responses to infectious disease antigens. Despite decades of adjuvant research, only four adjuvants have been approved in the seven major markets. Of these, only two (Alum and AS04) are licensed in the United States. Any additional adjuvants would need to meet stringent safety requirements imposed by the regulatory authorities. Although Alum is safe and efficacious, it has proven unsuccessful in several infectious disease applications. To address this unmet need, the lab of Dr. von Andrian began to explore alternatives to the traditional adjuvant modalities.

    "ip_description": "Researchers in the lab of Prof. George Church at Harvard Medical School have developed a vaccine platform technology that can be applied to fields such as infectious diseases and oncology therapeutics. The team is looking to further demonstrate enhanced immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines through industrial collaboration. The discovery was made to help overcome deficiencies with classical in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA. IVT-mRNA contain the code for protein production, and when delivered to target cells, are translated by cell machinery to produce antigen. The antigen, which could be cancer- or pathogen-specific, subsequently elicit an immune response from the host. While IVT-mRNA represents a novel vaccine class and provides advantages over traditional protein vaccines, such as ease of manufacture and favorable safety profile, one challenge is potentially insufficient immunity induced by IVT-mRNA alone. Through study of the mechanisms of mRNA translation and innate immunity, the Church lab found that a critical aspect of generating a strong immune response to the vaccine was to activate the RIG-I virus surveillance mechanism of the cell. To accomplish this, the team developed an IVT-mRNA vaccine platform that combines the antigen-coding sequence in addition to a RIG-I activating adjuvant sequence within a single mRNA transcript. This strategy is a departure from classic strategies which involve co-administration of adjuvant with the IVT-mRNA transcript and allows precise spatial control of antigen and adjuvant, as well as \u201ctunable\u201d immuno-stimulation. Results demonstrate that this highly versatile strategy generates robust immune responses compared to unmodified IVT-mRNA for infectious disease and neo-antigen oncology vaccines.",

The discovery was made when researchers realized that membrane proteins critical for eliciting host immune response were not being recognized due to challenges in liposome assembly, the most common technique used for protein antigen presentation. These challenges include instability of the protein-liposome assemblies, and inability to control the orientation of the membrane protein, which is critical for antibody binding and subsequent immune signaling. To overcome these issues, the lab sought to stabilize and fix the orientation of these protein-liposome assemblies by anchoring them to nanoparticles. The team accomplishes this by generating bicelles that contain a membrane protein functionalized with an affinity tag. This affinity tag then binds to its specific binding receptor located on the surface of the nanoparticle.

These systems employ point defects in crystal lattices, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds, as quantum sensors. In typical use, an optical source is used to excite an array of sensors, and the value of the physical quantity is inferred from the measured amplitude modulation. However, the excitation can deposit heat into the system, which can contribute false signals. Excess heat may also prevent use of the system with temperature-sensitive samples, such as biological samples. Additionally, vibrational displacement of the sensors relative to the optical excitation source can affect measurement sensitivity. Thus, a stable mounting platform that can remove heat from the system is desirable to enable solid state spin sensors to operate at their full potential. Metals such as copper and aluminum are widely used as heatsinks due to their high thermal conductivity, however, the use of such materials for mounting solid state spin sensors can be problematic since electrically conductive materials can interfere with delivery of microwave radiation.

    "ip_description": "A gene therapy startup emerging from the lab of George Church intends to deploy adeno-associated viruses (AAV) for gene transfer in the skin. The nascent company, called MARBLE, aims to target genetic diseases of the skin as well as age-related declines in skin function and appearance, combining classic monogenic disease targets alongside novel aging driver genes. While AAV has the best safety profile and history of clinical efficacy of any gene therapy vector, it has not previously been applied to skin indications due to a number of technical limits. Transduction of cells in situ within the skin is inefficient, and diffusion within the skin limited. The small packaging capacity of AAV constrains the use of large transgenes, such as structural proteins essential for treating diseases of the skin. More fundamentally, delivery across the outer barrier of the skin is difficult, with established methods being highly variable and mechanically traumatic, resulting in an immune response which complicates future applications using the same AAV system. A technology platform developed in the Church Lab addresses these issues through a combination of molecular and materials innovations. Researchers have identified multiple AAV serotypes with strong ability to infect skin cells, enabling gene transfer and avoidance of preexisting immunity. The technology enables delivery of long genes via reduction of gene regulatory elements and an RNA splicing and DNA recombination-enabled multi-vector system. The novel technology platform aims to solve transdermal delivery through formulation of AAV vectors into polymer devices. Gene therapy agents and pharmacological molecules are delivered directly into skin tissues via transient tissue microchannels, enabling rapid micro-scale mass transport that results in high local concentrations. Unlike conventional injections, this polymeric delivery system is minimally invasive due to the superficial administration, which reduces pain and host immune response, a critical advantage for enabling re-dosing. Taken together, the safety and efficacy of the platform further enable development of age-related aesthetic and quality-of-life treatments, targeting novel skin aging genes identified through a uniquely powerful data analytics approach.",

David Mooney\u2019s lab has used biphasic ferrogel scaffolds to create a system capable of massage-like compressions to promote muscle regeneration after severe injury. These scaffolds are implanted at the site of muscle injury, and an exterior magnetic field stimulates uniform cyclic compressions. Use of this system in a mouse model of severe muscle damage led to reduced fibrous capsule formation around the implants when compared to no treatment, as well as when compared to a similar compression treatment applied with an external pressure cuff. It also led to reduced fibrosis and inflammation in the injured muscle, enhanced muscle regeneration, and increase in mean muscle fiber size. Functionally, mice treated with cyclic mechanical compressions exhibited an increase in maximum contractile force of the injured muscle after two weeks. The ferrogels also exhibited an immunomodulatory role when stimulated, showing reduced levels of muscle-infiltrating inflammatory cells and macrophages.\n\n**Applications**\n\nBiphasic ferrogel scaffolds showed utility in a mouse model severe skeletal muscle injuries, which can lead to fibrosis, scarring, and loss of function. Currently, there is no therapeutic intervention that allows for a full functional restoration of severely injured muscle tissue. The improvement in muscle fiber size using this method, however, was of the same order of magnitude as cell and drug delivery approaches, and the functional gain was comparable to that of growth factor therapies.

This provides a biologic-free system for a simple but effective alternative to cell-based therapies. Incorporation of cyclic mechanical compressions into existing drug and cell delivery systems could also potentially lead to new and better combination therapies.

The method for fabrication of the sensors is simple, low-cost, and scalable, and the sensors are portable and can be used at the point-of-use.\n\nCommercial ion-sensing electrodes are big, bulky, delicate (with glass enclosures), and expensive and require large sample volumes. The technology uses ion-sensing electrodes using threads and heat shrinkable tubing (both low-cost materials) which perform similar to commercial electrodes, but can measure in much smaller sample volumes and are suitable for point-of-use or point-of-care. The thread-based ion-sensors are capable of multiplexed ion-sensing at the point-of-care and can be used as single-use devices or for multiple uses.\n\nMost research for developing ion-sensors has been focused on using paper as a substrate, this work demonstrates the advantages of thread over paper, and shows that thread-based ion-sensing has more capabilities than paper-based ion sensing.\n\nFor physicians who are looking for an affordable device to measure levels of blood electrolytes at the point-of-care, the thread-based ion-selective electrodes enable this analysis and unlike clinical analyzers and handheld analyzers such as i-Stat, do not cost thousands of dollars.

    "ip_number": "6891",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) containing outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria prevent penetration of antibiotics, making them ineffective against infections. Polymyxins, including colistin, bind LPS and disrupt the outer membrane and hence are the drugs of last resort for treating Gram-negative infections; however, their toxicity limits their usefulness. These drugs function synergistically with many antibiotics, including novobiocin \u2013 a DNA gyrase inhibitor, by facilitating the transport of many across the outer membrane. Novobiocin was recently shown to stimulate LptB, the ATPase that powers LPS transport. Prof. Kahne's team synthesized derivatives of novobiocin by making structural changes to the noviose sugar and replacing the benzamide with a suitable group, hence separating the DNA gyrase inhibition and LptB stimulation activities from each other. One set of these analogs is unable to inhibit DNA gyrase, making it nontoxic, while retaining LptB-stimulatory activity. These analogs improve the novobiocin\u2212polymyxin synergy and enhance the lethality of polymyxin by binding LptB stimulation. Another set inhibit DNA gyrase better than or equal to novobiocin, but bind better to LptB and therefore have even greater LptB stimulatory activity. When used in combination with polymyxin, these analogs are more potent than novobiocin, and may allow the use of lower doses of polymyxin, increasing its efficacy and safety. The rational framework developed by Prof. Kahne allows the design of novobiocin analogs with both improved gyrase inhibition and LPS transport stimulation activity. Tested analogs demonstrate that it is possible to improve the LPS release activity of novobiocin, and enable greatly improved synergy with polymyxin. Co-administration of polymyxin with these novobiocin analogs could signify increased efficacy and reduced polymyxin toxicity in the treatment of challenging Gram negative infections.",

However, conventional NQR relies on inductive coils to detect the microwave-frequency signal from macroscopic samples, and is not sensitive enough to measure atomically-thin layers. To overcome the sensitivity limitation, the present invention employs an individual nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond to detect the microwave-frequency signal. The NV center is created very close to the diamond surface (depth < 10 nm), and the sample of 2D material is placed directly on the diamond surface. The NV center is probed using a combination of microwaves and laser light so as to maximize sensitivity to the NQR frequencies of interest. The proximity of the sensor to the sample greatly boosts sensitivity, enabling detection of NQR signals even from samples that are only a few atomic layers thick.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Functions of various biotherapeutics can often be enhanced by modifying individual amino acid residues. However, the current approaches rely on existing natural amino acid chemistry. Approaches that provide new chemical \u201chandles\u201d will add versatility to modifications with an ultimate aim to enhance efficacy. An exciting way to provide these new sites in vivo, is through the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAA\u2019s) into biotherapeutics. ncAA\u2019s can be designed while keeping in mind the chemistry needed for subsequent modification.\n\nThere are four components that are crucial in ncAA incorporation and are (i) the ncAA itself; (ii) the codon that codes for the ncAA; (ii) the tRNA that recognizes the targeted codon and (iv) the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (AARSs) that ligate the ncAA to the tRNA. Of these four components, generating novel AARS is the most challenging and generation of novel variants has been hampered by the long selection time needed in laboratory-based evolution of existing AARS.\n\nIn order to catalyze the development of AARSs, the Liu lab has adopted Phage-Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE) for AARS evolution. The ability to rapidly move through a single evolution cycle, coupled with the ability to perform hundreds of such cycles, makes PACE a great tool for AARS evolution. Application of this technology to pyrolosyl-tRNA synthetase (PyIRS) led to the discovery of novel variants with 45 fold greater enzymatic efficiency. In addition, when this system was used to translate a model protein (sGFP), 10 fold increases in yields were observed. Lastly, the PACE system was used to increase selectivity such that a PACE-derived variant of tyrosyl \u2013tRNA synthetase demonstrated a 23 fold higher specificity for the desired substrate p-iodo-L-phenylalanine. These results ([Nat Chem Biol. 2017 Dec;13(12):1253-1260](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29035361)) establish PACE as a robust method for evolving AARSs.\n\nExpansion of the genetic code through ncAA\u2019s can facilitate the incorporation of features into proteins that are useful in research as well as in therapeutic product development. Genetically encoding photo cross-linkers, spectroscopic probes, can be used to enhance our understanding of the natural environment in which proteins exist. On the therapeutic front, amino-acid modifications that mimic post-translational modifications can lead to improved thermostability and chemostability. Various applications of genetic code expansion are only beginning to be appreciated and tools such as PACE derived AARS will undoubtedly play an enabling and important role in unlocking its full potential.",

    "ip_description": "Template-directed synthesis of modified DNA sequences can provide a rich source of material for generating new therapies featuring modified nucleic acid polymers. The Liu lab has previously developed pioneering methods to generate nucleic acid based polymers with modified side chains ([J. Am. Chem. Soc. 135, 98\u2013101 (2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23256841)). Further improvements have been made in both the codon design and side chain design thus enabling a larger and more diverse library to be interrogated for desired chemical outcomes. Despite this diversity, key features important for iterative evolution/selection processes (such as Polymerase Chain Reaction and Watson-Crick base pairing) are retained. The process can further be simplified if prior knowledge exists regarding the need for specific scaffolds as the starting library can be based on this knowledge. Screening/selection of libraries made from such highly functionalized nucleic acid polymers (HFNAPs) led to the identification of highly evolved HFNAPs that can bind therapeutically relevant human proteins as discussed below.\n\nPCSK9 binds the Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR) and promotes degradation of the latter. Blocking PCSK9-LDLR interactions can lead to a decrease in systemic levels of low density lipoprotein particles (due to higher availability of LDLR) and dramatically improve cardiovascular outcomes. Through the use of HFNAP technology, highly potent polymers that block PCSK9-LDL receptor interactions were discovered with Kd\u2019s in the low nM range. Results from the selection process as well as those from structure-activity studies identified the importance of specific modifications and their polymeric positions in mediating PCSK9 binding. Interleukin-6 (IL6) binding HFNAPs were also identified using a similar approach and collectively, these results demonstrates the general applicability of HFNAP as a platform technology to target disease-associated proteins.

    "ip_number": "6939",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Precise target identification for small molecules is an important and essential step in drug development. Despite its importance, there are very few unbiased, proteome-wide approaches aimed at identifying binding partners for small molecules. In addition, failure to identify unintended binding interactions can cause unexpected toxicity. Early and comprehensive identification of bound proteins will allow drug development programs to design medicinal chemistry efforts targeted at avoiding toxicity due to off-target effects. The Woo lab has designed an innovative platform technology, called SIM-PAL (for small molecule interactome mapping by photo-affinity labeling) to precisely map regions within proteins that bind small molecules. Using a combination of chemical tagging, enrichment, mass spectrometry and informatics, SIM-PAL can provide a high resolution (peptide-level) view of the small molecule interactome. Since it can be performed in cellulo, the interactions are biologically relevant and context-dependent variations can be identified. Proof of concept experiments have been completed using NSAID\u2019s and the results were recapitulated using classical methods of target validation, such as temperature shift assays. Due to its scalabilty and versatility, SIM-PAL is poised to transform an important and essential step in the drug discovery process.",

    "ip_description": "The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) helps maintain a constant, optimal environment for neuronal function through a combination of barriers and selective transport systems that regulate the passage of wanted and unwanted molecules. While important for brain functionality, the BBB presents a formidable challenge to medicine because it stops most drugs from passing from the bloodstream to the brain. Importantly, BBB compromise has been associated with several neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Work published in Nature in 2014 and Neuron in 2017 by the Gu lab identified a mechanism responsible for BBB maintenance, involving the suppression of vesicle-mediated transfer of blood-plasma constituents to the brain (transcytosis). This suppression was shown to depend on a transmembrane protein, Mfsd2a, specific to the endothelial cells that line blood vessels in the brain. Current work in the Gu lab is focused on characterization of a potential drug candidate - Mfsd2a blocking antibody. We are looking for collaborators interested in delivery drugs to the brain using this antibody. Another line of work in the Gu lab is dedicated to further elucidation of the role of BBB in neurodegeneration and identification of potential novel therapeutic targets. To advance this research, we would like to work with collaborators interested in discovery of BBB integrity enhancers.",

    "ip_description": "Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a life-threatening monogenic disease that affects nearly 1 million people in the U.S. alone. ADPKD represents a very large unmet medical need, currently without remedy. It is characterized by progressive growth of cysts that progressively replace normal tissue, which eventually leads to kidney failure, requiring chronic dialysis or transplantation. PKD is caused by inhibitory mutations in PKD1 or PKD2, two interacting membrane proteins that activate a signaling pathway required to suppress cystogenesis. However, a major barrier in this field has been the lack of a tractable system for dissecting the ADPKD pathway. The Salic lab in the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School has developed a rapid and robust quantitative cell-based system to molecularly dissect the PKD pathway. Using this system, the lab has identified direct transcriptional targets of the PKD pathway, including several genes implicated in cystogenesis. This ongoing project employs a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to further discover novel components of the PKD pathway, particularly negative regulators, which could serve as targets for rescuing defective signaling in disease. The lab aims to use this knowledge to discover novel small molecules capable of correcting the cellular defects that cause the disease.",

While dependency of cancer cells on FAO has been known, the underlying mechanistic understanding has yet to be translated into clinical benefits. As described in a paper published in Molecular Cell, Dr. Haigis and her group at Harvard Medical School have identified Prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) as a regulator of a molecular pathway that drives a cancer cell's dependency on FAO as its primary energy source. Re-expression of PHD3 in cancer cells led to activation of acetyl-coA carboxylase 2 (ACC2), reduction of tumor cell proliferation and significantly higher survival rates among animals injected with PHD3-overexpressing AML cells compared to animals injected with their PHD3-low counterparts. Furthermore, pharmacological intervention with FAO inhibitors etomoxir or ranolazine led to significant cell death in PHD3-low leukemia cells. This discovery suggests that low PHD3 expression level is an indicator of the sensitivity of cancer to perturbations of FAO pathways and opens a path for development of novel cancer therapies with readily available diagnostic tools enabling identification of responder patient populations whose tumors may be sensitive to FAO inhibitors.

These rogue modifications to semiconductors can be triggered at any point and represent a latent risk. A hostile government or entity could introduce a hack into semiconductors, that once fabricated could then be embedded into smartphones, telecommunications equipment or IT infrastructure. In addition to being of great importance to chip manufacturers, software companies and systems providers, this issue is recognized as a matter of national security.\n\nThe invention described here is a device that monitors the operation of integrated circuits in real time to ensure that the device has not been hacked.

    "ip_description": "Professor David Liu and a multidisciplinary research team have recently discovered and optimized of a series of small molecules (<550 Da, IC50 = 1 nM) that inhibit the metalloprotease Insulin-Degrading Enzyme (IDE) with an unprecedented substrate-selective mechanism. IDE-mediated degradation of Insulin is completely abrogated, but the smaller substrate, Glucagon, is cleaved efficiently even at saturating concentration of inhibitor. An X-ray co-crystal structure of the ligand reveals binding to a distal pocket of IDE outside the catalytic site, which explains its remarkable affinity and specificity for IDE versus other metalloproteases, as well as its ability to competitively exclude Insulin from the IDE cavity without affecting the protease activity on other substrates, most importantly the counter-regulatory hormone, Glucagon. Recent studies using Type-2 Diabetes model mice have shown that acute IDE inhibition improves blood glucose clearance in oral glucose challenges, with concomitant elevation of insulin during experimental conditions that mimic a meal. These observations suggest an ideal therapeutic approach to selectively boost the endogenous insulin response to meals that is insufficient in pre- and mid-stage diabetic patients, allowing the body to regulate blood glucose levels and prevent the onset of disease symptoms. The Liu group is an established leader in this field and validated IDE as a therapeutic target using the first agent to inhibit IDE-mediated insulin degradation in vivo (Maianti et al, Nature, 2014, 511, p94-8). Despite the fact that IDE has been extensively associated with Type-2 Diabetes and that IDE knock-out mice display very mild phenotypes, potent, selective, and physiologically active inhibitors have not been identified. Therefore, this is a unique opportunity to develop the first pharmaceutical agents that slow down insulin degradation. Furthermore, a key advantage of using substrate-selective IDE modulators is their action on a physiological mechanism that is complementary to other FDA-approved drugs, which allows synergistic combinations with established treatments that increase insulin sensitivity (e.g. metformin) or insulin production (e.g. DPP4-i). Substrate-selective IDE inhibitors assist the body by boosting the insulin levels endogenously secreted by the pancreas in response to each meal composition. This mechanism has an advantageous safety profile with regards to hypoglycemic shock and Glucagon-driven hyperglycemia, and also protects beta-cell function on the long term, thus delaying the advance of late-stage Diabetes and the need for injectable insulin supplements.",

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely prescribed; however, because such agents act broadly on the serotonergic system en masse, they suffer from significant side effect profiles and limited efficacy. The Dymecki lab believes that these current limitations could be overcome by new therapeutic strategies that recognize and address the molecular and functional heterogeneity that exists among serotonergic neurons. Dysfunction of serotonin (5-HT) signaling in the central nervous system has been implicated in numerous debilitating and clinically distinct human disorders including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic-stress disorder (PTSD), sleep disorders, hyper-aggression, addiction, schizophrenia, autism, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and chronic pain. Over the past five years, the Dymecki lab has begun to parse 5-HT neurons into discrete molecular and functional subtypes using novel intersectional genetic methods. This approach allows selective isolation of these unique subtypes and can be used to further identify novel drug targets with the capacity to offer much improved selectivity of action on a particular serotonergic neuron subtype or circuit, and thus on a particular behavior or physiology, thereby reducing side effects and enhancing treatment efficacy over existing therapies.",

TE insertions are a prevalent class of mutagenic events that are seldom explored. TEA, therefore, enables researchers to examine the genetic basis of the pathogenesis of individual tumors.\n\n**Meerkat (Complex Structural Variations)**\n\nStructural variations in the genome such as deletions, insertions, and translocations underlie disease progression. However, these variations are difficult to detect using SNP arrays or low-coverage whole-genome sequencing. The algorithm developed by Dr. Park\u2019s group, Meerkat, takes advantage of the reads from whole-genome sequencing data to identify complex structural variations. The types of structural variations allow for the inference of causative mechanisms, and therefore uncovering information about both the genomic landscape and the underlying pathogenic pathways. This unique capability of Meerkat allows for resource prioritization over high-confidence, focused therapeutic candidates.\n\n**MSI Analysis (Microsatellite Instability)**\n\nMicrosatellite instability (MSI) results in high length polymorphism in tandem repeats in the genome, and is indicative of mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. Conventional assays for MSI are biased and time-consuming. The algorithm developed by Dr. Park\u2019s group analyzes MSI using an efficient and unbiased approach. When combined with transcriptome or epigenomic data, the MSI analysis algorithm uncovers differential gene expression of polymorphic alleles and associated epigenetic characteristics in specific cancer types. The wealth of information uncovered using MSI analysis has significant diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic values.",

Chan School of Public Health has discovered a biopesticide that is capable of sterilizing mosquitoes while being safe for human and environmental health. Spraying pesticides is a common method to control outdoor biting mosquitoes. Unfortunately, these pesticides can be toxic to humans and harmful to the environment. Furthermore, recent evidence has suggested that insects are developing resistance and causing the pesticides to be less effective. As a result, there is an unmet need to develop solutions to control outdoor biting mosquitoes that are safe and effective. Dr. Catteruccia has identified a biopesticide, a naturally occurring insect steroid hormone, which inhibits virgin female mosquitoes from mating, disrupts egg development in previously-mated female mosquitoes, and repels mosquitoes from biting. Biopesticides are inherently less toxic than conventional pesticides and are typically not harmful to neighboring benign and/or beneficial insect species (such as pollinators). The sterilant is the first in its class and has benefits over other outdoor biting mosquito technologies such as larvicides, which require identification and access to the mosquito breeding grounds and confer only temporary effects. This biopesticide can be used to help eradicate malaria transmission in developing nations, control the threat of other mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile virus, and manage pests at the home of the general consumer.",

    "ip_description": "This program offers the next generation of cholesterol screening. Current practice of measuring total HDL level in serum does not reflect the patient\u2019s true cardiovascular risk. Available cholesterol diagnostics offer imperfect estimations of CVD risk because they measure the total lipoprotein rather than the good and bad functional types. Harvard\u2019s proprietary platform offers direct measures of disease relevant HDL subclasses and combines them into a personalized index that more accurately predicts individual risk that can provide significant value in treatment decision. Lipoprotein subtypes defined by their protein cargo are the active species protecting against or contributing to CVD. As demonstrated by Dr. Sacks in several epidemiological studies, lipoprotein apoC-III is a potentially important modifier of HDL function and the presence of apoCIII in HDL is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease risk. This new assay will detect patients at risk of cardiovascular events that are not detected by current methods. For example, this assay will correctly identify individuals here-to-fore misclassified as low-risk due to their high overall HDL as being at elevated risk if they have a high proportion of CVD risk associated apoC-III-containing HDL. In addition, the information of this assay can help segregate populations responsive to ApoCIII targeted drugs or certain HDL increasing drugs. The Sacks lab has developed and optimized a rapid assay for measuring the concentration of HDL with apoC-III using a modified ELISA method.

The inhibition of GSK-3b has dramatic morphogenic effects during the early development of numerous organisms, including humans, Dictyostelium, sea urchins, zebrafish, and Xenopus. In each case, components of the assay mixture (described below) are provided exogenously to a cell by microinjection and scored for their respective phenotypes. The invention is a simple and efficient cell-based assay that allows for quick and easy determination of novel GSK-3b inhibitors. In brief, a mixture comprising GSK-3, a source of phosphate, GSK-3 substrate, and assay buffer in the presence or absence of the test compound is measured for the level of phosphorylation of a known GSK-3 substrate. A lower level of phosphorylation of the GSK-3 substrate in the presence of the test compound compared with the level of phosphorylation of the GSK-3 substrate in the absence of the test compound indicates that the test compound is a GSK-3 inhibitor. The system utilizes diverse biological readouts in order to monitor a test compounds activity against GSK-3b. Those compounds exhibiting the expected phenotype are then tested in an in vitro assay for their ability to inhibit GSK-3b phosphorylation on a known substrate. The cell lysates from these assays are readily tested and quantified using any GSK-3b immunoassay kits. A next generation method has been invented for the discovery of lead compounds in the treatment of GSK-3b-related disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Lithium exhibits numerous physiological effects in animals. For example, lithium mimics insulin action by stimulating glycogen synthesis and is remarkably effective for the treatment of mania in many human patients. Research over the years has demonstrated that lithium administers these effects, in part, through the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3b), an enzyme involved in the regulation of glycogen synthesis and cell fate determination in diverse organisms such as humans, Dictyostelium, Drosophila melanogaster, and Xenopus laevis. But lithium treatment in humans is also accompanied by several serious side effects, such as tremors, renal dysfunction, thyroid abnormalities, and birth defects. Additionally, lithium is not administered to patients having significant renal or cardiovascular disease, severe debilitation or dehydration, and sodium depletion due to a risk of disease exasperations. Given these problems, it is imperative to discover other drugs that can inhibit GSK3 in the same manner as lithium but without the toxic side effects.",

The class of compounds utilized for the design of the subject SPECT agents is the 8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octanes (tropanes). Potency and selectivity has been engineered into this class by careful selection of three dimensional asymmetry of the parent molecules. Two lead compounds, Technepine and Fluoratec, have been demonstrated to label the dopamine transporter in dopamine neurons in non-human primates and have proved highly promising.\n\nCertain neurological disease, such as Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), are characterized by the compromised status of dopamine producing neurons in the striatum of the brain. The progression of PD is accompanied by a decrease in dopamine neurons. ADHD has been demonstrated to be accompanied by an increase in dopamine transporter (DAT) levels located on dopamine neurons. Therefore, a measure of the status of dopamine neurons can provide a window on the quantitative diagnosis of both PD and ADHD.\nThe preferred modality for evaluation of neuronal activity at the receptor or transporter level is the ultra-sensitive technique of measuring a radio emitter localized at the actual region of interest. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) are well-accepted techniques in clinical use around the world.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a novel method for determining--in less than 24 hours--enantiomeric ratios, percent conversions, and absolute configurations of all members of a chemical library containing at least 10,000 reaction products. Reaction mixtures are immobilized on a surface and then combined with fluorescent identification reagents that react at different rates with products of different chirality. Reaction products are analyzed simply by measuring their fluorescence. Reaction microarrays allow researchers to identify products with high enantiomeric excess from libraries of thousands of reaction mixtures in hours rather than weeks. About 0.02 nmoles of product from each reaction is arrayed and immobilized on a 1x3-inch glass slide. A large excess of identification reagent can be used to drive the reaction to completion, and the chip can be easily rinsed clean. Because of the small amounts of product immobilized on the chip surface, 100 equivalents of identification reagent amounts to only about 0.3 mg for a 10,800-reaction slide, minimizing the costs of analysis. Since reaction microarrays are used to analyze reaction products, they are amenable to standard catalysis discovery methods that involve the variation of ligand structure, reaction conditions, and additives, as well as to combinatorial discovery methods. Furthermore, reaction microarrays employ the same instrumentation as DNA microarrays, and therefore benefit from the constant improvements made in robotic arraying, contact printing, and laser scanning. While combinatorial chemistry has been successfully applied to the problem of chiral catalyst discovery, its utility is severely hampered by the lack of rapid, high-throughput screens for enantiomeric purity. Current methods require weeks to screen the products of 10,000 reactions. As a consequence, chemical companies face an increasing need for high throughput methods capable of efficiently producing enantiomerically pure products. According to a study by the market research firm Frost and Platt, the worldwide market for chiral fine chemicals sold as single enantiomers is expected to grow at a rate of 13.2% annually; sales were up from $6.63 billion in 2000 to $16 billion in 2007.",

This increases the frequency at which novel sequences are generated, allowing a more efficient and complete exploration of nucleic acid and protein diversity. NRR is a simple method that diversifies proteins in ways that are difficult or impossible to achieve by existing methods. Studies have shown that NRR could drive the production of hybrid enzymes with activity greater than those hybrids formed by traditional DNA shuffling. The implementation of protein NRR is straightforward, enabling starting DNA to be converted into a diversified library in about 1 day. In addition to applications for evolving proteins, NRR is useful for evolving nucleic acids with catalytic or binding (aptamer) activities.\n\nComparison of diversification methods for nucleic acid evolution Starting with parental sequences, pure SELEX enriches active sequences. Error-prone PCR yields parental sequences with point mutations. Homologous recombination methods, such as DNA shuffling, allow crossovers between sequences only in regions of homology. Nonhomologous random recombination allows many other changes, including random crossovers between any sequences, repetition, reordering, reorienting, elimination of subsequences, or any combination of these changes.\n\nThe NRR method for proteins One or more parental genes are digested with DNase I. Fragments are blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, size-selected, and ligated under conditions that favor intermolecular ligation. Two hairpin sequences are added in a defined stoichiometry to the ligation reaction to generate recombined products of the desired average size. The ends of the hairpins are removed by restriction digestion, and the PCR-amplified pool is cloned for protein expression and selection.\n\n### Applications\n\nProtein engineering by laboratory directed molecular evolution has proven useful in conferring desired properties upon a wide variety of commercially important biomolecules. Successful evolution requires the efficient exploration of sequence space to locate molecules encoding the desired properties. Previous methods of introducing diversity include whole-genome mutagenesis, error-prone PCR, random cassette mutagenesis, and DNA shuffling.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a microfluidic array apparatus and a method of performing multiple analyses on multiple samples simultaneously, utilizing nanoliter volumes of reagents. It has two embodiments, the first consists of N microfluidic channels, perhaps in a parallel array, in fluidic contact with N' microfluidic channels, perhaps parallel and orthogonal to the N channels, making NxN' contact points where analyses can occur. Contact is controlled by use of membranes, or other dividers, at the contact points so that diffusional mixing predominates and little convectional mixing occurs. One set of channels could consist of N samples (biological, environmental, etc.) and the other set could carry N' reagents (enzymes, antibody conjugates, etc. perhaps in stationary gels) to perform N' analyses on the N samples. The invention is further described in Anal. Chem. 2001, 73, 5207-5213. The second embodiment is an apparatus and method for performing a miniaturized, serially diluted immunoassay for measuring multiple antigens or multiple antibodies in small volumes of liquid in one experiment. Serial dilution of sera, a ubiquitous and tedious procedure, is done automatically by this invention using combinations of microfluidic channels which mix the sera and buffer (utilizing a proprietary mixer, see PCT/US02/23462). The microfluidic channels containing the serially diluted sera are brought into contact with a series of membranes containing antigens that react with the target antibodies. See published PCT application PCT/US02/26459 for further details. This invention could be the basis for low cost bioassays performed in doctor's offices, at home, in the factory and by first responders in emergencies.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The invention is a novel synthetic pathway to the generation of nonpeptidic ligands for the mu opioid class of G-protein coupled receptors. The system uses stereochemical variation and acyclic geometric stereocontrol to generate diversity among its members. The template structure (shown in 2 below) utilized to generate the stereodiversity is based upon the ligand for the mu opioid receptor (MOR), the tetrapeptide endomorphin-2. The dense array of stereocenters in 2 combined with the rigidifying olefin generates the geometric diversity. Sixteen stereoisomers of 2 were screened for competitive binding to MOR. The stereoisomer with the highest affinity exhibited a Ki of 8.8 nM, a value within an order of magnitude of the Ki measured for endomorphin-2. Moreover, several compounds demonstrated a 107-600-fold selectivity for MOR over other opioid receptors, such as the delta opioid receptor (DOR) and kappa opioid receptor (KOR). Current peptidomimetic combinatorial strategies use a single fixed scaffold that attaches varied side chains to a rigid, cyclic scaffold. Although these libraries incorporate a large amount of structural diversity, the single fixed scaffold limits the amount of functional diversity. This novel platform technology offers diversification through extensive stereochemical diversification. The small molecule libraries have exhaustive variation at every sp3-hybridized center. The system is not limited to the synthesis of libraries of peptide mimics-encompasses the broader concept of providing any collection (peptidomimetics and non-peptidomimetics) of chemical compounds having stereodiversity. The monomers can also be obtained in high yield. Although peptides have shown some promise in clinical trials as therapeutic agents, their success has largely been limited by several factors, including rapid degradation by peptidases, poor cell permeability, and a lack of binding specificity resulting from conformational inflexibility. Science has overcome these limitations with the advance of peptidomimetics--a system for the production of modified chemical compounds capable of mimicking the structural and or functional properties of peptides. A fertile ground for such efforts lies in the discovery of ligands for nervous system receptors that mediate the sensation of pain. Researchers at Harvard University have developed a novel approach to generate nonpeptidic ligands to a key receptor involved in pain relief, the mu opioid receptor (MOR). This approach has far-reaching implications for the discovery of next-generation therapeutics for the treatment of pain. The peptidomimetic mu receptor ligands generated as a result of this synthetic platform are lead compounds for the treatment of pain. The market for pain therapeutics is very large. In one example, there are 45 million Americans that suffer from chronic headaches, while nearly 6 million reported case of chest pain.",

    "ip_description": "Researchers in the laboratory of Professor David Liu have used directed evolution techniques to evolve an intein-based molecular switch that transduces binding of a small molecule into the activation of an arbitrary protein of interest. To create the switch, the researchers replaced the dispensable homing endonuclease domain of the RecA intein with the ligand-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor (ER) to yield an (N)-interin-ER-intein(C) fusion. This chimeric intein was then fused into a number of protein (extein) contexts to facilitate rounds of positive (negative) selection for ligand-dependent splicing in the presence (absence) of the synthetic small molecule 4-hydroxytamoxifen. The switch was shown to be effective in multiple protein contexts in both yeast and mammalian cells. The researchers recently reported second-generation evolved inteins that exhibit substantially improved splicing yields and kinetics over previously reported first generation inteins.\n\nThese new ligand-dependent inteins represent effective and broadly applicable tools for the small-molecule-triggered, posttranslational modulation of protein activities in living systems including mammalian cells, and for the _in vivo_ activation of intein-fused therapeutic proteins.\n\nIntein Evolution Approach. Overview of the directed evolution strategy used to isolate improved small-molecule-dependent inteins.\n\n### Applications\n\nArtificial molecular switches that modulate protein activities in response to synthetic small molecules would serve as tools for exerting temporal and dose-dependent control over protein function. Self-splicing protein elements known as inteins, which are able to catalyze their excision out of a single polypeptide and leave behind precisely ligated flanking sequences (exteins), are attractive starting points for the creation of such switches because their insertion into a protein blocks the target protein\u2019s function until splicing occurs, and because they are able to rapidly splice out of a wide variety of extein contexts.

More specifically, it involves the design of an error-correcting circuit (ECC) as applied to high density and low latency memories, especially NOR Flash and DRAM. More generally, this can also be in any type of digital memory or digital communication channel. As semiconductor memories get smaller and smaller, memory cells are subject to higher rates of manufacturing defects and soft errors. Correction or manufacturing defects is achieved through extensive testing and use of redundant memory cells to replace defective memory cells. Soft errors are very difficult to detect and correct and only the simplest parity check codes have been implemented. The cost in terms of delay time and computational complexity are barriers to the implementation of ECC.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The invention describes new methods and apparatus for implementing stable self-starting and self-sustaining electrical nonlinear pulse (e.g., soliton, cnoidal wave, or quasi-soliton) oscillators. In one embodiment, a nonlinear pulse oscillator is implemented as a closed loop structure that comprises a nonlinear transmission line, a high-pass filter, and a nonlinear amplifier configured to provide a self-adjusting gain as a function of the average voltage of the oscillator signal (i.e., the propagating pulses).\n\nIn another aspect, an adaptive bias control technique is employed together with the nonlinear gain functionality to ensure robust, stable operation of the oscillator. The implementation of a nonlinear amplifier with adaptive bias control may be viewed conceptually as an electric circuit analog of a saturable absorber, which is configured to effectively reduce distortion to pulses propagating in the oscillator, reject perturbations to the system, and ensure the selection and propagation of a single mode.\n\nIn yet another aspect, one or more high pass filters employed in the oscillator may be particularly configured to facilitate single mode operation. For example, according to one embodiment, the cut-off frequency of one or more high pass filters is particularly selected so as to prohibit collisions of multiple different-amplitude nonlinear pulses. The filter design takes advantage of the fact that collisions of multiple different amplitude solitons or quasi-solitons tend to skew the frequency spectrum of the oscillator toward higher power at lower frequencies. Accordingly, by designing the high pass filter to appropriately attenuate lower frequency spectrum components characteristic of soliton collisions, such collisions are effectively precluded from forming in the oscillator.\n\n### Applications\n\nConventional traveling wave oscillators that require high-speed clock signals generally employ a linear transmission line over which sinusoidal waves are propagated. In such systems, linear amplifiers are employed to overcome resistive losses present in the transmission line so as to maintain the signal strength of the traveling sinusoidal wave and permit oscillation. While such linear oscillator systems have enjoyed wide acceptance in the communications industry, system designers have expressed a willingness to consider nonlinear approaches.\n\nImproved nonlinear pulse oscillator methods and apparatus may be employed in the areas of high-speed electronics, electrical and optical communication systems, information encoding and decoding, pulsed power technology, spectroscopy, and neural networks.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "A transgenic reporter system consisting of a tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre recombinase (Cre-ERTM) that can be used for recombination-mediated modulation of gene activity in the developing mouse embryo. Using the enhancer of the Wnt1 gene to restrict the expression of Cre-ERTM to the embryonic neural tube, we found that a single injection of tamoxifen into pregnant mice induced Cre-mediated recombination within the embryonic central nervous system, thereby activating expression of a reporter gene. Induction is ligand dependent, rapid and efficient. The invention demonstrates that tamoxifen-inducible recombination can be used to effectively modify gene function in the mouse embryo.\n\nThe construction of the system was performed as follows: To express cre within the WntI expression domain, the cDNA for Cre was placed under the control of the Wnt enhancer. Transgenic mouse strains that expressed this construct were mated with the R170 reporter line to determine whether Cre-mediated activation of the reporter could take place within the WntI expression domain. In embryos carrying both transgenes, b-galactosidase activity is detected within the midbrain by 8.5 post coitum (dpc) and the complete pattern of expression by 11.5 dpc. Next, Cre fusion proteins were generated using the hormone-binding domain of a mutant mouse estrogen receptor (Cre-ERTM) and placed under the regulation of the WntI enhancer. To determine if recombination occurred in the absence of ligand, we crossed stem cell line R170 and Cre-ERTM and stained for b-galactosidase activity at 11.5 dpc. All embryos determined by genotyping to be carrying both transgenes showed a staining pattern that was indistinguishable from embryos carrying only the reporter, whether pregnant mice were uninjected or injected with corn oil. When the pregnant mice from this intercross were injected intraperitoneally with 1.0 mg tamoxifen (TM) per day for four consecutive days (from 7.5 to 10.5 dpc) prior to collection at 11.5 dpc a strong and reproducible b-galactosidase staining was obtained in the WntI pattern in all embryos carrying both transgenes.\n\nThe reporter can be activated within the WntI domain, and activation - which requires intragenic recombination, transcription and translation - occurred in less than 12 hours and is active from 8.0 days dpc in the neural plate of the mouse embryo.\n\n### Applications\n\nThe ability to generate specific genetic modifications in mice provides a powerful approach to assess gene function. As such systems allowing conditional genetic modification have been developed; for example, inducible forms of the Cre recombinase from P1 phage have been generated that can catalyze intramolecular recombination between target recognition sequences (loxP sites) in response to ligand. However, when genetic modifications have been generated in the germ line, the resulting phenotype often only reflects the first time a gene has an influence on a particular biological process. As a consequence it is imperative to develop new models that can help understand better how these genes function.\n\nWnt1-Cre tamoxifen-inducible recombination can be used to modulate gene activity in developing mouse embryos to study neural development.",

    "ip_description": "The invention is a novel engineering method for generation of freestanding 2-D and 3-D tissue structures. Biopolymers (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids or combinations thereof) are deposited onto a transitional polymer surface with a patterning technique that allows for nanometer-to-millimeter-scale spatial positioning. In one example, the transitional polymer layer dissolves or switches states to release the biopolymer structure(s). The free-standing biopolymer structure(s) is then seeded with functionally active cells that become spatially organized according to the imprinted pattern. Alternatively, the predetermined pattern of the biopolymer scaffold is seeded with functionally active cells that become spatially organized according to the imprinted pattern. Subsequently, the transitional polymer layer dissolves or switches states to release the biopolymer structure(s) and cells together as an integrated, free-standing construct. The predetermined pattern upon which the cells attach and the cell type used to seed the film/polymer scaffold depends upon the desired tissue type. For example, smooth muscle cells are used for blood vessels and other internal organs, striated muscle cell for skeletal muscle tissue, and cardiac (cardiomyocytes) for heart tissue. Alternatively, the structure is assembled in an iterative manner by which a scaffold is made, seeded with cells, and stacked with another scaffold, which in turn is seeded with cells. This seed/stack process is repeated to construct a 3-D structure. In some cases different cell types are seeded together or sequentially, e.g, for construction of neural tissue, glial cells are seeded and then neurons. The polymer film will enable surgical instruments to detect cancerous tissues with molecular specificity and sensitivity. In one application, a catheter will be capable of providing point of care tumor diagnostics by oncologists. Other clinical applications may leverage the versatile polymer films to regulate analyte concentrations in solution or provide localized delivery of drugs or analytes, while non-clinical applications may generate label-free electrochemical CMOS microarrays and proteomic chips.",

    "ip_description": "The invention describes a general and scalable, low temperature method involving bubble expansion of homogeneous epoxy suspensions of nanowires and carbon nanotubes to produce large area films. The nanowires and carbon nanotubes are well aligned in the films, and the density can be readily controlled by starting suspension concentrations. Moreover, the average nanowire separation can be systematically controlled by adjusting the loading percentage of nanowires in the bubble solution. The nanomaterial-embedded bubble films can be conformally transferred to a variety of substrates such as single crystal wafers, large flexible plastic sheets, highly-curved surfaces and also suspended across open frames. The bubble process produces very uniform film thickness of each bubble. The simplicity, generality, and potential to extend to much larger area films offers substantial promise for applications of one-dimensional nanowires and carbon nanotubes. This technique could offer substantial savings over traditional high-vacuum approaches to deposition. The generality of this approach has been further shown with carbon nanotubes. The resulting single-walled nanotubes and multiple-walled nanotube films are distinct from previously reported filtration films, buckypapers, or yarned sheets. Filtration usually produces multiple layers overlapped nanotubes, while the single-walled nanotube films obtained through the bubble expansion method consist of a single-layer of ordered nanotubes. For making device arrays, individual nanotubes with controlled separation and alignment are more desired. The substitution of different nanowires or nanotubes enabled by this approach can be very attractive for creating different functional nanosystems with functionalities such as light-emitting diode arrays and logic/memory arrays. This approach can be applicable to other types of nanostructures (e.g. nanoparticles) to produce very large scale thin film embedded with well-ordered nanomaterials. This approach is general to other polymer/solvent systems, not limiting to current Epoxy/THF. For example, it is possible to prepare BBFs by using water/ethanol polymers (such as polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) and etc.), or photolithography-compatible polymers (e.g. SU-8 series photopolymer), which could be important to develop nanodevices for biological research, life sciences, etc. Applications include: Manufacturing different types of nanosystems, Nanowire field-effect transistor devices and multifunctional coatings, Continuous films production.",

    "ip_description": "Patterning surfaces to create some function is a core technology propelling our technical society. The most important such technology, photolithography, is used to create IC chips with nanoscale features. It is also the most expensive with fab capital costs greater than several billion dollars. Not all surface patterning needs require nanoscale resolution. Soft lithography, pioneered by George Whitesides, can create patterns on a surface in the microscale using a suite of techniques easily carried out in an ordinary lab or factory environment with capital costs in the thousands of dollars. Soft lithography is beginning to be used to make commercial products. The current soft lithography invention is useful for creating patterns of metals and semiconductors on a surface with a resolution on the border of the nano- and microscale. The invention takes advantage of a property of a polymer like polyacrylic acid (PAA), which is water soluble when its counterion is monocationic (i.e, Na+1) and not crosslinking and insoluble in water when its counterion is a doubly charged and is crosslinking (i.e., Zn+2). A template of surface microfluidic channels, in a desired pattern, is impressed on a soluble PAA layer and Zn+2 solution in the channels converts soluble PAA into insoluble PAA impregnated with zinc ions in the pattern of the microfluidic template. Removing the template and washing with water leaves the zinc ion impregnated PAA in the pattern of the template. Now one can use this patterned surface as a template for chemical conversion to zinc nanoparticles (by reduction) or to form compounds of zinc such as zinc sulfide, a semiconductor. The PAA can be removed by oxygen plasma. Other metals such as Al, Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Pd, La, Gd, Ho, Pb and U can be used. Nanoparticles can be used as nucleation sites for the growth of patterned microstructures. Different channels can carry different metal solutions allowing complex structures with more than one metal to be produced. The microfluidic template is made using well-known and inexpensive soft lithography techniques, such as described in the publication entitled, 'Microfluidic Devices Fabricated in Poly(Dimethylsiloxane)for Biological Studies Electrophoresis', 2003, 24, 3563-3576.

    "ip_description": "A bipartite, quantitatively designed protein having two discrete ligands and a linker; one ligand having the ability to strongly bind to a particular cell, the other having the ability to affect a target only when the previous ligand binds. For many years, researchers have tried to construct bipartite proteins with properties that derive from each moieties parental source. A universal problem with this kind of approach is that the likelihood of off-target effects as the drug travels through the body is high. Because reaction rates are often enhanced by reduction of space between two substrates, researchers thought that an initial rapid binding reaction to one cell surface protein could drive a second, weak interaction on the same cell surface, driven solely by reduction in space. It is believed that it is possible to tune the binding affinities of both the targeting agent and the activating ligand appropriately, allowing the development of a mutant protein that would show negligible activation on cells expressing just one of the relevant receptors. Proof of principle has been demonstrated using EGF as the targeting agent and IFN?-2a as the ligand and research continues using the same technology for the development of bipartite haemopoietic, asthma, and HIV therapeutics. Applications: Bipartite therapeutics, in addition to the method of quantitative design, is available for worldwide licensing on an exclusive basis.

Unlike typical colloidal silver nanoparticles, where less than 3% of the nanoparticles exhibit optical properties, the present invention is able to produce more than 95% of the nanoparticles with such strong fluorescence. In addition, unlike current state of the art where strong fluorescence and/or Raman enhancement effects are observed for aggregates of nanoparticles, our technology observes the behavior from single nanoparticles.\n\nThe ability to image signal transduction, gene expression and other cellular dynamics depends on fluorescent reporters that can probe local chemical information inside a cell.

A potential solution is to use embryonic stem cells (ESC) as a renewable source of cells carrying the disease genes for the study of disease processes. The Eggan laboratory of Harvard University has successfully developed in vitro models of ALS by differentiating mouse and human ESCs into motor neurons (Di Giorgio et al, 2007; Di Giorgio et al, 2008). These cells show pathogenic properties similar to those observed in ALS patients and in transgenic animals. Both systems will provide an inexhaustible supply of ALS-affected motor neurons for research. Also, they can be developed into high-throughput cell-based assays to screen for small molecules that promote survival of mutant SOD1 motor neurons in motor neuron diseases, such as ALS and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Using the human ESC-based ALS model, the Eggan\u2019s group has discovered that inhibition of signaling through the classic prostaglandin D2 receptor DP1 suppresses the toxic effect of SOD1 glia on motor neurons, hence providing a target for developing new methods of treatment for ALS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting the upper and lower motor neurons of patients. Approximately 5,600 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with ALS each year. The incidence of ALS is two per 100,000 people, and it is estimated that as many as 30,000 Americans may have the disease at any given time. 80% of patients die within five years following diagnosis, where normally death is due to respiratory failure. To this day, there is no effective treatment for the ALS; the only drug currently approved by the FDA is a NMDA receptor antagonist (riluzole) that increases the rate of survival by 6 months.

After 4 days treatment with ILV alone, 27% of HUES 8\u2013derived cells were positively stained by Pdx1 antibody. In mouse ESCs that had been induced to form definitive endoderm (DE), after treatment with 300 nM ILV, the percentage of Pdx1-expressing cells increased from 4% to 50%. Titration of ILV from 20 nM to 5 mM showed that it functions in a dose-dependent manner. Effector concentration for half-maximum response (EC50) = 142 nM; with the highest efficacy and no detectable toxicity at 300 nM. ILV acts synergistically with FGF10, a growth factor involves in pancreatic development. When a population of HUES 8-E cells was treated with a combination of 300 nM ILV and 50 ng/ml FGF10, after 4 days culture, 46% of the cells were positively stained by Pdx1 antibody. A possible application of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is to generate new insulin-producing beta cells for cell replacement therapy for diabetics. Stepwise protocol is being explored to differentiate hESCs into functional beta cells. An essential step is the generation of pancreatic progenitors -- cells that express Pdx1 and produce all the cell types of the pancreas. As an alternative to using coculture with other cell types and growth factors as inducers, the laboratory of Douglas Melton uses cell-permeable small molecules as a means to control in vitro differentiation of hESCs. Small-molecule inducers would be less expensive, more easily controlled and possibly more efficient than growth factors in directing differentiation. The Melton's group has identified that (-)-indolactam V (ILV) activates PKC signaling and directs the pancreatic specification of hESCs that have already been committed to the endoderm lineage.",

    "ip_description": "Dr. Prentiss\u2019 lab has developed a new cell sorting technology based on microfluidics. This technique enables manipulation of non-magnetic micro- and nano-entities, including cells, immersed in magnetic fluids. Compared to existing MACS and FACS cell sorters, this technique uses simple equipment that is significantly and measurable faster, cheaper, and easier to use than MACS and FACS cell sorters. MACS cell sorting relies on magnetic tagging of antigens on cells. When the cell mixture is passed through a strong magnetic field, the cells expressing the antigens are captured and the other cells are released. FACS cell sorting uses multiple lasers to detect and measure the different light scattering and fluorescent characteristics of cells, one-by-one, and then physically separates the cells based on the cells fluorescent measurement. Dr. Prentiss\u2019 technique uses magnetic fields to separate cells, greatly simplifying the cell sorting process and equipment required to support it. In addition to simplifying the process, this new technology speeds up cell sorting rates. FACS can sort cells in speeds ranging from 10,000 cells per second up to about 50,000 cells per second (depending on cell suspension, cell size, and other factors); whereas MACS can sort cells up to speeds of 10 million cells per second. Because the new non-magnetic cell sorting technology is based on microfluidics, it can be easily and cost-effectively scaled to process billions of cells per second. Throughout the biological, medical, and pharmaceutical fields, cell sorting is used for research and some clinical practices. In research, cell sorting is already used to count, characterize, and analyze living cells and their particles. In clinical practices, it is mostly reserved for diagnostics. Cell sorting could be used much more extensively, but the existing technologies, fluorescently activated cell sorting (FACS\u2122) and magnetically activated cell sorting (MACS\u00ae), are expensive. Usually, cell sorting equipment is limited to a single lab within a large institution, such as a university, and that lab sorts cells for other researchers and clinicians. Dr. Prentiss\u2019 team developed a new cell sorting technology that could dramatically expand the availability of cell sorting equipment, and thereby the use of cell sorting. The new process is orders of magnitude faster, better, and less expensive than FACS and MACS. If cell sorting cell equipment could become more commonly available, it could be make many applications such as these more available and viable: \u2022 Biological research \u2013 Identify and characterize cells and cell populations in complex systems in molecular biology, protein engineering, plant biology, and marine biology; and prepare pure sources of stem cells. \u2022 Medical diagnostics \u2013 Determine if there are cancer cells in a patient\u2019s system (to head off cancer metastasis); precisely diagnose leukemia and lymphomas using blood plasma samples instead of bone marrow tests; analyze tissue specimens from patients; and analyze human DNA and determine if there are risks for hereditary diseases. \u2022 Clinical practice \u2013 Develop sources of purified cells to treat neurological degenerative disease through transplantation; improve understanding of tumor immunology and treatment by evaluating pure samples of tumor cells; and rescue healthy cells and re-introduce them into patients undergoing chemotherapy to reduce the side effects of chemotherapeutics. \u2022 Drug discovery \u2013 Isolate and grow living tissue for drug experimentation.",

    "ip_number": "3211",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "This platform consists of an array of surface-modified vertical silicon nanowires that have been chemically grown or etched on a wafer and to which virtually any kind of bioactive species (drug, protein, nucleic acid, nanoparticles) may be attached by covalent or electrostatic means. When cells are plated on the surface of the array, they are penetrated by the functionalized nanowires, and the bioactive material is thus efficiently delivered into the cytosol of the cells. Since the cells remain viable after penetration, the effects of the delivered material on the cells can be monitored over time.\n\nBy optimizing the cell-nanowire interface through the use of novel surface chemistry and the precise control over nanowire density, diameter, and height, investigators in the laboratory of Professor Hongkun Park at Harvard University have created a platform suitable for delivering a wide range of materials (including small molecules, nanoparticles, siRNAs, and proteins) into living cells in a highly efficiently, massively parallel, arrayed fashion. There are three general steps involving to implement the procedure:\n\n1. The nanowires are fabricated by either growing them from a precursor material on the surface of a patterned substrate, or by etching the structures out of a substrate material from the top down.\n\n2. The surface of the nanowires is then chemically treated to facilitate their electrostatic linkage to the compound of interest. (Covalent linkage strategies may also be employed.)\n\n3. The compound of interest is then tethered to the nanowire by pipetting a few uLs of a solution containing the compound atop the nanowires. Microarraying techniques may also be used for the multiplex deposition of an assortment of molecular species. Once the solvent evaporates, the nanowire wafer may be used immediately or stored until needed.\n\n4. Cells are then plated on the nanowire surface. As they settle, they are impaled by the wires (typically within an hour) and the electrostatically linked agent detaches from the wires and is thus released into the cell cytosol.\n\nThis single platform has been shown to be able to deliver small molecules, nanoparticles, RNAs, peptides, and proteins, into a number of primary and clonal cell with an efficiency greater than 95%. It should be noted that the Park laboratory has been able to mass-produce the wires on six-inch silicon wafers using a technique that could easily be implemented by any semiconductor foundry. The high-throughput, low-cost production of these silicon wafer arrays using widely available semiconductor processing should enable the wide adoption and rapid commercialization of this technology.\n\n### Applications\n\nExisting strategies for delivering exogenous materials into cells (e.g., viral vectors, physio-chemical means, or microinjection) are limited either by the range of chemical and biological species that each can deliver, or by the efficiency or throughput of the delivery. While there have been previous efforts to use nanostructured materials to introduce bioactive species into cells, they too have been inefficient and generally limited to the delivery of genetic material. The potential to deliver a wide range of molecules at sites of one\u2019s choosing lends itself to a broad variety of implementations and applications, including the following:\n\n1. Massive, parallel screening for drug discovery: the cellular effects of many proteins (proteomics), siRNAs (knockdown efficacy), and small molecules (drug/antibiotic resistance) may be assayed simultaneously, either singly or in combinations; by perturbing different elements of a particular cellular pathway, the causal relationships between those elements can be discovered.\n\n2. Cell-based ADME/Tox assays: the concentration-dependent effects of a particular protein, drug, and/or combinations can be studied in cell-based assays.\n\n3. Derivation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells: the platform is suitable for efficiently delivering (and discovering) molecules capable of reprogramming adult cells into iPS cells.\n\n4. Designer cell networks and disease models: the platform can be used to construct complex cellular systems, such as synaptic pairs of differentially perturbed neurons for modeling neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n5. Assays of epigenetic factors: the platform could be used to discover molecules that usefully affect the differentiation and development of any set of cells (e.g., stem cells, iPS cells, or differentiated tissues), and then further used to generate cells of a particular lineage for use in cell-based therapies.",

This simple procedure generates durable 3D fiber-supported gels with defined numbers and densities of cells with easily controlled lateral dimensions and with thickness defined by the paper. Individual layers can be easily manipulated and, if desired, stacked to form thicker multilayer constructs with dimensions that mimic the environment of cells in tissues, where the diffusion limited distribution of oxygen, nutrients, metabolites, and signaling molecules come into play. The stacked constructs may be designed to exhibit desired spatial distributions of cells, and can be easily destacked to analyze cell structure and function within physical sections of these 3D tissue-like structures without requiring optical or histological sectioning.\n\nThis paper-based cell-culture platform is readily integrated with cell-based assays and high-throughput screens for drug discovery. For example, multiple layers of paper can be incorporated into standard microwell plates by assembling multiple layers of paper, 96-zone plates, and commercially available bottomless 96-well plates. The platform could also be combined with existing technologies for the synthesis of chemical libraries on paper to provide for entirely new screening strategies. Finally, the platform is well-suited to co-culture screening strategies and tissue engineering experiments.\n\nFundamental investigations of human biology, and the development of therapeutics, commonly rely on 2D cell-culture systems that do not accurately recapitulate the structure, function, or physiology of living tissues. Systems for 3D cultures exist but do not replicate the spatial distributions of oxygen, metabolites, and signaling molecules found in tissues. Microfabrication can create architecturally complex scaffolds for 3D cell cultures that circumvent some of these limitations; unfortunately, these approaches require instrumentation not commonly available in biology laboratories.\n\nResearchers in the laboratory of George Whitesides have developed a simple and versatile strategy for controlling the distribution of cultured cells in 3D by fabrication of mono- or multilaminate structures of fiber-supported hydrogels, where each layer is composed of chromatography paper impregnated with an extracellular matrix hydrogel containing living cells.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are key mediators of peripheral tolerance that can actively suppress effector T-cells, inhibit inflammation and mediate self-tolerance. Unlike naturally occurring Tregs (nTregs) which develop in the thymus, adaptive/induced (iTregs) develop in the periphery from na\u00efve CD4+ Foxp3- T cells. In the presence of TGF-b, na\u00efve T cells can be induced to express the transcription factor Foxp3 and become iTreg. These TGF-b induced Tregs potently suppress effector T cells.\n\nThe programmed death 1 receptor (PD-1) is upregulated on T cells upon their activation and highly expressed on Tregs. Its ligand, PD-L1, is expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells, T cells, and a variety of nonhematopoietic cells including vascular endothelium, and at sites of immune privilege including the placenta and the eye. Interactions between PD-1 and PD-L help to regulate the balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals needed for effective immunity and the maintenance of self-tolerance. In particular, this pathway is known to regulate peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cell tolerance, and is a key mediator of T cell dysfunction (\u201cexhaustion\u201d) during chronic viral infection.\n\n**Novel methods for inducing Tregs**\n\nResearchers in the Sharpe laboratory demonstrated that the PD-1:PD-L pathway is necessary for promoting iTreg development and sustaining Treg function. They further developed novel methods for inducing and maintaining Tregs by targeting PD-1 expressed on the surface of CD4+ T cells. Their findings are based on several lines of evidence:\n\n*   The capacity of APCs to convert na\u00efve CD4+ T cells to iTregs is severely reduced when APCs are deficient in PD-L1\n*   Treating na\u00efve CD4+ T cells with PD-L1-coated beads (along with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28) stimulates iTreg development in vitro\n*   Culturing iTregs with PD-L1-coated beads increases Foxp3 expression and enhances the suppressive function of iTreg\n*   PD-L1 and TGF- b have synergistic roles in regulating FoxP3+ iTreg development\n*   There is a marked reduction in iTreg conversion following transfer of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells into mice deficient in PD-L1 and PD-L2 when compared to control mice\n*   Transfer of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells into mice deficient in PD-L1 and PD-L2 rapidly produces a fatal inflammatory phenotype\n\nThis technology is available for worldwide, exclusive licensing and/or a collaborative research program with the Sharpe laboratory.\n\n### Applications\n\nThe goal of Treg cell-based therapies is to reduce inappropriate or undesired immune responses, such as the immune response to self (autoimmune disease) or the immune response to transplanted organs and tissues (transplant rejection). Agonists that target the cell surface receptor PD-1, such as its natural ligand PD-L1 or related agonists, are a promising new strategy to increase and or/maintain Treg cell activity in vivo, and may be useful for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and prevention of transplant rejection. PD-L1 agonists provide a novel means to sustain and enhance the suppressive function of Treg function in vivo while concomitantly suppressing the expansion and functions of activated T effector cells.",

    "ip_number": "3326",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Researchers in the laboratory of Professor David Liu have developed a platform that enables the continuous directed evolution of gene-encoded molecules that can be linked to protein production in E. coli. During phage-assisted continuous evolution (\u201cPACE\u201d), successfully evolving genes are transferred from host cell to host cell through a modified M13 filamentous bacteriophage life cycle by linking desired activity to the expression of protein III (pIII; encoded by gene III), and thus to the production of infectious progeny phage. To accomplish this, gene III was deleted from the phage vector and inserted it into an \u201caccessory plasmid\u201d (AP) present in the E. coli host cells. The production of pIII from the AP is dependent upon the activity of the evolving gene(s) on the phage vector and in the absence of this activity is insufficient to support the production of infectious phage. Phage vectors able to induce sufficient production of pIII from the AP will therefore propagate and persist in a continuously diluted lagoon, while phage vectors unable to induce pIII will be washed out over time. Because pIII expression level determines the rate of infectious phage production, the progeny of a phage encoding a mutant gene that results in a higher level of pIII production will infect a larger share of host cells relative to the progeny of a phage encoding a less active gene. Mutants with higher activity will therefore experience a selective advantage until pIII levels are sufficient for maximal infectious phage release.\n\nIn principle, PACE is capable of evolving any gene that can be linked to pIII production in E. coli, including activities that influence pIII function at the transcriptional, translational, or post-translational levels. Because a wide variety of functions including DNA binding, RNA binding, protein binding, bond-forming catalysis, and a variety of enzyme activities have been linked to the expression of a reporter protein through n-hybrid and other conditional transcription strategies, PACE can be applied to the evolution of many different activities of interest. To date, the investigators have successfully linked and evolved protein-protein binding, recombinase activity, and RNA polymerase activity to phage infectivity in discrete infection assays by creating variants of the AP that associate each of these activities with pIII production. In the example described in the publication referenced below, the T7 RNA polymerase was evolved to recognize the T3 promoter and to initiate transcripts with nucleotides other than G.\n\nThe PACE system can be assembled entirely from a modest collection of commercially available equipment and does not require the manufacture of any specialized components. PACE proceeds at a rate of several dozen rounds of mutation, selection, and gene replication per day, representing roughly a 100-fold increase over most current protein evolution methods.\n\nOverview of the PACE system: (a) PACE in a single lagoon. Newly arrived host cells are infected with selection phage (SP) encoding library members. Functional library members induce production of pIII from the accessory plasmid (AP) and release progeny capable of infecting new host cells. Non-functional library members do not produce pIII and release only non-infectious progeny. Increased mutagenesis is triggered upon lagoon entry through induction of a mutagenesis plasmid (MP). Host cells flow out of the lagoon on average faster than they can replicate, confining the accumulation of mutations to actively replicating SP. (b) Schematic of the PACE apparatus. Host E. coli cells maintained at constant cell density are continuously fed into the lagoon by peristaltic pump along with chemical inducers at a dilution rate of 1.0-3.2 volumes per hour.\n\n### Applications\n\nProtein engineering by directed evolution has proven useful in conferring desired properties upon a wide variety of biomolecules of interest. However, with current methods, each round of evolution typically requires days or longer, with frequent intervention by the researcher involving discrete cycles of mutagenesis, transformation or in vitro expression, screening or selection, and gene harvesting and manipulation. Since successful evolution is strongly dependent on the total number of rounds performed, the labor- and time-intensive nature of discrete directed evolution cycles limit many laboratory evolution efforts to a modest number of rounds. A more rapid and automated approach to directed evolution is needed.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The new digital data calibration technique allows any pipeline ADC to operate at a speed about 2 bits faster than currently available ADCs. For example, an 8-bit ADC could potentially run at 12 bits, compared to only the 10 bits maximum that might be possibly be achieved today. The increase in speed is a result of when the data calibration is done. Existing ADCs calibrate data twice: initially when the chip is manufactured; and then continually as a background process during data conversion. However, the background calibration takes time and it must interrupt ADC operations. As a result, the full bit potential of an ADC cannot be achieved or maintained. The new calibration technique allows for both the initial and continual calibrations to be done in real time; that is, as the data is converted. By operating in real time, the maximum bit resolution of up to 12 bits can be achieved. Analog to digital converters (ADCs) are most well known for their use in audio and visual products: they convert analog sound and motion data into digital data that can be stored in files. Digital cameras, cellular telephones, wireless data network equipment, audio devices (MP3 players), video devices (DVD players) and high definition television all use ADCs. Less well known, but equally important in their fields, ADCs are used to convert any type of continuous signal into digital data, including measuring voltage and currents, and recording ultrasonic medical images. During conversion, errors can be introduced into the digital data. To minimize errors, the digital data must be continuously calibrated and corrected. Drs. Ham and Sun developed a new calibration technique for ADCs that operate at medium frequencies; also referred to as pipeline ADCs. Audio and video equipment typically use pipeline ADCs. The new calibration technique allows the ADC to generate digital data faster and more accurately than currently available ADCs can. This calibration technique could be used by any ADC maker to improve the performance and reliability of their pipeline converters.",

    "ip_number": "3348",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "To reduce the gap between nominal and worst-case operating voltages, Harvard researchers have developed a \u201cvoltage emergency predictor\u201d that identifies when emergencies are imminent and prevents their occurrence. A voltage emergency predictor anticipates voltage emergencies using \u201cvoltage emergency signatures\u201d (the combination of control flow and microarchitectural events leadings up to them) and throttles machine execution to prevent them. By doing so, the predictor enables chip designers to maximize performance with more aggressive timing margins. The signature-based predictor outperforms previously proposed architecture-centric techniques that rely only on voltage sensors to detect imminent problems and then react to emergencies via throttling. The invention recognizes and tracks patterns of emergency-prone activity to proactively throttle execution well before an emergency can occur. High prediction accuracy is possible, which translates to performance enhancements by reducing otherwise conservative margins. Additionally, the voltage emergency predictor is trained during normal operation and does not require fine tuning based on specifics of the microarchitecture nor the power delivery subsystem, as is the case with reactive sensor-based schemes. The potential market for this technology is manufacturers of semiconductor chips. Power-constrained CMOS designs are making it increasingly difficult for microprocessor designers to cope with power supply noise. As current draw increases and operating voltage decreases, inductive noise threatens the robustness and limits the clock frequency of high-performance processors. Large current swings over small time scales cause large voltage swings in the power-delivery subsystem. A significant drop in supply voltage can cause timing margin violations by slowing down logic circuits. For reliable and correct operation of the processor, voltage emergencies - large voltage swings that violate noise margins - must be avoided. The traditional way to deal with inductive noise is to over-design the processor to tolerate worst-case fluctuations. Unfortunately, the gap between nominal and worst-case operating conditions in modern microprocessor designs is growing. Such conservative operating margins ensure robust operation of the system, but can severely degrade performance due to the lower operating frequencies.",

    "ip_description": "The Walker group has developed novel high throughput assays (HTS) and screened 200,000 compounds at the Institute for Chemistry and Cell Biology (ICCB) at Harvard Medical School, and identified several compound classes/cores that have the properties of OGT inhibitors. To identify other prospective leads, the scientists have evaluated 1400 commercially available compounds containing selected cores for improved OGT inhibition in vitro. So far, the Walker group has identified cell-permeable OGT inhibitors with IC50 values in 1-2 micromolar range, a 50-fold improvement over the original hits. Importantly, the Walker group possesses SAR data and several co-crystal structures of human OGT to guide the design of additional novel compounds.\n\nWalker and collaborators have discovered a link between OGT and cancer cell growth and invasion (Caldwell et al., 2010). They demonstrated that OGT and O-GlcNAc levels are elevated in breast cancer cells. Also, they showed that OGT inhibitor (OGTi) reduces O-GlcNAcation and blocks growth and invasion of MCF-10A-ErbB2 cells in vitro.\n\nIn a landmark study in 2008, Evans and coworkers reported a new mechanism of regulation of OGT. They discovered a unique binding site for phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)trisphosphate (PIP3) that mapped to the C-terminus of OGT. PIP3 is important in several signaling cascades, serving as a second messenger. It was shown that upon insulin stimulation, PIP3 binds to OGT, recruiting it to the plasma membrane. OGT then decorates insulin signaling pathway proteins with sugars, impeding their activity and dampening the insulin response. One of such examples is the inhibition of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AktThr308. Overexpression of OGT in the liver of mice causes insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. Abnormal O-GlcNAc modification of insulin signaling may therefore contribute to insulin resistance, obesity and type-2 diabetes.\n\nIn 2011, the Walker group reported two crystal structures of human OGT, as a binary complex with UDP (2.8\u00c5 resolution; referred to as OGT\u2013UDP) and as a ternary complex with UDP and a well-characterized 14-residue CKII peptide substrate (1.95\u00c5; referred to as OGT\u2013UDP\u2013peptide). The structures provide clues to the enzyme mechanism, show how OGT recognizes target peptide sequences, and reveal the fold of the unique domain between the two halves of the catalytic region.\n\nCurrently under study is a third crystal structure, a co-crystal of a lead OGT inhibitor and human OGT. The data show that the compound inhibits human O-GlcNAc transferase by an unprecedented mechanism.\n\nThe structure information will accelerate the rational design of biological experiments to investigate OGT\u2019s functions. It will also help the design of inhibitors for use as cellular probes and help to assess its potential as a therapeutic target.\n\nOGT- An essential enzyme for nutrient sensing and regulating cellular signaling pathways\n\nThe ability to sense and respond to nutrient levels is critical for the growth of all living systems. In eukaryotes, a major mechanism for nutrient sensing involves the essential protein glycosyltransferase OGT, which senses cellular glucose levels via UDP-GlcNAc concentrations, and responds by dynamically O-GlcNAcylating a wide range of proteins including numerous transcription factors, tumor suppressors, kinases, phosphatase and histone-modifying proteins. OGT catalyses the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to serines and threonines of protein sites. As many known O-GlcNAcylation sites are also phosphorylation sites, OGT is proposed to play a major role in modulating cellular kinase signaling cascades. OGT is also involved in widespread transcriptional regulation. Prolonged hyperglycaemia, such as occurs in diabetes, or excessive glucose uptake, such as occurs in cancer cells, results in hyper-O-GlcNAcylation of cellular proteins by OGT, and this increased O-GlcNAcylation has been linked to harmful cellular effects. Aberrant glycosylation by OGT has been linked to insulin resistance, diabetic complications, cancers and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer\u2019s. Thus, strategies to modulate OGT activity may have therapeutic value for treating diabetic complications, cancer, and other diseases.",

    "ip_description": "A series of AAV-based gene therapy approaches to reprogram certain metabolic enzymes in rod and cone cells in the eye to promote survival in degenerative conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa. Additionally, an independent series of such vectors expressing HDAC genes and/or HIF1alpha variants to achieve the same. Given the heterogeneity of retinal degenerative disease identifying a common pathway for how degenerating cells die has led to insights into how cell death can be prevented. The Cepko lab has been able to show with single injections in a mouse model for RP (rd1), that introducing certain genes that ultimately modulate glycolysis/gluconeogenesis in cone photoreceptor cells can prevent cell death and maintain visual function weeks after control vector-injected animals have become blind. This concept has been validated by 2 separate gene-therapy based interventions in the same mouse model for retinitis pigmentosa. By preventing retinal cell death, rather than addressing the molecular lesion(s) that contributed to disease, retinal degeneration can be stopped and visual function can be maintained in a generic fashion, independently of the type of disease gene. The Cepko lab is currently working to optimize vector/gene combinations and is seeking collaborators that can help drive the program into clinic development. Reduced viability of rod and cone photoreceptor cells is associated with various retinal disorders, e.g. retinitis pigmentosa. Although most mutations that cause retinitis pigmentosa are in rod photoreceptor-specific genes, cone photoreceptors also die as a result of such mutations. Retinitis pigmentosa is a family of inherited retinal degenerations (RD) that is currently untreatable and frequently leads to blindness. Affecting roughly 1 in 3,000 individuals, it is the most prevalent form of RD caused by a single disease allele. The phenotype is characterized by an initial loss of night vision due to the malfunction and death of rod photoreceptors, followed by a progressive loss of cones. In January 2009, the Cepko lab published findings linking HDAC4 activity with survival in normal and diseased retinas. Hif1? activity was shown to be necessary for HDAC4 mediated survival activity and a stabilized allele of HIF1alpha was shown to be sufficient for rod survival. HIF1alpha can transcriptionally regulate glycolytic pathways. Similarly, changes in the insulin/mTOR pathway coincide with the activation of autophagy in cones and manipulation of the pathway via systemic administration of insulin can modulate the rate of cone death. Thus, two seemingly separate observations both implicating aspects of nutrient sensing or glucose homeostasis in cones, led to a testable hypothesis. If cones were dying because they were starving, interventions that perturb glucose homeostasis may rescue or delay cell death. The Cepko lab has created a gene therapy that could prevent the decline of vision in degenerative disease independent of etiology. Given the recent success in treating Leber\u2019s Congenital Amaurosis in humans with an AAV-based vector this Cepko lab invention could expand treatment options for degenerative diseases in the eye.",

Without apertures, different lenses for different apertures will not be needed to view differently sized samples.

Cre-mediated, simultaneous liver-specific knockout of Mad2 and p53 induces mouse cancer which share many common features of human liver cancer. These mouse cancers arise spontaneously within a background of regenerative nodules and cirrhosis without hepatotoxic and/or carcinogenic agents. The cancer develops in stages from liver cell proliferation, fibrosis, regeneration, adenoma to malignant carcinoma, mimicking the development of human liver cancers. The cancers in this mouse model arise spontaneously without the need of hepatoxin and or carcinogens in contrast with most current mouse models of HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma), which depend on the administration of hepatotoxic and/or carcinogenic agents to recreate the injury-fibrosis-malignancy cycles. Mad2 and p53 compound liver specific knockout mice exhibit distinct phenotypes that closely mimic the common features of human hepatocellular carcinoma, which include hepatocyte regeneration, genomic instability and the fibrotic tumor microenvironment. Mitotic spindle checkpoint is a multi-protein network that ensures the equal segregation of chromosomes into two daughter cells during mitosis. One important component of the spindle checkpoint is MAD2 (Mitotic arrest deficient 2), whose abnormal expression has been found in human cancers. MAD2 is located on human chromosome 4q arm, which is often found to be lost in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Further more, the loss of chromosome 4q arm has been found to be associated with p53 mutations in human hepatocellular carcinomas. The line of conditional compound knockout mice of Mad2 and p53 is generated using the liver-specific albumin gene promoter to drive the expression of Cre-recombinase in liver. The single conditional Mad2 knockout mice were bred with transgenic mice which expresses albumin promoter mediated Cre to obtain liver specific Mad2 knockout mice. The liver specific Mad2 knockout mice were then bred with the single conditional p53 knockout mice to obtain liver specific double knockout mice. Detail histological analysis by hematoxylin and eosin staining has shown extensive regeneration nodules and bile duct hyperplasia as well as inflammation in both Mad2 single knockout mice and Mad2 p53 double knockout mice. The proliferation of hepatocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemical assay with antibody to Ki67, which is a cellular marker for proliferation. The expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in liver was analyzed by real time RT-PCR. The liver pathology developed in stages. The disease progressed from enlarged hepatocytes, necrosis and inflammation to nodular regeneration and bile duct proliferation. Up-regulation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines was found in the liver of Mad2-deleted mice. Remarkably, loss of Mad2 in those mice results in hepatocellular adenoma (benign liver tumor) and hepatocellular carcinoma in 60% of animals, which is much higher than only 25% of normal mice with adenoma. The onset of tumor in those transgenic mice is also much earlier than in normal mice (age of 8 months compared with age of 23 months). Furthermore, Mad2 deletion synergize with p53 deletion to cause malignant liver cancers in mice. Array CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridization) shows that the liver cancers are highly aneuploid.",

    "ip_number": "3580",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "IDPCR is based on the melting temperature difference between duplex DNA formed intramolecularly versus intermolecularly. Binding of a target to its ligand would increase the effective molarity of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides linked to the target and ligand, promoting duplex formation between complementary regions on each strand that are otherwise too short to hybridize. The resulting hairpin thus serves as a starting point for primer extension. Crucially, only the newly extended hairpin contains in a single DNA strand two primer (or primer-binding) sequences that enable subsequent PCR amplification. IDPCR therefore results in the selective amplification of those DNA sequences previously attached to, and therefore encoding, ligand-target pairs.\n\nIn a model multiplex selection of a 261-member DNA-encoded ligand library with a 259-member DNA-encoded target library, designed to contain only five true ligand-target pairs out of 67,599 possible interactions, all five known ligand-target pairs were significantly enriched relative to control, with only 3 false positive signals (see figure).\n\nOverview of IDPCR: (a) A model library of DNA-encoded ligands mixed with a model library of DNA-encoded targets allows multiplexed detection of binding pairs. (b) IDPCR was used to perform a model selection on an equimolar 261-member DNA-ligand library and an equimolar 259-member DNA-target library containing five known protein-ligand pairs out of 67,599 possible combinations. For each protein target, the most highly enriched sequences (blue bars) relative to a control lacking proteins corresponded to the known protein-ligand pairs, labeled A-E in the plot. A: biotin + streptavidin (SA); B: desthiobiotin + SA; C: Gly-Leu-4-carboxy benzene sulfonamide + carbonic anhydrase II (CA), D: carboxy benzene sulfonamide + CA; E: trypsin +antipain.\n\nIDPCR represents a general method for selectively amplifying DNA sequences encoding ligand-target pairs. IDPCR can be applied to a wide variety of targets and potential ligands and can identify ligand-target pairs from libraries of small molecules and libraries of targets in a single solution. IDPCR is highly sensitive, takes place entirely in the solution phase, and can be performed in a few hours using routine equipment. A variation of this method, reactivity-dependent PCR, has been used for the multiplexed identification of molecules that undergo bond formation or cleavage. IDPCR will significantly enhance efforts to discover new ligands and targets, to reveal target-binding specificities of small molecules, and to detect low-abundance analytes.\n\nThe rapid identification of ligands to an ever-expanding number of biological targets of interest is a major technological challenge in the life sciences. Two fundamental limitations to existing target-oriented high-throughput screening methods are (i) the requirement that each target must successively be assayed against libraries of potential ligands (limits assay throughput), and (ii) the general reliance on immobilized targets or ligands adds immobilization, washing, and/or elution steps and is a source of artifacts. A solution-phase method to simultaneously reveal all ligand-target binding pairs from a single solution containing libraries of ligands and libraries of targets could overcome both limitations and significantly increase the efficiency and effectiveness of target oriented screening efforts. Researchers in the laboratory of Professor David Liu have developed such a method, interaction-dependent PCR (IDPCR).",

    "ip_description": "The Madix and Friend laboratories have developed a novel amide synthesis that uses metallic silver or silver-based alloy with oxygen adsorbed on the surface to catalyze the reaction of primary or secondary amines with alcohols or aldehydes. The catalyst may be supported on another solid and may be promoted with additives if desired; it can also be used in the pure, unsupported state. One of the main advantages of this synthesis is that the starting materials are not only inexpensive and widely-available, but they are also safe to handle and produce environmentally friendly byproducts (under optimal conditions, only water). Furthermore, this reaction provides for heterogeneous catalysis, and takes place under mild reaction conditions (at or near room temperature and atmospheric pressure). The synthesis is highly selective and yields the desired product in one step, and the byproducts are easily separated out.\n\nThe amide group is a key structural component of natural products, polymers, pharmaceuticals, and other synthesized compounds. Amidation reactions are therefore a crucial synthetic tool. However, current processes for introducing the amide group, such as reactions of carboxylic acid derivatives, modified Staudinger reactions, halide aminocarbonylation, ketoxime and aldoxime rearrangements, and transition-metal-catalyzed aminocarbonylation of alkenes and alkynes, are often procedurally complex, frequently involve costly or hazardous reagents, and may produce toxic chemical waste.

    "ip_description": "Copper (Cu) is now the preferred material for interconnections in ICs because it conducts better and lasts longer than aluminum. However, there are well-known problems with copper interconnects. Copper tends to migrate out of the wiring, degrading the operation of the IC. It can be corroded by exposure to oxygen and water. The phenomenon of electromigration can thin the copper interconnects, increasing their resistance and eventually breaking them, which lessens the useful life of the IC. Currently-used, tantalum-based barriers occupy volume of the wiring that should be filled with more conductive Cu, resulting in higher power consumption and slower operation of the IC. All these effects need to be countered to improve the performance of copper interconnects.\n\nThe invention, coupled with the invention in Harvard Case 3181, surround the copper with a superior protective barrier and stabilizing layer that solves the above-mentioned problems with Cu interconnects.\n\nCase 3181 (see published PCT/US2009/37826, WO2009/117670) involves a new method of first depositing a conformal thin film of Mn (or Co, Cr or V) into the insulator walls of vias and trenches to form a self-aligned barrier of MnSixOy. Then standard technology is used to fill them with Cu. Finally, a similar metal film is deposited on top of a Cu-filled trench after a CMP step as a capping layer to adhere the Cu strongly to the next layer of Si3N4. Use of these barriers and adhesion layers should increase the speed and lifetime of ICs, while decreasing their power consumption.\n\nCase 3631 ( US provisional filed October 2009) improves on the capping layer of case 3181 by adding a step before metal deposition that allows the metal deposition on Cu while preventing a metal layer from forming on the insulator. This process preserves the necessary properties of the insulator \u2013 a very desirable result. The new step involves reacting the surface after a CMP step with silane vapors. The silanes protect the insulator, but not the Cu, from deposition of the barrier and adhesion metal.\n\nThis invention, together with the invention from Harvard Case 3181, provides a more effective barrier around Cu interconnects which results in a longer living and faster functioning Integrated Circuits (ICs or chips) with lower power usage. Using commercially available precursor chemicals and deposition equipment, these methods can be readily adopted in standard CMOS manufacturing fabs.",

    "ip_description": "The novel approach taken by the Harvard researchers was to apply top-down nanofabrication techniques to define large arrays of vertically oriented nanowire antennas in a single-crystal diamond substrate. Briefly, structures were made from a commercially available Type Ib diamond crystal. Electron-beam lithography and reactive-ion etching were then used to realize 200-nm-diameter, 2-micron-long diamond nanowires with straight, smooth sidewalls. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are embedded randomly in fabricated devices because the diamond substrate has a background of natural NV centers that are created during the crystal growth process. A major advantage of the nanowire array platform is that the etching process itself results in mechanically isolated individual NV centers and minimized background fluorescence.\n\nThe readily fabricated diamond nanowire arrays retain the crucial properties of an NV center, are compatible with the requirements needed for the realization of scalable quantum systems based on diamond, interface the nano-world of a color center with the macro-world of optical fibers and lenses, and provide a foundation for enabling the integration of NV center-embedded diamond nanostructures into more complex photonic quantum information, sensing, and imaging devices with even higher count levels and lower powers.\n\n### Applications\n\nThe development of a robust light source that emits one photon at a time will allow new technologies such as secure communication through quantum cryptography. Devices based on fluorescent dye molecules, quantum dots and carbon nanotubes have been demonstrated, but none has combined a high single-photon flux with stable, room-temperature operation. Luminescent centers in diamond have recently emerged as a stable alternative, and, in the case of nitrogen-vacancy centers, offer spin quantum bits with optical readout. However, these luminescent centers in bulk diamond crystals have the disadvantage of low photon out-coupling.\n\nThe laboratory of Marko Loncar has demonstrated a single-photon source composed of a nitrogen vacancy center in a diamond nanowire, which produces ten times greater flux than bulk diamond devices, while using ten times less power. This result enables a new class of devices for photonic and quantum information processing based on nanostructured diamond, and could have a broader impact in nanoelectromechanical systems, sensing and scanning probe microscopy.",

There are strong structural and functional similarities among HIV, influenza, Ebola, Lassa fever, respiratory syncytial virus and possibly dengue and hepatitis C virus glycoproteins.\n\nIdentification of host proteins of interest: The long standing interest of this laboratory is to identify host proteins that activate virus glycoproteins. Recently, we have focused on the Ebola virus (EboV), which causes outbreaks of rapidly fatal hemorrhagic fever for which there is no therapy. We determined that cleavage of the GP1 subunit of the EboV glycoprotein by host endosomal cysteine proteases is the first step in a two-step mechanism and is functionally analogous to the role of CD4 binding to gp120 in HIV infection.\n\nSmall molecule inhibitors of Ebola: In newly completed work, we screened a small molecule library provided by NSRB and identified six novel compounds that inhibit the second, post-protease, step in EboV infection. Four of these compounds specifically inhibit EboV and not Lassa fever or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) infection. Remarkably, we find that 3.3, a derivative of the EboV inhibitor 3.0, is a more potent inhibitor of the Lassa fever virus and that an additional compound (7.0) blocks EboV and Lassa fever virus infection equally well. These findings suggest that closely related host factors trigger infection by Ebola and Lassa fever viruses, and also that the inhibitors we have identified may be lead compounds for development of new anti-viral drugs.\n\nApplications: The small molecule inhibitors identified in the lab may be lead compounds for the development of new anti-viral drugs for Ebola and Lassa fever virus.",

Undesired and uncontrolled algal blooms are a recurring problem in bodies of water such as swimming pools, aquaculture ponds, aquariums, industrial drainage systems and even the ocean. Various strategies have been used to control algal growth \u2013 previous attempts to solve the problem included the use of active chlorine, copper-containing compounds or quaternary ammonium salts. Most of these approaches have severe drawbacks, and chemicals that are commonly used can be toxic, corrosive, decompose readily and precipitate in hard water. Hence, the need for safer algicides remains.\n\nAlgal-bacterial symbiosis: Eukaryotes, including algae, evolved on the planet teeming with bacteria and close associations between eukaryotes and bacteria are common. Microscopic algae, in particular, co-exist symbiotically with bacteria of the roseobacter clade. Bacterial metabolites can serve as antibiotics and auxins, which suppress the growth of potentially parasitic bacteria and promote algal growth, respectively. The algae, in turn, contribute a suitable surface for roseobacter to colonize. In some cases, as the algae die, the bacteria switch from being a mutualist to a pathogen.\n\nPhaeobacticides \u2013 a new class of potent phytotoxins: Researchers in the Clardy and Kolter laboratories have discovered that a small molecule generated by compromised algae induces the roseobacter species to produce potent but selective phytotoxins. The researchers hypothesized that the initiator of the mutualist-to-pathogen switch would be produced by compromised algae \u2013 as algae senesce, their cell walls deteriorate and breakdown products are released into the surrounding medium. They therefore used a breakdown product of a component of the cell wall as a tool to study the response of three roseobacter strains to a compromised algal host. Culturing one specific strain with this breakdown product stimulated the production of a family of compounds that were not produced in the absence of the breakdown product. Two of these compounds, phaeobacticides A and B, were purified and further characterized:\n\n\u2022 Phaeobacticides form a new class of compounds: Researchers used a combination of analytical techniques \u2013 mass-spectrometry, x-ray crystallography and magnetic resonance to elucidate the small molecule structures of these compounds. Compounds A and B are structurally similar, and have no close relatives among known natural products or synthetic molecules. Very recent work has expanded the family of known molecules to over a dozen.\n\n\u2022 Phaeobacticides are potent phytotoxins: Algicidic activity of the two small molecules was measured against a panel of algae species. In several cases, the compounds were highly active \u2013 for example, the IC50 of phaeobacticides A and B against two common algae species was in the 0.1-0.2 \u00b5M range. In many cases algal cell lysis was observed after 24 hrs with cellular damage visible after 12 hrs.\n\n\u2022 The small molecules are selective: No antibacterial activity was observed at concentrations up to 0.16 mM and some algae species were less susceptible to the compounds. Taken together, the facts suggest that phaeobacticides are not generally toxic and can selectively impair particular species, an important advantage over some of the currently used chemicals.\n\n### Applications\n\nThe invention addresses the need for a low-toxicity anti-algae agent that can be used in a variety of settings:\n\n\u2022 Preventing algal growth in bodies of water: Algal blooms, if left unchecked can multiply to the point of rendering the water unfit for human use. The \u201cpond moss\u201d, greenish mats on the water surface can serve as the source of toxins, as well as physically block fish gills, fishing nets and water supply systems. As outlined above, most of the currently used algicides are non-specific chemicals, while phaeobacticides are the unique example of a natural product optimized to specifically target algae cells. The approach used by researchers in Clardy and Kolter laboratories can be extended to other bacterial strains and algae species resulting in a panel of phaeobacticides with different specificities. Also, phaeobacticides can be used in a combination with fungicides and bactericides. Such combinations might be less toxic and more efficient towards resistant pathogens.\n\n\u2022 Algae-resistant materials: Being stable small molecules, phaeobacticides can be easily incorporated into a variety of materials or industrial products which are in prolonged contact with water. Few examples include fishing nets, swimming pool plastic coating, exterior paints, and synthetic resin renderings for heat protection.",

    "ip_description": "Graphene is a single, atomic-layer thick two-dimensional sheet of bonded carbon atoms that is characterized by superb electric and mechanical properties, thermal conductivity, and optical transparency. Graphene is a promising candidate material for post-silicon microfabrication due to its high carrier mobility. However, current graphene device manufacturing processes do not address the need to integrate the graphene layer with electrodes for fabricating a range of device components based on graphene materials, such as FETs and electrical interconnects. This invention allows for the single-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene synthesis process to build monolithically-integrated electronic devices with structures and regions of varying numbers of graphene layers to produce a range of elements, including graphene channels and graphite electrodes. The single-step synthesis technique also enables the production of an entire device area, including interconnect lines, in a single step and the assembly of multiple components of FETs on flexible and transparent plastic films (Figure 1). In contrast to the multiple processing steps required in conventional complementary metaloxide- semiconductor (CMOS) microfabrication, this single-step process allows for the synthesis and integration of complex graphene devices, such as the fabrication of flexible semitransparent graphene FET arrays, graphene biosensors, and pH sensor arrays. For example, this invention allows for the straightforward fabrication of single or arrays of the protein biosensors illustrated in Figure 2. Carbon graphene structures may revolutionize the field of post-silicon electronics. However, a number of technical limitations prevent the advancement and widespread adoption of graphene nanolayer devices and components. The technology described here solves a number of those challenges by allowing for a single-step synthesis of a large number of monolithic graphene structures as well as the integration of graphene components with other circuit components made from carbon. This technology allows for the creation of a whole new class of graphene-based components and circuits. For example, the multilayer graphene structures synthesized with this technology can be transferred onto both rigid and flexible substrates, such as transparent plastic films, enabling a wide range of applications (see Figure 1). The single-step synthesis process allows for the creation of a range of devices, including sensors. For example, this technology can be used to create a monolithic graphene/graphite field-effect transistor (FET) device array that allows for real-time, multiplexed sensing, such as voltage, pH and, with the proper functionalization, sensing of biomolecules. An example FET biosensor is a macromolecule protein sensor with antibody receptors linked to the sensor\u2019s graphene layer as shown in Figure 2. This micro-scale sensor allows for the detection of minute amounts of specific proteins in solution for a large range of medical, drug development, and safety inspection applications.",

    "ip_description": "Despite decades of adjuvant research, only a handful of adjuvants have been approved in seven major global markets and only two (Alum and GSK\u2019s AS04) are licensed in the US. The availability of additional adjuvants has been minimized due to stringent requirements imposed by the FDA and EMEA. Several adjuvants like Although Alum is safe and efficacious in many prophylactic indications (particularly in those vaccines achieving protection through a strong Th2 response), it has proven unsuccessful in vaccines for pathogens (e.g. TB, HSV, HIV and malaria) that require a more complex immune response for vaccine effect like a CMI/ Th-1 type response.\n\nUnmet needs in the vaccine adjuvants include the following:\n\n1. Safety and non-toxicity with minimal systemic and local side effects\n2. Broad immunogenicity across all branches of the human immune response pathway, especially cell-mediated immunity (Th1)\n3. Ability to be used with mucosally-delivered vaccines, DNA vaccines, cancer and autoimmunity vaccines, live and inactive viruses, proteins, haptens\n\nTherefore, the development of novel adjuvants is an area of high interest for many companies.\n\nNovel adjuvant\nBisphosphonates are clinically approved and used extensively for the treatment of bone resorption diseases, such as osteoporosis. The von Andrian laboratory discovered a novel function for bisphosphonates by showing that they also enhance the adaptive immune response to a wide variety of antigens. Furthermore, bisphosphonates engage molecular pathways that are distinct from Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, such as AS04. Bisphosphonates may therefore be effective as novel adjuvants in vaccination, and have a straightforward path to the clinic.\n\nNovel mechanism of immune enhancement: To determine the mechanism of action of bisphosphonates on immune enhancement, the von Andrian laboratory investigated the effects of four specific bisphosphonates on immune cells. Their findings, summarized below, distinguish bisphosphonate adjuvant activity from that of other marketed and known adjuvants:\n\n\u2022 Bisphosphonates at clinically relevant doses when injected subcutaneously increase antibody responses to live and inactive viruses, proteins, haptens and existing commercial vaccine formulations (e.g., Hepatitits B vaccine Egenerix). This effect was observed following administration of bisphosphonates prior (up to 60 days), concomitantly, or after (up to 4 days)\n\n\u2022 Bisphosphonates increase the migration of dendritic cells from the site of injection to the local lymph nodes, increasing antigen presentation to B- and T- cells. Theytarget directly B cells and enhance B cell expansion and antibody production upon antigen encounter. These data establish bisphosphonates as a novel class of adjuvants that boost humoral immune responses.\n\n\u2022 Bisphosphonates exert their adjuvant-like activity in the absence of CD4+ and gd T cells, neutrophils or dendritic cells and their effect does not require local macrophage depletion nor does it depend upon Toll-like receptor signaling or the inflammasome.\n\nDespite decades of adjuvant research, only four adjuvants have been approved in the seven major markets. Of these, only two (Alum and AS04) are licensed in the US. The availability of additional adjuvants has been minimized due to increased safety requirements imposed by the regulatory authorities. Although Alum is safe and efficacious in many prophylactic indications (particularly in those vaccines achieving protection through a strong Th2 response), it has proven unsuccessful in many indications. The development of novel adjuvants is therefore an area of high interest for many companies.\n\nSmall molecule adjuvants are pharmaceuticals included in vaccine preparations to enhance the immune response and protection generated by vaccination. The inventors present evidence that two bisphosphonates can stimulate the adaptive immune response against multiple types of antigens. This suggests that bisphosphonates may be useful as adjuvants in the development of novel vaccine preparations, and particularly beneficial for:\n\n\u2022 Use with poorly immunogenic antigens. Increasingly, new infectious disease vaccines have moved away from whole cell/virus preparations toward individual non-infectious subunits. These preparations are safer, but less immunogenic. The inclusion of adjuvants may increase the potency of the immune response generated by vaccines containing these less immunogenic antigens.\n\n\u2022 Use in patients with compromised immune systems. In elderly or other immune-compromised patients, immune responses to traditional vaccines can be muted. The addition of an adjuvant can increase the potency of immune responses in these patients.\n\n\u2022 Use in vaccine preparation when antigen is difficult to produce. Some adjuvants can decrease the amount of antigen required to develop protection by vaccination. This may decrease the cost of vaccine production when an antigen is particularly expensive.",

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "This technology is for using a high field MR system to record interference patterns within biological phantoms combined with new spatial encoding methods to give contrast at resolution limits far exceeding traditional gradient-based encoding schemes. This interference-based approach can be used to initiate a new field of high field MR imaging. The principal advantage of MR at high field is the concomitant increase in signal-to noise ratio (SNR). However, at high field strength, the excitation wavelength becomes commensurate with the field of view (FOV). For example, at 7 T, the free space wavelength corresponds to about 1 m. The dielectric constant in a biological sample can be as high as 80 due to the high water content, and at a spin precession frequency of 300 MHz, this corresponds to a wavelength inside tissue of less than 15 cm. The operating wavelength is thus comparable to the diameter of most in vivo FOVs. To this end, both temporal and spatial variations of the excitation field must be taken into account, as well as the expected increase in field conductivity. For these reasons, we find that the propagation of radiation at ultra high fields (> 4 T) generates new phenomena commonly observed in quantum optics but traditionally negligible in NMR experiments, including phase modulation of the excitation field as well as wave interference. Advantages include: \u2022 Large field of view (FOV) imaging \u2022 Higher spatial and temporal resolution \u2022 Open architecture MRI scanners with pulsed B0 field. This NMR technology is a new approach to spatial encoding methods and contrast, at resolution limits far exceeding gradient-based encoding schemes, using high field systems to record inference patterns within biological phantoms.

Although \u03b2-catenin accumulation plays a role in hepatocellular carcinoma, mutations in the aforementioned genes are rare. This fact implicates the Wnt signaling pathway in HCC pathogenesis. To date, it has been unknown which Wnt ligands and/or FZD receptors are responsible for the activation of the \u03b2-catenin pathway in HCC. Here, we outline the role of Fzd2 in up-regulation of \u03b2-catenin production and subsequent hepatocellular carcinoma, breast, lung, colon, and ovarian cancer development. Research within the laboratory of Gavin Macbeath in Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School points to the role of the Wnt pathway in \u03b2 -catenin accumulation, and Fzd2 specifically as a potential therapeutic target against liver cancer. Research show that Fzd2 knockdowns reduce tumor growth in nude mice, reduction in Fzd2 activity via knockdown or antibody treatment results in reduced metastasis, and anti-Fzd2 treatment causes internalization of cell surface Fzd2 receptors.

    "ip_description": "A group of Harvard scientists led by Profs. Madix and Friend has developed a catalyst based on gold for very selective production of dimethyl carbonate. The new process is environmentally friendly and its advantages are threefold. First, it starts with inexpensive chemicals such methanol, oxygen and carbon monoxide and operates at low temperatures. Second, the catalyst is highly selective. Model studies show that nearly 100 percent of the starting materials got converted to dimethyl carbonate. Third, the gold catalyst can be easily recycled without using toxic organic solvents. Because only the gold surface acts as the catalyst, gold can be used in the form of thin films or nanoparticles to minimize material use while maintaining its catalytic capability. This innovation is not limited to the production of dimethyl carbonate and is applicable to other dialkyl carbonate production as well.\n\nDialkyl carbonates are widely used as solvents, reactive reagents, lubricants and fuel additives in industry. In particular, dimethyl carbonate is used as a green reagent for methylation and methoxycarbonylation. Large-scale industrial production of dimethyl carbonate was 170 tons/day in 1997 and worldwide demand far exceeds current production capacity. However, current processes to produce dimethyl carbonate either involve toxic reagents, undesirable chemical wastes or extreme reaction conditions. A green and selective process can help meet this huge demand.",

    "ip_description": "The fabrication of mechanical devices on the millimeter scale is a critical capability for autonomous microrobots and micromanipulation devices, and is important to manufacture active components in optical switches and smart antennas. However, available manufacturing technologies lack the versatility, precision, and cost-efficiency to produce large quantities of functional devices at this scale. The present invention is a revolutionary manufacturing process inspired by origami, which enables the manufacture of complex electromechanical systems, such as medical devices, small robots, or specialized sensors. Furthermore, the process allows for the use of a wide variety of materials, including alloyed metals, polymers, and carbon fiber sheets, to create complicated kinematic linkages, support structures, and assembly-assist features on a single layup. Full subcomponents such as motors, ICs, and batteries can also be integrated into devices during this fabrication process. The invented process employs low-cost, low-power operations such as laser micromachining, press lamination, and folding techniques to greatly reduce assembly expense and increase process scalability. For example, we present the \u201cMonolithic Bee\u201d robot. Fabrication starts with the laser micromachining of several material layers, ranging from structural carbon fiber sheet layers to flexible polyimide layers joint to create foldable joints. Laser micromachining creates patterns necessary for mechanical coupling, the release of rigid bodies comprising mechanical linkages, and the removal sacrificial material. Two piezoelectric transducer (PZT) plates used for device actuation are seen at the bottom of the image. After the initial micromachining, the material layers are aligned for press lamination using dowel pins and assembly-assist features cut into the layers. Micromachining and lamination operations can be performed several times on layups containing subsets of the device\u2019s layers. After the insertion of the discrete PZT subcomponents into the layups, the set can be laminated together to form a complete device, and functional components can be released with additional laser micromachining. After removal of the fully machined and laminated layup, the \u201cMonolithic Bee\u201d device is removed in its superplanar form. At this point, the 2D planar device is assembled by \u201cpop-up\u201d using a few assembly degrees of freedom built into the device\u2019s structure. The final 3D \u201cpop-up\u201d form of the Monolithic Bee\u201d device can then has its assembly degrees of freedom frozen in place using dip or wave soldering, completing the fabrication process.",

The new algorithm performs better than currently available compression formats for pedigree files by several magnitudes. Depending on the minor allele frequency, the SpeedGene algorithm selects among three different compression methods to minimize disk and memory storage space. The compression factor of the algorithm depends on the genotype frequency distribution of the markers and the number of subjects in the dataset and could range from 16 to several hundred, which potentially allows genomic data of thousands of people to be stored with only hundreds of megabytes of space. SpeedGene is currently implemented as a C++ library, and could be readily incorporated into common software programs for association studies, where the genetic information could be loaded using the library and directly sent for analysis.\n\nThe SpeedGene format does not require any CPU-time for decompression, and the storage structure of the genotypes allows fast computation of permutation methods. The library provides functions for loading the compressed files and retrieving any part of the original data. Furthermore, the implementation supports parallel processing of the dataset, i.e., loading of subsets of markers. This greatly decreases the loading time when parallel jobs are dispatched in clusters.\n\nIn conclusion, the SpeedGene library enables the storage and analysis of next generation sequencing data in existing hardware environment, making system upgrades unnecessary.\n\n### Applications\n\nThe pedigree file-format is one of the most commonly used input formats for genetic data analysis softwares, e.g. FBAT, PBAT, PLINK.

The system consists of a hollow nanotube, which serves as a probe, and a Si nanowire based field-effect transistor (FET), which serves as a signal convertor and collector. The small 50~100 nm nanotube probe introduces only negligible invasiveness to the cell during a measurement. The electrical potential signal produced by a living cell is captured and transmitted by the nanotube, and then the potential signal is converted into a current or a conductance signal by the nanoscale FET, which is in direct contact with the other end of the nanotube.

    "ip_description": "Offered here is a device that enables non-neurosurgical personnel to safely drill through the skull without the risk of additional brain damage. It consists of a handheld, portable, cranial drilling device that can be used with any diameter drill bit to create holes in the skull without traumatizing underlying brain tissue. The device relies on a dynamic bi-stable mechanism that supports drilling when force is being applied to the drill, but retracts inside a protective sheath when the force is reduced on penetrating the skull. The bi-stable mechanism is activated by centrifugal forces (due to drill rotation) that cause the linkages to change from the drilling position to the collapsed position at the moment of skull penetration. Initial testing on ex-vivo animal structures has verified that the retraction mechanism successfully removes the drill bit before damaging soft tissue beneath the skull. A reload mechanism allows the user to reset the device to the drilling position and create additional holes. The device is designed to access the brain in the emergency room, disaster relief, or in military settings. It is safe, portable, and versatile. Due to its safety features a general surgeon could operate the device, greatly increasing the availability of pressure monitoring for head trauma patients. Additionally, although this device was designed for cranial neurosurgery, the mechanism can also be used to increase safety in other drilling procedures. Our device can drill holes for inserting screws into the vertebrae, pelvis, or puncturing the sternum to access the pericardium while avoiding damage to delicate organs, nerves, or blood vessels. Penetrating the skull to measure intracranial pressure is an important intervention for diagnosing raised intracranial pressure following head trauma. Studies show that 1.7 million people suffer from head injury annually in the U.S., totaling $60 billion in costs. 275,000 of those injured annually are hospitalized and 52,000 will eventually die as a result of that injury. The risk of pressure-induced damage can be reduced by penetrating the skull with a small diameter hole and draining excess fluid or placing sensors inside the skull for pressure monitoring.

The existing protocol is based on a random access method and has limitations, such as traffic congestion and the difficulty of implementing quality-of-service (i.e. prioritization). A team of Harvard researchers, led by Professor H. T. Kung, developed a solution to these limitations; a new protocol based on a compressive sensing statistical method. This protocol takes a centralized approach to the problem, thus enabling efficient scheduling among a number of hosts and easing the implementation of quality-of-service. The invention can also coexist with current 802.11-based products. The new protocol, called compressive sensing medium access control (CS-MAC), takes advantage of the sparse property of a system, and has demonstrated its capability to acquire and extract critical information efficiently. For a system with a number of hosts, CS-MAC sets up a central coordinator to collect host requests compressively and make multiple grants simultaneously. Concurrent requests from several hosts can be combined in the air with only a few compressive measurements. On the other hand, currently established 802.11 standards take a random access approach. Because the lack of a central coordinator, requests from different hosts are competing with each other, resulting in traffic congestion. And it is also difficult to prioritize resources to different users and applications. CS-MAC overcomes these two major problems while maintaining low computational complexity. The protocol overhead for CS-MAC is shown to be comparable to basic 802.11 DCF when amortized over multiple packets.

When incident light is reflected off the disordered arrangement of scattering centers in the microdroplets, only certain wavelengths are reflected back, giving the appearance of color. In this invention, the size and spacing of these scatterers can be independently controlled, allowing for fine tuning of the light reflected from these scatterers to produce pure, saturated colors of narrow wavelengths. The invention also allows for enhancement of colors (i.e. red) not typically seen in structural color devices. The color is high in efficiency and does not rely on filtering for color selectivity. The coloration can be achieved with a wide range of chemicals and could be incorporated into flexible, low-power reflective displays.

It is based on standard planar fabrication processes (i.e. optical or electron beam lithography and plasma etching), but is able to fabricate suspended nanobeam structures from a starting bulk material (i.e. a single-crystal or thick film). In essence, the bulk nanomachining methodology \u201ccarves out\u201d suspended nanobeam elements from a given material. The process is fundamentally different from conventional surface nanomachining of free-standing structures in that there is no thin film heterolayer structure, and an isotropic wet chemical etch is not used to sacrificially remove any sub-surface layer. Instead, the proposed process makes exclusive use of anisotropic plasma etching to etch the bulk material from two slanting opposite angles. The result is a bulk nanomachining process which yields suspended, triangular cross-section nanobeam photonic elements. The key breakthrough of this process is the ability to create suspended structures from a single crystal diamond bulk material, for optical resonators and mechanical resonators. It can also be used to carve out other bulk materials.\n\n### Applications\n\nA scalable nanomachining process to fabricate suspended, free-standing structures, from a bulk material of single-crystal diamond.

    "ip_description": "A recently-discovered class of T cells - T follicular regulatory (TFR) cells - controls the production of antibodies. TFR cells inhibit T follicular helper (TFH) cells, which mediate antibody production in lymph nodes. Several autoimmune diseases are caused by inappropriate antibodies, including lupus and myasthenia gravis, and accordingly TFH cells are up regulated in these diseases. However, until now there has been no way of controlling the production of antibodies to specific antigens through T cell regulatory pathways. The Sharpe Laboratory has found a target on TFR cells (the surface receptor PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1) that when suppressed, increases the number of TFR cells, which they show selectively reduces antibody levels in vivo (HU Case 3723). They have also shown that transplanting populations of TFR can cause similar effects. Most importantly, they have shown that TFR cells selectively suppress humoral immune responses, but do not inhibit other arms of the immune system.\n\nTFR cells circulate in the blood, home to lymph nodes, and inhibit antibody production there. The Sharpe Lab has found for the first time that TFR cells circulate in the blood of mice, move to the germinal centers in lymph nodes, and inhibit the antibody-producing B cell response there. They transferred blood TFR cells from mice challenged with an antigen into mice completely lacking their own TFR cells. In the recipient mice, the transferred TFR cells not only move from the blood to the lymph nodes, but potently inhibit the production of IgG specific to the antigen challenge in the donor.\n\n### Applications\n\nAntibodies can be specifically suppressed to treat autoimmune disease\nCurrent treatments for autoimmune disease (e.g., corticosteroid therapy) are generalized and have multiple undesirable side effects. This invention has the potential to revolutionize treatment of these autoimmune diseases by specifically inhibiting the part of the immune response causing the disease while avoiding effects on other arms of the immune system. Diseases arising from antibodies to self proteins (auto-antibodies) such as myasthenia gravis and recurrent forms of Graves\u2019 disease are particularly good candidates for this therapy, as well as other autoimmune diseases with humoral immune components such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, graft-vs.-host-disease, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, and juvenile dermatomyositis.\n\nAmplified TFR populations can be transplanted to target specific antibodies\nTFR cells can be amplified in culture and transplanted to patients to suppress antibody production. They can be used in personalized therapy by extracting them from patients, selecting those that mediate the specific autoimmune response, amplifying and resupplying them to the patient.\n\nAntibodies to specific therapeutic proteins can be suppressed or enhanced\nA major complication in gene therapy is antibodies against the gene product being replaced.

Levodopa remains the gold standard treatment for PD, despite limitations including side effects and peripheral metabolism. Current research has focused on improving dosing formulations of levodopa, as well as newer antibody-based therapeutics in clinical trials. Despite the advances in levodopa dosing, peripheral metabolism of the drug before it reaches the CNS remains a major challenge. Levodopa is commonly dosed in combination with another drug, carbidopa, which serves to inhibit levodopa degradation in the mammalian gut via decarboxylation to dopamine within the GI tract. However, even with combination therapy, up to half of the dosed levodopa is not available in the CNS, impacted mainly by the gut microbiome. Side effects of levodopa treatments, such as dyskinesia, nausea, and diarrhea, are related to changing plasma concentrations of the drug and increased dopamine in the GI tract.\n\nThe Balskus Lab has discovered the bacterial enzyme responsible for levodopa decarboxylation and a small molecule inhibitor of peripheral levodopa metabolism by gut bacteria.

AFMT does not inhibit the growth of levodopa-metabolizing microbes and is non-toxic to mammalian cells. Co-administering levodopa, carbidopa, and AFMT has led to increased circulating levodopa levels in a mouse model.\n\nAFMT leads to increased bioavailability of levodopa and, by minimizing off-target metabolism, has the potential to generate more consistent and reproducible levodopa dosing between patients.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Loss of hair pigmentation has long been associated with stress; however, stress-related changes at the level of the somatic cell have only recently been elucidated. The hair follicle consists of two stem cell populations: epithelial-derived hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and neural crest-derived melanocyte stem cells (MeSCs), which when activated, produce a new hair follicle with pigmentation. Defects in melanin synthesis via loss of differentiated melanocytes or problems in MeSC maintenance can lead to loss of pigmentation in the hair. It has been posited that immune attack from stressors that cause elevated corticosterone and norepinephrine in the blood could be responsible for stress-related hair pigmentation loss. The laboratory of Prof. Ya-Chieh Hsu has uncovered that transient suppression of MeSC proliferation prevents stress-induced hair greying. Increased MeSC loss and hair greying was a response to activation of the sympathetic nerves. When artificial activation of sympathetic nerves with resiniferatoxin (RTX) was administered with buprenorphine, an opioid analgesia, it prevented activation of the sympathetic neurons. Transgenic mice were generated by Dr. Hsu\u2019s lab that were able to artificially activate sympathetic nerves using clozapine N-oxide (CNO). In sites where CNO was injected, it resulted in hair greying. Transient suppression of MeSC proliferation was achieved in Dr. Hsu\u2019s lab through the topical application of cell cycle inhibitors (AT7519 and flavopiridol). Understanding the mechanisms of pigmentation loss in hair can give insights into how MeSC loss contributes to aging and whether stress can mimic an accelerated aging process. Use of pain relievers and topical cell cycle inhibitors could be used to reduce hair greying. Therefore, slowing MeSC proliferation is a potential target to treat greying hair and could enable the use of transcriptomic analysis to develop novel treatments for anti-aging.",

The Clardy lab at Harvard Medical School has identified a molecular mediator that recapitulates the desirable immunomodulatory effects associated with this important member of the human gut microbiota. The research team isolated a naturally occurring diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine lipid from the cell membrane of Akkermansia muciniphila that selectively modulates human immune responses. Pre-treatment by the natural lipid and equipotent synthetic analogs was found to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine release by TLR2-TLR1 and TLR4 agonists. These lipids are hypothesized to induce low-level stimulation of the TLR2\u2013TLR1 signaling pathway to modulate the immunological tone of the host immune system by resetting the activation threshold to moderate strong pro-inflammatory signals and ignoring weak signals to restore homeostatic immunity.

By studying the mechanisms that rule mature melanocyte formation in response to stress and aging, the Hsu Lab is well-positioned to uncover a way to prevent or treat hyperpigmentation. When melanocyte stem cells are activated to generate mature melanocytes, some remain in the hair follicle to determine hair color, while others move into the skin to dictate skin pigmentation.

Hair growth undergoes a cycle of rest and growth, where hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) either remain quiescent or become transiently proliferative. The methods developed by Dr. Hsu to modulate hair growth by controlling hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) activation could lead to hair loss treatments and hair removal products. Findings from the Hsu lab suggest that without noradrenaline signaling, HFSCs enter deep quiescence, while sympathetic nerve activation of HFSCs directs the formation of a sympathetic nerve niche, which controls hair follicle regeneration in adults. Exposure to cold and topical application of a beta-2-adrenergic receptor agonist (procaterol) increases sympathetic nerve activity in the niche and promotes hair regrowth. Interestingly, the Hsu Lab found that fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18) is a key player in promoting the quiescence of HFSCs, pointing to the modulation of FGF18 as an alternative method to induce or repress hair growth.

Hair follicle regeneration is largely governed by a special cell type called hair follicle stem cells, which respond to both hormonal and neuronal signals.

    "ip_description": "Around 16 billion injections are performed worldwide each year, mostly for therapeutic applications including the delivery of biologics such as insulin and monoclonal antibodies. Compared to intravenous injections, subcutaneous injections are preferred since they can be self-administered and do not require hospital visits. However, development of subcutaneously injectable drugs is hampered by the limitations of existing animal models, primarily, their poor ability to correlate with human pharmacokinetics. The absence of a satisfactory pre-clinical model greatly increases the risk of clinical development, especially higher costs and lower success rates. To solve this problem, a research team from Professor Samir Mitragotri\u2019s lab has created a device called Subcutaneous Co-Culture Tissue-on-a-chip for Injection Simulation (SubCuTIS). This technology features a three-dimensional co-culture tissue architecture that mimics the physiological characteristics of subcutaneous tissues in vivo. This organ-on-a-chip device is like a small, artificial piece of tissue that can measure the movement of biologics when injected subcutaneously. The SubCuTIS device helps researchers understand how fast and effectively biologics will move through the tissue after injection. This approach identifies subtle differences in local absorption rate constants for clinically relevant biologics including monoclonal antibodies. SubCuTis can help predict some of the most relevant aspects of subcutaneously injected drugs including bioavailability in humans, site-to-site variability after injection, local disposition of the drug after injection and parameters that improve the injection performance. SubCuTIS represents a significant advancement in expanding the practical applications of organs-on-chips as a standardized and accessible device for quantitatively analyzing subcutaneous drug transport.

    "ip_description": "Optical resonators trap light and amplify it to build power. They then emit it in a more controlled powerful form. They are used as laser sources, signal amplifiers, and sensors. They make telecommunications more efficient by enabling information to be transmitted simultaneously on different frequencies of light. Resonators in commercial use can operate in a single symmetric mode. The team in Federico Capasso\u2019s lab have invented a resonator that can transmit light in multiple orthogonal modes, can change the beam mode when reflected, and can be asymmetric. They were able to change the free spectral range, resonance linewidth, and quality factor, and produce mode-independent resonances, which allow a single resonator to generate different spatial profiles. The cascade resonators are fabricated using silicon-on-insulator techniques, which are expected to facilitate customization, highly scalable production, and ready integration into existing optical systems.",

The original home was built in Cambridge, Massachusetts before 1940. The building is expected to be net zero, producing more energy in the rest of its lifetime than was consumed to manufacture, transport, and install materials in the 2018 renovation. HouseZero does not have a conventional heating, ventilation, or air conditioning (HVAC) system. Its thermal comfort depends on natural ventilation, solar insolation, thermally active building systems, and geothermal wells, which are driven by computational control of pumps, valves, motors, and a heat pump. Sensors inside and outside the building, such as CO2 concentration sensors, occupancy sensors, wind speed sensors, relative humidity sensors, and thermometers measuring interior and exterior temperature, are integrated with actuators controlling window motors and heat pumps. The lab inside HouseZero allows researchers to study and test learning algorithms in the building with a single zone, multiple zones, or the entire building. A hybrid physical and virtual testbed supports algorithm testing before deploying it in the physical building.

    "ip_description": "Stroke survivors often have difficulty with upper body movement, and rehabilitation at home can be challenging. Exoskeletons can be incredibly beneficial for ergonomic structural support in rehabilitation, but due to their size, cost, and complexity, they are only used in clinics. Rigid exoskeletons can also be challenging to customize and adapt to a user\u2019s limbs. A research team from the Harvard Biodesign Lab has developed a new soft upper-limb robot that uses the user's skeletal structure as its frame, allowing for more natural and safer motion. The system leverages soft actuation techniques\u2014like pneumatic or cable-driven mechanisms\u2014that increase portability and ease of use. This can extend the robot's use to outside clinical environments and therapy at home. This system does not require precise alignment, which makes setup quicker and operation easier than rigid systems. This flexibility can lead to increased patient engagement and the potential for more therapy time to be spent on motion rather than adapting the exoskeleton to the user, improving rehabilitation outcomes. It is also designed to adapt dynamically to user movements through sophisticated sensor integration and control systems. It uses inertial measurement units (IMUs) to estimate limb positions and adjust assistive forces in real-time, offering more personalized support.",

    "ip_description": "Flexible sensors are attached to a surface to measure the amount of deflection or bending. They are well suited to measuring movement in various applications, including human-machine interfaces and rehabilitation. However, strain detectors developed for rigid materials or where sensor removal and replacement are difficult do not work well if the underlying material is too soft or flexible. Additionally, the characteristics that make them flexible impose other limitations, generally in sensitivity, measurement repeatability, and durability. The inventors have developed a silicone-based sensor that leverages low mechanical loss materials to deliver excellent signal stability and bandwidth for strains under 5%. The novel fabrication method introduces a liquid elastomer adhesive layer, maintaining flexible functionality while offering rapid stress relaxation response (under 1 second) and low cyclic drift. This enhances the sensor's reliability and performance in real-world applications such as health care devices to monitor breathing, haptic devices to measure human movement, soft robotics, structural health monitoring of machinery, and as a component of smart textiles.",

    "ip_description": "Picking up and moving irregular or fragile objects can be difficult to automate. Robotic graspers require awareness of the object's shape and areas of fragility. The pressure must be strong enough to hold the object's weight but delicate enough not to cause damage. A research group out of Prof. Rob Wood's Microrobotics Lab has invented a soft robotic end effector using elongated, high aspect-ratio filaments actuated by fluid pressure, cables, etc., to grasp complex and fragile objects by entangling them. The filaments\u2019 curling motions passively conform to diverse shapes through collective entanglement and do not rely on direct feedback control. Compared to traditional robotic graspers that require precise planning and feedback, the entangling process is robust and adaptable, accommodating irregular and diverse geometries. Even for heavy objects, where a stronghold is required, individual filaments apply weak pressure, broadly distributing the forces applied to the item being grasped and keeping it from damage. The grasper is well-suited to applications in agriculture and aquaculture that require delicate handling of fragile, non-standard materials such as plants and marine life. The grasping filaments can be customized to match the requirements for specific applications. Beyond lifting and transporting objects, the grasping filaments can also monitor items, for example, by attaching sensors to them.",
