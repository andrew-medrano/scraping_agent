Second, for those molecules that enter into the zeolite pores, membrane transport and separation are dependent upon a combination of affinity (sorption) and mobility (diffusion). CO2 separation is one of the most studied applications for zeolite Y membranes because of its industrial significance, such as CO2 capture for carbon sequestration, natural gas purification, and separation of product streams from water gas shift reactions for hydrogen production.\n\nThe Ohio State researchers, led by Dr. Prabir Dutta, developed membranes of modified zeolite Y that were two micrometers thick and free of pinholes on smooth, multi-layer graded alumina ceramic supports.

    "ip_description": "A new wrought magnesium alloy with optimal mechanical and formability performance suitable for industrial applications. Magnesium (Mg), the lightest structural metal, and its alloys, with their high specific strength and low density, are promising lightweight materials for industrial applications in automotive, aerospace, and electronic sectors. A 2019 report by Business Communications Company (BCC) Research highlights vehicle light-weighting with Magnesium as a $4.1 billion USD global market and finds that this is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.9% to 5.7 billion USD by 2024 (EGY166A). Currently, however, there are limitations on the applications of Mg alloys when compared to commercial aluminum alloys and steels. These limitations are largely due to the low strength, poor ductility, and poor formability at room temperature associated with Mg alloys currently available in the market. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop wrought Mg alloys which can be formed at room temperature, especially for high-volume industrial applications such as the automotive market. To address this unmet need, the Lightweight Materials and Manufacturing Research Laboratory led by Professor Alan A. Luo at The Ohio State University has developed a new magnesium alloy, ZAXME11100 (Mg-1.0Zn-1.0Al-0.5Ca-0.4Mn-0.2Ce). This new alloy possesses a better combination of tensile yield strength (245 MPa), elongation (29%) and formability (Erichson index 7.8mm from 20mm diameter cup test) at room temperature, compared with other magnesium alloys and commercial aluminum alloys reported in literature. CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) modeling was used to optimize the addition of alloying elements by controlling solute concentration and precipitate in the Mg matrix. Additionally, CALPHAD and kinetic modeling was used to develop a new homogenization process for the new alloy which achieves complete dissolution of alloying elements without incipient melting. These computational thermodynamic and kinetic models were successfully combined to create a new Mg alloy design with excellent strength and ductility as well as the ability to be formed at room temperature. The researchers tested their new alloy via a series of carefully designed tensile and Erichsen cupping (20mm) tests. Commercial Applications: Sheet, extrusion and forged components for lightweight applications in Automotive: structural and closure panels; interior and chassis components, Aerospace: seats, luggage rails, and sheet components, Electronics: casing, housing, chassis, frames.

    "ip_number": "T2024-211",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "This Ohio State University software innovation offers groundbreaking analytical speed and automation of Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) as well as analysis of 3D data and images extending beyond the field of microscopy. Our technology offers real-time spatial analysis in continuous and discrete space, enabling unprecedented speed and efficiency in data processing that translates into faster decision-making, high-throughput screening capabilities, and broad applicability beyond traditional microscopy.\n\n**Background**\nSingle-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) describes a family of fast-evolving, powerful imaging techniques that dramatically improve spatial resolution over standard, diffraction-limited microscopy techniques and can image biological structures at the molecular scale. SMLM can now be performed even on benchtop microscopes. In SMLM, individual fluorescent molecules are computationally localized from diffraction-limited image sequences and the localizations are used to generate a super-resolution image or a time course of super-resolution images, or to define molecular trajectories. Single molecule localization microscopy generates data in the form of Cartesian coordinates of localized fluorophores. Cluster analysis is an attractive route for extracting biologically meaningful information from such data and has been widely applied. Although powerful, these approaches have historically been computationally intensive, precluding real-time analysis.\n\n**Innovation: Real-Time SMLM Analysis**\nOSU researchers have developed a computationally efficient software suite based on novel mathematical, statistical, and computational frameworks capable of real-time analysis of SMLM data, which can run on traditional desktop or laptop computers (not just expensive, purpose-built servers / super-computing networks). Spatial Pattern Analysis in Continuous space Enabled by Voronoi Tessellation-based Cluster Segmentation (SPACE-VorTeCS) is an algorithmic analysis pipeline that groups single molecule localization microscopy data (molecular coordinates) into clusters, discretizes the clusters into a binary image mask, and rapidly measures the spatial relationship between two species of localizations captured by the binary image masks using a form of discrete nearest neighbor point pattern analysis. This analytical software can process large datasets (tens to hundreds of millions of points) in a remarkably short time frame (seconds to minutes), exceeding the acquisition speed of current SMLM microscopes and their software by sufficient magnitude to enable high-throughput automation of SMLM experiments. (This difference in speeds as compared to existing solutions increases with the number of dimensions to be analyzed.)\n\n**Addressing a Critical Need**\nTraditional microscopy struggles to visualize structures smaller than 250 nanometers, hindering research in drug discovery, materials science, and other fields. SMLM overcomes this limitation (seeing structures at the 10-20 nm level) but suffers from slow and complex data analysis, impeding real-time insights and high-throughput screening.\nMethods like ThunderSTORM and DeepSTORM3D analyze the raw movies from the SMLM microscopes to extract the single molecule localizations but do not offer any capabilities for then analyzing those localizations to extract biological insights. Our approach is built to take over where these let off \u2013 we perform cluster analysis of the localizations resulting from the techniques. Thus, our competitors would be tools like ClusterVisu, SR-Tesseller, and STORM-RLA. Compared to these methods, we offer 1) 100-1000-fold faster analysis, 2) richer and more robust insights by using the most appropriate statistical methods, and 3) capability for automating experiments (not just image collection), which has no precedent.\n\n**Our Competitive Advantages**\n*   **Faster Analysis:** Our software processes data faster than acquisition rates, enabling crucial real-time insights.\n*   **High-Throughput Screening:** Analyze large datasets rapidly based on single-molecule properties.\n*   **Parameter-Free Analysis:** Provides clear and transparent \"white-box\" solutions without room for bias.\n*   **Broader Applicability:** Adaptable beyond microscopy for analyzing multi-dimensional data.\n\n**Target Applications**\n*   **Drug Discovery & Development:** Real-time analysis of drug-molecule interactions for faster identification of promising drug candidates.\n*   **Diagnostic Pathology:** Automated high-throughput screening for early diagnosis of disease based on subtle nanoscale remodeling.\n*   **Materials Science:** Investigate material properties at the nanoscale for advancements in batteries, solar cells, and electronics.\n*   **Biomedical Research:** Gain deeper understanding of cellular processes, protein interactions, and disease mechanisms.",

    "ip_description": "Peripheral neuropathy (PN) results in loss of innervation by the peripheral nerves in tissues such as skin, muscle, heart, and adipose tissue. It is a painful, debilitating disease, that is estimated to affect between 20 and 30 million Americans. The number of Americans affected by PN is likely much higher because many individuals with symptoms are not tested and there is a lack of accurate diagnostics, particularly for small fiber neuropathies. Small fiber are the top categories for PN, and encompass diabetes/obesity, aging, chemotherapy-induced, long COVID and more.\n\n**The Need**\nThere are currently no therapies that can halt the neuropathy and stimulate regeneration of the peripheral axons. Under certain conditions like nerve crush injury, peripheral nervous system axons are more capable of regeneration than the nerves of the central nervous system. Therefore, new therapies capable of coaxing these neuropathic axons to recovery are needed. PN is the number one cause of neurodegeneration in humans.\n\n**The Technology**\nResearchers at The Ohio State University have developed a novel gene therapy strategy for treating peripheral neuropathy using adipocyte-targeting adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver neurotrophic factors (BDNF and NGF) directly to adipose tissue to encourage neurite outgrowth to those specific cells. This proof-of-concept approach showed promising results in improving tissue-specific PN in obese/diabetic mice. This approach could utilize other AAVs to target peripheral nerve subtypes or additional cells/tissues, reducing off-target effects from systemic treatments\n\n**Benefits/Advantages**\n*   Localized delivery to peripheral nervous tissue minimizes off-target effects.\n*   Gene therapy approach offers a potentially long-term solution compared to traditional therapies.\n*   Ability to provide combination therapy with multiple neurotrophic factors targeting different tissues/cells in a physiologically-relevant manner.\n*   Addresses a critical gap in PN treatment, offering hope for millions suffering from metabolic conditions.",

    "ip_description": "An electrochemical process on a metal electrode catalyst is used to produce alcohols such as ethanol, ethylene, propanol, acetic acid, ethane, and formic acid from the direct conversion of carbon dioxide. In the United States, there is an increasing interest in ethanol as an alternative fuel source to decrease the dependence on fossil fuels. In 2012, the National Corn Growers Association reported that 27.3% of the corn harvested in the U.S. was used for the production of ethanol. This has sparked a debate on whether corn should be used as food or fuel. In addition, production of ethanol from corn is not very energy efficient and requires massive amounts of water for corn cultivation and processing. Therefore, more sustainable and energy efficient methods to manufacture ethanol are needed that use feedstocks that do not compete with food supply. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Anne Co, developed a method to produce alcohol from the direct conversion of carbon dioxide. Dr. Co utilized electrochemical processes on a metal catalyst resulting in over 50% selectivity for hydrocarbon formation. Carbon dioxide for this process can be scrubbed from the air or various highly concentrated sources, such as waste streams from chemical plants or coal power plants. Commercial Applications: Production of ethanol, propanol, ethylene, acetic acid, ethane, and formic acid. Benefits/Advantages: Mitigate dependence on corn to produce ethanol, More energy efficient that current processes to produce ethanol, Production is performed at ambient pressures and temperatures, Utilizes carbon dioxide, which comprises 82% of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, as chemical feedstock.",

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death across the US and worldwide and affects almost half of all adults in the US. CVD encompasses a number of conditions that affect the heart and vasculature. CVD can arise in response to multiple factors, including obesity. Obesity elevates the risk of CVD by increasing the development and severity of comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes.\n\nThe Need\nCellular therapies hold immense promise for treating various conditions, but current methods face significant challenges such as limited cell sources and cumbersome pre-processing steps. Existing reprogramming approaches often rely on viral transfection, which has limitations and safety concerns. There is a critical need for safer, more deterministic, and non-viral in vivo reprogramming methods to enhance the effectiveness of cell-based therapies.\n\nThe Technology\nResearchers at The Ohio State University have developed a novel tissue nanotransfection (TNT) approach that enables topically and controllably delivering reprogramming factors to tissues through a nanochannelled device. This method allows for direct cytosolic delivery of reprogramming factors by applying a highly intense and focused electric field through arrayed nanochannels, nanoporating tissue cell membranes and driving reprogramming factors into the cells. This novel TNT approach has been shown to negate the adverse effects of a high-fat diet on body weight, adiposity, cardiac function and cardiac remodeling in mice. The novel method is especially useful for treating obesity, and CVD related to obesity, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, stroke, atherosclerosis, heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. The novel method is also useful for inducing skin tissue to produce insulin for treating diabetes.\n\nCommercial Applications\n* Regenerative Medicine: Reprogramming tissues to promote tissue repair and regeneration.\n* Cell-based Therapies: Enhancing efficacy of cell-based treatments for various conditions.\n* Personalized medicine: Tailoring treatments based on individual patient needs and genetic profiles.\n\nBenefits/Advantages\n* Safer delivery: Non-viral approach reduces the risk of adverse side effects associated with viral transfection.\n* Deterministic reprogramming: Enables more focused and ample delivery of reprogramming factors at the single-cell level, enhancing efficacy.\n* Versatility: Can be applied to different tissue types and reprogramming scenarios, enhancing its potential for diverse applications.",

Magnetic gears have several advantages: low noise and vibration, reduced maintenance, and inherent overload protection. Magnetic gears are used in applications that require variable speed control and precise torque transmission, such as robotics, aircraft, and automation.\n\nThe Need\n\nAlthough magnetic gears provide several advantages to their traditional mechanical counterparts, they suffer from torque transmission inefficiency due to end-effect loss, which occurs when the magnetic flux leaks axially into the surrounding air and fails to couple between the rotors. As industries seek advanced gearing solutions, there's a rising demand for technologies that offer enhanced efficiency, reduced maintenance, and quieter operation.\n\nThe Technology\n\nThese Ohio State University technologies integrate cladding magnets and Halbach array configurations, offering enhanced efficiency, torque output, and performance. In the case of cycloidal magnetic gears, the addition of cladding magnets enables higher gear ratios without the need for a flux modulator, simplifying design while maintaining or improving performance. Halbach array cladding magnets optimize magnetic efficiency and torque output, making these gears ideal for applications in spacecraft, electric aircraft, and environments with limited maintenance requirements. Similarly, in coaxial magnetic gears, cladding magnets mitigate end-effect losses and improve overall efficiency, leading to quieter operation, reduced maintenance needs, and increased torque output potential. These advancements position magnetic gears as competitive alternatives in industries requiring noise reduction, lubrication-free operation, and overload protection.\n\nCommercial Applications\n\nThis invention can replace mechanical gears and gearboxes in many applications,including space, aerospace, wind turbines, vehicles, and many others.\n\nBenefits/Advantages\n\nThe incorporation of cladding magnets revolutionizes magnetic gear performance. It not only boosts torque output potential and reduces end-effect losses but also reduces noise, eliminates lubrication needs, and ensures inherent overload protection. Compared to mechanical gears, this design is quieter, eliminates a gearbox, and provides sufficient torque. In addition, it does not require lubrication and provides overload protection.",

    "ip_description": "The Ohio State University researchers led by Dr. Rajiv Shivpuri have developed a die design approach for friction stir extrusion that optimizes metal flow to improve production efficiencies. Friction stir extrusion (FSE) is a variation of friction stir processing that enables the hot extrusion of metal profiles from billet or other precursor material without preheating. This process saves significant thermal energy over conventional metal extrusion processes and can impart favorable microstructures to the end products. However, current FSE technologies have significant limitations regarding the high starting forces/torques required, which increase spindle requirements and restrict the materials that can be effectively processed. Researchers at The Ohio State University have developed a streamlined FSE die design approach that optimizes the metal flow, resulting in reduced force and torque requirements. A tapered plug with small interference can be used at the end of the mandrel to assist in initial heat generation. The angled die increases the die-to-metal contact area during the process to enhance heat generation and transfer. Furthermore, the angled die promotes more efficient metal flow during extrusion, which improves extrusion rates and reduces spindle loads/torques. Commercial Applications: Lightweight automotive frames for commercial and military applications, Advanced structures for aircraft and spacecraft, Metallurgical processing and manufacturing, Enhanced industrial applications, Metallic, multi-metallic, and MMC material system applications.

The Corpus contains spoken utterances by 535 speakers, including the following: 264 North Carolina speakers (Southern Appalachian), 134 Wisconsin speakers (Northern variety), and 137 Ohio speakers (standard Midwestern (Midland dialect). The Corpus includes 96 children (8-14 years) and 439 adults (18-101 years), all born, raised, and spent most of their lives in the regions they represented. Seventy hours of raw speech in the Corpus includes 22k single words, 96k structured sentences, and 500 spontaneous talks. The Corpus can be used in speech recognition technology, including speaker recognition and diarization, phonetic classification and syllabification, phonotactic modeling, pitch and prosody modeling, or speech recognition tasks that use specialized acoustic information for accent and dialect identification. This cross-dialectal and the cross-generational set would contribute to developing improved algorithms for better models that capture segmental and suprasegmental variation in speech. This could also improve medical devices for patients who use artificial voice due to laryngeal cancer and surgical removal of the larynx. The corpus provides a good training base for applying dialect-specific models due to its specific design and the common speech material collected from many speakers.

    "ip_description": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor accounting for 47.7% of all brain cancers. Unfortunately, treatments are limited, and survival is poor, with approximately only 40% living past the first-year post-diagnosis and 17% in the second year. Developing drugs for cancers like GBM is challenging as traditional two-dimensional cell culture models do not fully encompass all the features of human tissues. They do not adequately simulate living tissue and microenvironments. Cancer stem cells can readily adapt to changing microenvironments leading to drug resistance and recurrence. Hence, there is a significant need to develop new screening tools that consider the various microenvironment components and the different subpopulations within a given cancer type for better understanding the disease and developing efficacious drugs. This invention describes the development of peptide nanoparticles that mimic the extracellular matrix present within the brain \u2013 and other tissues \u2013 that have an affinity for cancer cells. As a result, tumor cells involved in tumor progression preferentially bind to the nanoparticles and can be isolated and studied within the laboratory. The inventors have developed prototypes of the nanoparticles, showed the cells could be isolated, and enabled the classification of subpopulations cancer cells selected by extracellular matrix affinity. This invention can be a life science tool for basic research and drug development for GBM and other cancers. Existing tools for research and evaluating drugs for brain cancers (and many other cancers) are limited as they do not simulate complex microenvironments in the brain. This invention overcomes these limitations, enabling scientists to design drugs that can specifically address the growth and migration of cancer stem cells based on how they interact with the extracellular matrix within the brain.",

Model input, execution and visualization of output, which includes time series of significant wave heights, are handled through an easy-\u00adto-\u00aduse graphical user interface (GUI). Researchers from The Ohio State University College of Engineering Department of Civil, Environmental and Geodetic Engineering and Engineering Education Innovation Center have developed DG\u00adWAVE, a numerical wave model that uses a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method to solve a set of parametric wave equations describing the spatial and temporal evolution of wave momentum due to winds. The model requires a finite element mesh of the water body of interest, e.g., a given lake or portion of an ocean basin, referred to as the model domain as an input. Also, a meteorological forcing file describing the wind velocity over the model domain for a specified period of time is needed. Both the mesh and the meteorological forcing file must be provided in formats consistent with the ADCIRC model (see adcirc.org). The model can be used to both 'hindcast' (using historical wind records) and forecast (using predicted wind fields) wave conditions due to wind. As final output, the model produces time series of significant wave heights, defined traditionally as the average value of the highest one\u00ad-third of the waves in a series and formally as four times the standard deviation of the water surface elevation. More informally, the measure of significant wave height is meant to quantitatively express the wave height estimated by a 'trained observer' and is commonly used as a measure of the height of ocean waves.

The Need: Optical polarization controllers and rotators are necessary components to control optical polarization in bulk bench-scale optics. Current approaches to achieve on-chip polarization control on a chip include asymmetric gratings, waveguides with asymmetric slanted sidewalls, dual core waveguides with asymmetric axes, waveguides with asymmetric trenches, triple waveguide couplers, and bi-layer slots. These current methods suffer from several drawbacks: 1. They are static because they rotate the polarization by only a fixed amount. Rotation angles vary among approaches and can be as low as 39 degrees, corresponding to TE-TM conversion efficiencies of 40%. Currently, an on-chip tunable polarization rotator in silicon does not exist. 2. They rely on asymmetric geometries with impedance mismatches resulting in degradation of insertion loss. 3.

GPS is limited in certain settings where the signal is degraded or blocked such as city centers with high\u2010rise buildings or inside buildings. Another issue with GPS signal is that it uses low power, meaning that it can easily be jammed causing problems in military operations. The prevalence of GPS enabled devices will not diminish nor will user demand for better coverage and reliability. A solution is needed that allows a device to navigate without relying entirely on a consistent GPS signal.\n\nThe Technology\nDr. Alper Yilmaz and his colleagues at The Ohio State University have developed a novel way for a GPS enabled system to navigate with a consistent signal.

The first on of these is the multi\u2010layered GIS data available through map sources such as Open Street Maps or Building Information Models (BIM). The nodes and the layers in the GIS data provide information for localization and navigation.

    "ip_description": "This artificial skin technology produces a similar reflectivity as human skin in the 76-77 GHz frequency range and can be effectively used on mannequins for pedestrian pre-collision system (PCS) evaluations. According to fatality crash data from the 2003-2012 Fatality Analysis Report System (FARS) in United States, there was an average of around 4,400 pedestrian fatalities per year, accounting for 11-14% of all traffic fatalities and the numbers have continued to rise in recent years. In Japan, the nearly 2,000 pedestrian fatalities that same year accounted for 36 percent of all traffic fatalities. Pedestrian PCS (pre-Collision Systems), have been introduced by several leading vehicle manufacturers such as Toyota, Mercedes, Ford etc. in order to reduce pedestrian fatalities. The percentage of driver related violations in 2012 reached to 22%. For these reasons, advanced forward looking PCS systems have a high potential to improve safety for this group of road users. The viability of the vision sensors depend on mannequins that correctly represent human pedestrians. To produce lifelike mannequins for the radar sensors, the mannequin skin should have the same electrical properties as human skin. To ensure that the mannequin provides the same radar cross section (RCS) as a pedestrian in the view of a 77GHz automotive radar, a novel, multi-layer metal fabric mannequin skin that mimics the same electrical properties of real human skin was developed. The Ohio State University\u2019s, Dr. Chen developed, in collaboration with Indiana University and Toyota Motor Corporation, a novel, multi-layer metal fabric for a set of mannequins for pedestrian PCS evaluation. Human skin uniquely responds to electromagnetic waves at different frequencies and this novel artificial skin technology describes a methodology of covering the surface of human surrogates such that they produce similar responses as a real human skin to a 76-77 GHz radar. Surrogates are important in testing the effectiveness of a 76-77 GHz radar in detecting pedestrians. Competing surrogates used for these tests cannot produce realistic responses to a 76-77 GHz radar in all scenarios such as at different looking angles and in motion.

    "ip_description": "A new way to create polymer nanocomposite foam structures with enhanced mechanical properties. Nanotechnology is a constantly growing field, and has a vast potential to change the world for the better. One of the many things products that the nanotechnology field has given to us is the polymer nanocomposite and their foams. This foam has a greater value than traditional plastic foams, since it has inferior mechanical strength, poor surface quality, and low thermal and dimensional stability. It is also difficult to manipulate properly. On the other hand, current nanocomposite foams need a continuous polymer matrix to be able to make a proper structure; without a high concentration of particles, it cannot maintain its intended shape. Therefore, a new way to create nanocomposite foams without a high concentration of particles is essential for the advancement of the field. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. L. Lee, developed a new way to create nanocomposite foams without a high concentration of particles. This was done by using semi-crystalline polymer pellets, coated with functional nanoparticles. The pellets were processed at solid state at elevated temperatures and pressures. To decrease the required pressure, a ultrasound assisted pressure-induced flow (UAPIF) technology was used. Finally, the pellets were saturated with a blowing agent which will allow foaming to occur during the molding process. Commercial Applications: Sealant producers, Luggage lining, Automotive parts manufacturers. Benefits/Advantages: Enhanced tensile strength, Enhanced impact properties, Reduced foam density for polyolefins.",

    "ip_number": "T2021-245",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Introducing cutting-edge soft robotic grippers featuring variable stiffness through positive pressure layer jamming, revolutionizing object manipulation in diverse applications. Automation using robotics has taken many forms including, but not limited to, automotive manufacturing, transportation of good in shipping warehouses, and the delicate handling of wafers in semiconductor plants. In many of these applications grippers and end-of-arm-tools (EOAT\u2019s) are incorporated to allow robotic arms to complete specific tasks. Largely due to these considerations, Mckinsey & Company recently reported that grippers and EOAT\u2019s will grow from a $2.4 billion USD market in 2017 at a rate of 13-14% per annum to become a $5.1 billion USD market in 2023. Traditional rigid-body robotic grippers, however, consist of inflexible arms actuated by a large, unrestrained force. In this regard, damage to the product as well as danger to operators pose potential unwanted risks. Moreover, the rigid body nature of these grippers makes them less capable to handle items of unusual shapes, thereby limiting their applications. To address these concerns, some researchers have begun to develop soft robotic grippers which utilize a compliant structure and an actuating mechanism. Although much better suited for handling delicate and irregular objects, these soft grippers suffer from a limited loading capacity. In addition, many of these robotic grippers utilize complex designs and require expensive materials, thus reducing their feasibility as suitable alternatives. There is, therefore, a need for an easily implemented robotic gripper with tunable stiffness control for interacting with a wide variety of object geometries and materials. To address this need, researchers at The Ohio State University have developed a soft robotic gripper design that employs positive pressure layer jamming, a breakthrough technology enabling more efficient variable stiffness. The finger design comprises a flexible actuator, a flexible backbone, a rigid constraint frame, jamming layers, and a jamming bag. This innovative structure allows for precise control and adaptation to objects of varying shapes and sizes. Furthermore, the use of positive pressure instead of vacuum results in a much more reliable and efficient system. Commercial Applications: * Warehouse Automation: Efficiently handle and sort diverse packages with a single gripper. * Manufacturing: Enhance assembly line efficiency by manipulating objects of different weights and sizes. * Medical Robotics: Facilitate delicate procedures with the gripper's adaptable and gentle grasp. * Agricultural Robotics: Optimize harvesting processes by securely gripping fruits and vegetables. * Logistics and Material Handling: Streamline material transfer with the gripper's versatile capabilities. Benefits/Advantages: * Variable Stiffness: Achieve optimal gripping force, adapting to the specific requirements of different tasks. * Enhanced Payload Capacity: Overcome soft robot limitations, carrying heavier items without compromising safety. * Precision and Adaptability: Improve object manipulation in various industries with the gripper's versatile and controlled movements. * Cost-Efficiency: Reduce the need for multiple grippers by employing a single solution for diverse applications. * Advanced Manufacturing: Benefit from additive manufacturing, allowing for intricate designs and multi-material features.",

    "ip_description": "A real-time visual measurement of six-degree-of-freedom motion with nanometer precision. Conventional microscopic visual feedback systems have limited out-of-plane measurement resolution in the micrometer range, and conventional interferometry systems are inherently not real-time sensors. When dealing with dimensions of sub-micrometer range, small pre-calibration errors, e.g. non-orthogonal transducer axes, can lead to erroneous results, especially in the cases where rotational motion is necessary. Errors such as thermal expansion and sensor drift can be even more critical and will attribute to system variance with respect to the object coordinate frame. A niche for a measurement device that can measure in the nanometer range, as well as in 3D exists. The Ohio State University researchers, led by Dr. Chia-Hsiang Menq, developed a visual measurement device that provides the full pose of multiple 3D micro objects with under ten nanometer precision in x-y-z. The six-degree-of-freedom motion of each object is measured from a single image. No scanning is necessary to obtain 'out-of-plane' motion parameters. This allows real-time positioning and alignment of micro-objects. Therefore, it can serve as a compact motion sensor and can be employed to achieve direct metrology and visual servo control in the object's space with nanometer resolution. This measurement technique can be applied to achieve automatic positioning and engagement in imaging and manipulation of micro objects at micro and nano scales. Applications include dynamic alignment of micro parts, assembly of micro-optical components, assembly of micro mechanical components, assembly of micro sensors and so forth. Benefits/Advantages: Imaging and manipulation of objects at the micro and nano scales.

    "ip_description": "This invention is a vibration free and temperature adjustable sample holder for transmission electron microscopes, allowing improved imaging of beam-sensitive and temperature dependent specimens in the physical sciences. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is used to capture fine detail of specimens less than 100 nm thick making it ideal for physical, chemical, and biological sciences. To generate an image of a physical science specimen, the sample must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures to halt atomic movement. Current cryogenic sample holders use evaporative cooling from liquid nitrogen to stabilize samples. The nitrogen sufficiently cools a sample to 77K, but in the process, the boiling liquid transmits vibrations to the sample thereby distorting the resulting images. Furthermore, this liquid nitrogen process is limited to only one temperature, the boiling point of nitrogen. Therefore, there is a need for an innovative design approach for the TEM sample holder to regulate the temperature of the specimen and eliminate vibrations when viewing samples at the atomic level. Researchers at The Ohio State University\u2019s Center for Electron Microscopy and Analysis have created a sample holder free of vibrations with the ability to cool samples to targeted temperatures of 233K and lower. As compared to traditional nitrogen cooling, this invention gives researchers several distinct advantages with the flexibility of sample temperature and elimination of vibrations. A thermoelectric cooler (TEC) is used to remove heat from the sample. The TEC is a conventional solid-state heat pump, operating without the flow of fluids or gases, and thus without vibrations. Using a TEC allows a sample to reach any temperature between the temperature of the coolant and the maximum cooling capability of the TEC. The TEC can also heat a sample to 333k by reversing the polarity.

Cross-electrophile coupling (XEC) reactions of aryl and alkyl electrophiles are desirable methodologies for C\u2013C bond formation but are limited to specific substrate classes. Couplings of widely-available electrophiles such as aryl chlorides or triflates are currently unknown with any alkyl bromide. There is a need to establish a general solution to the limitations of alkyl-aryl XEC. Dr. Sevov\u2019s technology details a general platform for electroreductive XEC of previously-incompatible electrophiles including tertiary alkyl bromides, aryl chlorides, and aryl/vinyl triflates. Reactions rely on the merger of an electro-chemically-active complex that selectively reacts with alkyl bromides via 1e- processes and an electrochemically-inactive Ni0(phosphine) complex that selectively reacts with aryl electrophiles via 2e- processes. Accessing Ni0(phosphine) intermediates is critical to the strategy but is often challenging. This technology uncovers a previously-unknown pathway for electrochemically-generating these key complexes at mild potentials through a choreographed series of ligand exchange reactions. Beyond the advances to XEC, these findings represent a fundamental solution to reductively accessing highly-reactive Ni0 complexes in preference to the NiI intermediates that currently dominate Ni-redox catalysis. Benefits include expanding C-C bond-forming methodologies as a whole, XEC reactions no longer limited to the canonical couplings of 1\u00b0/2\u00b0 alkyl bromides and aryl iodides/bromides, and reductively accessing highly-reactive Ni0 complexes. Commercial applications include pharmaceuticals, natural product synthesis, agrochemical synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and plastics.",

    "ip_description": "Massive burn injuries present a critical challenge in wound healing and prevention of infection. Current treatment methods are susceptible to blistering and other problems that can reduce engraftment. Cultured epithelial autografts (CEAs) are a vital component in treating large burns, but their susceptibility to blistering and poor engraftment has been a significant limitation. The slow deposition of the basement membrane compounds this issue, leading to fragility, infection risk, and challenging scar management.

Superoleophobic surfaces have a number of advantages including anti-fouling, self-cleaning, anti-smudge, and low-drag. These applications are useful in a number of industries including medical, transportation, aerospace, energy, and construction. Current techniques for creating superoleophobic polycarbonates distribute nanoparticles throughout the polymer, affecting the substrate and reducing mechanical durability. A technique is needed to create a superoleophobic polycarbonate surface without affecting the bulk properties of the material. Dr. Bharat Bhushan and his colleagues at The Ohio State University have developed a novel way to manufacture superoleophobic coatings on the surfaces of polymers. In this invention, a durable superoleophobic polycarbonate has been created through the incorporation of nanoparticles into the polymer surface. Polycarbonate, when exposed to acetone impregnated with nanoparticles, develops a rough, superhydrophobic surface with re-entrant geometry. Since the nanoparticles are only incorporated near the surface and the near-surface region of the polymer, they don\u2019t affect the properties of the bulk material.

As the world becomes more and more connected, the need to secure information between localized components in \u201csensitive\u201d mobile systems has increased dramatically. As attack vectors become more complex, the need to encrypt what is routine traffic between nodes rises. Examples of this communications traffic include the networks used by municipal first responders, tactical radio systems used by the military, and the data streams between car crash alert systems. This invention presents a novel way of securing these channels by using their location in the generation of the encryption keys that protect them. Researchers at The Ohio State University led by Dr. Can Koksal have developed sophisticated mobile encryption software. The proprietary algorithm is based on location information from two mobile nodes which is then used as a key for encryption devices. This development would add an extra layer of encryption to deter potential eavesdroppers from cracking and then listening in on secured communications. The software can also react to the location of the eavesdropper and postpone communications when the eavesdropper has a geographical advantage where the information could be jeopardized. This software is unique in its approach of using localization information as the random source of information, protecting it from attackers. This research is supported by a grant from NSF, and is continuing into the early stages of development.

    "ip_description": "Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is ubiquitous today due to its extremely low energy consumption and relatively large communication coverage. However, the devices communicated through Bluetooth are subject to address tracking attacks, where a nearby attacker can associate Bluetooth addresses to particular users by passively sniffing. To defend against tracking attacks and protect user\u2019s privacy, Bluetooth SIG has provided two countermeasures: (i) address randomization, and (ii) whitelisting. A Bluetooth device can adopt these two features together to achieve strong privacy, which is recommended in the Bluetooth Specification. However, it was discovered that the combined features surprisingly make the privacy of Bluetooth weaker due to a vulnerability in the current system that allows an attacker to reuse the existing randomized address for the whitelisting. As such, a nearby attacker can launch the address tracking by actively probing the whitelisting devices using the previously used random addresses. Dr. Lin Zhiqiang has developed a new protocol to secure the whitelisting protocol. By adding the sequence number in the random address generation and resolution process, in which the previously used random addresses are not allowed to be used any more, the vulnerability is effectively remedied. Commercial Applications: All BLE Industries, Contact tracing, Data privacy/security (Apple/Google have proposed solutions based on BLE).

    "ip_description": "A bio-inspired sidewall design to increase fuel efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Tractor-trailers are essential to the United States (U.S.) economy. The annual value of freight transported in the U.S. in 2017 was $19 trillion, an increase from $18 trillion in 2012. Of the $19 trillion, $13.7 trillion (72%) was transported by the trucking industry. The high fuel consumption by tractor-trailers (approximately 11,818 gallons of fuel per vehicle annually) can be largely attributed to their poor fuel economy (approximately 5.8 miles per gallon), which yields higher fuel costs and significant greenhouse gas emissions. Outside of engine losses, aerodynamic losses account for the largest fraction of fuel consumption for tractor-trailers. Several aerodynamic modifications to the body of the truck and the semi-trailer have yielded promising fuel efficiency results of anywhere from 5% to 10% efficiency increase. Current efforts to improve aerodynamic performance of tractor-trailers focus on optimizing tractor design and implementing drag-reducing trailer add-on structures such as skirts and fairings. However, there is currently no practical implementations of improved trailer sidewall or entire roof design. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led Dr. Shaurya Prakash, have developed a series of novel wall body designs for semi-trailers that can be attached or integrated with the sidewalls or the roof of the trailers. The invention has three explicitly evaluated bio-inspired variations over the existing state-of-the-art planar configuration, which was used as a baseline comparison. The special geometry of the invention is effective in reducing aerodynamic drag by altering the airflow around the tractor-trailer such that the pressure incident upon the rear of the semi-trailer is increased. The advantages of this technology are reduced fuel costs and less frequent refueling for the operator of the tractor trailer. Wind tunnel experiments have proven that this technology reduces the drag coefficient by 12.9%, translating to an estimated savings of 1.6 \u2013 2.3 billion gallons of diesel consumption annually for the entire United Sates trucking industry, given that more than 2.5 million heavy duty trucks are registered across the U.S. Lowering the drag coefficient by 12.9% for a full-scale class 8 tractor-trailer, as reported here, will be equivalent to approximately 6-8% in fuel savings. The inventors have completed computational proof-of-concept as well as a streamlined 6-foot physical prototype to show feasibility of making such a structure with in-lab processes. The prototype meets all design specifications and needs a manufacturing partner to scale-up. Commercial Applications: Automotive and Trailer Design and Manufacturing, Aircraft and Marine Vehicle Design and Manufacturing. Benefits/Advantages: Drag coefficient reduced by 12.9% in wind tunnel experiments, translating to 6-8% in fuel savings for a full-scale class 8 tractor-trailer.",

    "ip_description": "Nucleolin (NCL) is up-regulated in cancer cells, and modulates pro-tumorigenic pathways and chemoresistance. This anti-NCL agent binds and blocks NCL signaling, and may be optimized as cancer therapeutic and diagnostic tool. Despite huge advancements in detection and treatment, cancer remains a top world health concern. One of the major limitations of current technology is adequately detecting tumor margins and micrometastases. Even with aggressive tumor resection and adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, tumor cells often remain at the primary site or elsewhere in the body. Nucleolin (NCL) is one of the most abundant non-ribosomal proteins in the nucleolus, first identified in ribosomal RNA processing. NCL is frequently up-regulated in cancer and cancer-associated endothelial cells compared to normal tissues, where it is also present on the cell surface. Because of its oncogenic role and specific expression on cancer cells surface, NCL represents an attractive target for anti-neoplastic therapies. Several groups have attempted to develop molecules to bind and to inhibit NCL in cancer cells. These compounds have also been suggested as potential carriers for the targeted delivery into cancer cells of several anti-neoplastic agents. Although promising, other agents targeting NCL suffer from intrinsic limitations, such as extremely short half-life, undesired immunostimulatory actions, and still unknown toxicological effects. To overcome some of these limitations, Dr. Croce and his team at The Ohio State University have developed a novel immunoagent that is capable of binding nucleolin (NCL), an abundant protein that is up-regulated on the surface of cancer cells. This agent presents value as a cancer treatment -- it has been shown to be anti-neoplastic _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ for breast cancer; additionally, treatment compounds (chemotherapeutic pro-drugs, radioactive therapeutics) can be joined to the molecule and targeted to cancer cells to potentially improve its efficacy.

    "ip_description": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of irregular cardiac rhythm (arrhythmia), affecting approximately 3% of the US population. It is a significant risk factor for heart failure, ischemic stroke, and sudden cardiac death. The AF mortality rate is growing globally, and risk factors known to increase the incidence of new onset AF include hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, and COVID-19. The mechanisms underlying AF are not well understood. As a consequence, development of new antiarrhythmic drugs has been minimal and current treatments are limited to managing this progressive disease, rather than arresting the underlying pathology. The emphasis of current treatments has been on invasive techniques for radiofrequency or cryo ablation, with a 60%-70% success rate (and frequent need for repeated procedures), as well as new anticoagulant drugs. As such, current treatments merely manage AF symptoms, failing to address its underlying pathology, thereby necessitating more effective therapeutic approaches. Researchers at Ohio State University have developed a groundbreaking technology that focuses on protecting the vascular barrier to prevent vascular leak-induced atrial arrhythmias. The inventors have demonstrated that treatment with peptide or small molecule agents targeting gap junction hemichannels or pannexin channels decreased both incidence and duration of VEGF-A-induced arrhythmias.

    "ip_number": "T2023-119",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "An improvement to the design of ported shrouds for centrifugal compressor resulting in reduced noise and improved efficiency. Implementing a ported shroud casing treatment is often used to extend the operating range of a centrifugal compressor. A centrifugal compressor is used in an engine to increase the pressure of the air entering the engine. This allows the engine to burn more fuel and air, producing more power. Centrifugal compressors are typically used in turbocharged and supercharged automotive engines. The main benefits of using a centrifugal compressor with an engine are: increased power output, fuel efficiency, and faster throttle response. However, the drawback is that it comes with increased cost, increased noise, and reduced reliability. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Richard Dehner, have created a modified ported shroud compressor design to reduce engine whoosh noise and improve engine efficiency. The ported shroud compressor design provides a secondary, parallel flow path to recirculate flow at the inlet of a centrifugal compressor. This recirculated flow increases the flow rate through the inlet of the impeller, which improves stability and performance at low-flow operating points. Traditional non-ported shroud centrifugal compressors suffer from high levels of broadband 'whoosh' noise. Addition of a traditional ported shroud significantly reduces 'whoosh' noise, but it also greatly increases tonal noise at the impeller blade-pass frequency (BPF). Increased tonal noise is well known throughout the automotive industry to be a drawback to traditional ported shroud compressors. The OSU ported shroud design modification maintains the 'whoosh' noise reduction and does not increase BPF noise, which results in a much quieter compressor and improved efficiency according to simulations. Commercial Applications: Diesel (compression ignition or CI) engines utilizing a ported shroud centrifugal compressor, Gasoline (spark ignition or SI) engines Ported shroud centrifugal compressor, Mobile (vehicle) or stationary (such as HVAC, power generators, etc.) engines as listed above with a ported shroud centrifugal compressor. Benefits/Advantages: Substantial reduction of whoosh noise, Increased engine efficiency, Reduced BPF noise, Improved stability and performance at low operating points.",

Silicon is one of the most widely used materials for integrated optics due to its high index contrast with SiO2, low material absorption in the fiber optic communication bands (1260 \u2013 1660 nm wavelength), and compatibility with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processing. However, relatively little progress has been made towards an electrically driven silicon-based light source, a fundamental device required for fully functional photonic circuits.

Additionally, light emitted by the bandgap transition (~1100 nm wavelength) is outside the fiber optic communication window, and is within silicon\u2019s absorption band which is not suitable for on chip signal routing.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The Need: Glutamate is a major neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) and essential for normal brain function including cognition, memory, and learning. However, the extracellular concentration of glutamate must remain below excitotoxic levels (~ 1 \u03bcM) to avoid overstimulation of glutamate receptors, leading to neuronal damage or death. Excitotoxicity has been associated with multiple acute neurological conditions such as ischemic stroke, epilepsy, and trauma, chronic adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and depression. One potential approach to preventing excitotoxicity is to enhance glutamate reuptake. EAAT2 is the major glutamate transporter and functions to remove glutamate from synapses. An increase in EAAT2 protein expression and function can provide a means to prevent insufficient glutamate reuptake and consequently reduce neuronal damage.\n\nThe Technology: Drs. Chien-Liang (Glenn) Lin and Kevin Hodgetts have developed a series of compounds that increase EAAT2 protein expression and their lead compound, LH-1, shows great promise as an Alzheimer's therapeutic. In vivo mouse data demonstrates that treatment with LH-1 results in increased EAAT2 expression in the brains of wildtype mice.\n\nAdministering a daily dose LH-1 at a 10mg/kg to a neurodegenerative mouse model, Tau mouse, resulted in a statistically significant restoration in cognitive function.\n\nStage of Development: LH-1 has been identified as the lead compound and the inventors have funding from the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation and have completed GLP toxicology studies.

    "ip_number": "T2020-163",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Implementation of Halbach array cladding magnets to focus magnetic flux to improve specific torque output of magnetic gearing systems. Magnetic gears exploit modulation of rotor magnetic field harmonics to perform gearing operations with only bearing contact between the parts of non-zero relative velocity. A magnetic outer rotor, magnetic inner rotor, and flux modulator operate in concert to either decrease or increase the speed of a shaft while increasing or decreasing the torque of the shaft. The absence of contact between these three moving parts offers distinct advantages over conventional gearing systems, including protection against overload damage, a limited need for lubrication, reduced noise and vibration, and the ability to be directly incorporated into motors and generators. Implementation of magnetic gearing systems may help drive innovation in the field of space travel where traditional lubrication requirements make application in zero gravity difficult. Their limited maintenance requirements indicate that these systems also have potential uses in machines that operate in remote locations such as offshore drilling rigs and large wind turbines. Current magnetic gear configurations, however, generate end-effect losses that contribute to 65%-85% of overall magnetic efficiency losses. There is, therefore, a need for a magnetic gearing system that increases the overall magnetic efficiency and torque transmission by mitigating end-effect losses. To address this need, researchers in The Ohio State University\u2019s Smart Materials and Structures Lab, led by Dr. Marcelo Dapino, have created a magnetic gearing system which utilizes Halbach array cladding magnets to improve magnetic efficiency. Halbach array cladding magnets are permanent magnetic materials that have a magnetization vector with a non-zero axial component. The permanent magnets of the Halbach array cladding magnets are arranged to focus magnetic flux towards one side of the array. By focusing the magnetic flux axially in this manner, end-effect losses can be significantly reduced such that a greater proportion of flux is preserved and available for torque contribution. Indeed, simulations with a magnetic gear system configured with axial-end Halbach array cladding magnets showed a 10% increase in specific torque output for a machine design of similar size or weight. Commercial Applications: Distributed electric propulsion for manned and unmanned small aircraft. These aircraft are often limited by noise requirements and magnetic gearing could be a useful solution to this problem for novel applications like city air taxis. Smaller scale use in automotive vehicles such as gearing for electric seat adjustment. Gearing for spacecraft where traditional lubrication requirements make application in zero gravity difficult. Gearing for 'hard to reach' places which could greatly benefit from reduced maintenance requirements. Benefits/Advantages: A 10% increase in specific torque output compared to conventional gearing systems of similar size or weight. Significantly reduced end-effects loss in magnetic efficiency. Reduces the output power needed to generate lift. Improves efficiency of the drone's power supply. Torque requirements can be met with less mass, which improves design flexibility and system efficiency. Torque requirements can be met with a lower volume of magnetically active material which reduces cost of the magnetic gear design. Research Interest: The Ohio State University laboratory that developed this novel magnetic gear design has expertise in the modeling of magnetic gearing systems for both general and aerospace applications. They specialize in 2D and 3D finite element modeling (FEM), analytical modeling, and representative experiment design for model validation. The lab is focused on design optimization to improve torque and efficiency performance, innovative methods for reduced computation time of magnetic gear models, and experimental design and fabrication of a cladding magnet gear.

    "ip_description": "The Need\nRadiation pattern measurement/characterization is one of the key final steps in the performance verification and documentation of industrial antennas. One method of testing radiation pattern of an antenna is use of a very controlled test environment that is expensive to build and maintain. Another method of testing is to use small probe antennas in the near-field, then use mathematical methods to find the radiation pattern for the far-field. These tests are highly sensitive to positional repeatability of the probe antennas. Also, this method of testing requires that the interval samples be shorter than \u00bd the wavelength of interest, which is not viable for at millimeter-wave and terahertz frequencies, where wavelengths are extremely short.

Conventional Doherty PAs, while popular, are inherently narrowband due to their reliance on a quarter-wave transmission line (TL).

The Need: As our technology becomes increasingly complex, so does the quantity and variation of the Embedded Digital Device [EDD] components that are required within the project. Because not every device is made perfectly to specifications due to a propagation of random error, it is important to have a diverse, efficient testing process to avoid a facility's vulnerability to Common Caused Failure [CCF] (especially in the field of Nuclear Power). The Technology: A team of Engineers at The Ohio State University have researched and proposed a model to extend code-level mutation testing (Testing the functionality of an EDD relative to its Software Requirements Specification [SRS]) to the requirements and design level (Testing the functionality of an EDD relative to its Software Design Description [SDD]) by using a High level Extended Finite-State Machine figure [HLEFSM]. They then developed an Automated Mutation Testing Tool [AMuTT] that develops mutants, or changes, the logical gates, operators and operands in the software, and then tries to differentiate, or kill, the mutants by comparing the HLEFSM of a mutated EDD to the technical specifications of an ideal EDD, modelled by a HLEFSM of the SRS/SDD. A mutation score can then be calculated by taking the proportion of killed mutants to the total number of mutants generated. Commercial Applications: * Reduces 75% of the current cost of mutation testing while keeping a mutation score (effectiveness) above 99%. * Can be marketed outside of nuclear engineering toward any organization that uses EDD's and is prone to CCF.

Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) are robust molecular recognition elements able to mimic natural recognition entities, such as antibodies and biological receptors, useful to separate and analyze complicated samples such as biological fluids and environmental samples. This is a commonly utilized process, but it needs improved thermal and chemical stability to allow for a longer lifetime. Other drawbacks to MIPs include template bleeding, tedious synthesis procedure, scarce control of its physical form, and difficulties in scaling up its production. The Ohio State University researchers, led by Dr. Susan Olesik, developed a method of preparing a molecularly-imprinted pyrolyzed photoresist (MI-PP). The invention has a carbon surface that has been imprinted on the molecular level for a specific molecule of interest; the imprinted carbon surface can bind the molecule in a highly specific fashion.

Ga2O3 is a promising ultra-widebandgap semiconductor with many applications in power switching and RF electronics. Realizing those improvements requires efficient field management design to prevent premature breakdown due to electric field crowding at the device edges. There is a need to develop techniques for manufacturing that result in a higher breakdown field. Dr. Siddharth Rajan, along with a team at The Ohio State University, have developed a novel surface barrier method using AlGaO or GaO. For example, the method involves deposition of AlGaO and/or GaO between multiple electrode layers and an optional dielectric layer. In some configurations, there may be only Ga2O3 between the electrodes. In other cases, there may be an additional layer of graded (AlxGa1-x)2O3 in addition to the layer of Ga2O3.

The approach developed demonstrates that alkyl Sn precursors can effect catalytic site structures and help produce more open sites than currently used compounds. Experiments conducted demonstrate that combinations such as Me-Sn-Cl3 produced the most active catalyst for alcohol ring-opening (ARO) when tested with epichlorohydrin and methanol; while Ph-Sn-Cl3 is more active than Me-Sn-Cl3 for ARO when using 1, 2-epoxyhexane and methanol. In this manner, different alkylated Sn precursors characterized by the inventors enable optimal compound configurations for use in different chemical processes and improve efficiencies. Chemical processes, such as Baeyer\u2013Villiger oxidation reaction and related biomass conversions, benefit from using the compounds developed in this approach, like Lewis acid zeolite Sn-beta compounds of the type.

    "ip_description": "With a high theoretical breakdown field strength, \u03b2-Ga2O3 has the potential to be useful in power switching and high frequency power amplifying devices. For any device technology to be competitive, damage free etching techniques are necessary. All current dry etching recipes in \u03b2-Ga2O3 have been found to cause significant subsurface damage resulting in charge depletion. Additionally, wet etching recipes are form angled sidewalls making it difficult to form highly scaled fins and trench structures. There is an unmet need to create sub-micron (~100 nm) 3 dimensional structures such as fins, trenches, nano-pillars etc., with vertical sidewalls. Dr. Siddharth Rajan, along with other researchers at The Ohio State University have developed a damage free etching of Ga2O3 using Ga flux for fabricating high aspect ratio 3D structures. Previous experiments on MBE growth of \u03b2-Ga2O3 showed that exposure of Ga on \u03b2-Ga2O3 surface held at high temperature (> ~500 ) without supplying active oxygen results in the formation of gallium suboxide. The gallium suboxide being a volatile component desorbs from the surface and effectively results in etching of the \u03b2-Ga2O3 epilayer.

    "ip_description": "This MIMO-PLC architecture is the first scalable MIMO architecture on a single power line. It improves the throughput for power line communication (PLC) by utilizing the existing power delivery infrastructure and allows for high data rates in rural areas. The Need: Home networking and the Internet of Things (IoT), especially voice and video communications, require high throughput, reliable coverage, and sustainable connectivity. However, the performance is dramatically decreased when the wireless signals go through the walls and ceilings. The densely deployed WiFi can serve a larger place, but the frequency handoff will decrease the throughput. Also, the IoT requires the deployment of many sensors such as cameras, smart thermostats, home energy monitors, and smart irrigation controllers throughout a space to collect sensing data. Collecting the sensing data from all of these IoT devices simultaneously with a wireless connection is not possible because of coverage of wireless signals. In most remote rural areas, there are no Ethernet connection and wireless signals like LTE are too weak to be usable. Thus, there is a need to leverage the existing power delivery infrastructure and achieve a high data rate, reliable coverage, and sustainable connectivity. The Technology: A team of Ohio State University researchers, led by Dr. Kannan Athreya, have developed a Multiple Input Multiple Output Power Line Communication (MIMO-PLC) architecture, which is the first scalable MIMO architecture on a single power line. It improves the throughput for PLC by utilizing the existing power delivery infrastructure and by distributing transmitter nodes and receiver nodes along the power line. With this technology, the cost and time of installing Ethernet and base stations in rural areas can be avoided as the architecture can provide internet service as long as power line infrastructure exists. In comparison to the conventional MIMO-PLC architecture which suffers from high spatial correlation, this MIMO-PLC architecture efficiently utilizes the power line to achieve high throughput gain and scalability.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Coatings are broadly used to protect metallic structures from corrosion. However, aggressive acidic and alkaline conditions can both develop locally on the coated metal surface due to corrosion, leading to the failure of the coated structure. Commonly used smart coatings use a timed release of special compounds in response to stimuli experienced during the start of the corrosion process. One important limitation in conventional smart coatings is the ability to react to _only_ acidic or basic pH \u2013thus protecting against either, but not both. Hence, the need for a smart coating capable of providing comprehensive protection against different environmental situations appears critical for many applications.\n\nThe design developed here consists of micro/nanocontainers with two weak electrolytes (i.e., polyethylenimine (PEI) and polyacrylic acid (PAA)) that act as corrosion inhibitors. When mixed, electrostatic interaction between the two compounds results in coacervates forming. These coacervates demonstrate different behaviors when low or high pH is present and can effectively prevent or slow corrosion effects of the base structure in both settings. The micro/nanocontainers made from such coacervates with special compounds can be embedded inside a barrier coating and get activated depending on the pH of the environment that the coating is exposed. The capsule size is alterable to achieve enhanced performance in terms of corrosion protection, such as sealing voids that could develop as the inhibitors are consumed. Thus, the invention provides a comprehensive release mechanism embedded into a barrier polymer matrix triggered by either low or high pH.\n\nExtensive use of different metal substrates on the surface of different equipment types benefits from using this invention as an anti-corrosive measure. Surfaces and other areas in automotive, aircraft, liquid transportation vehicles, marine, and medical equipment represent applications where this invention\u2019s novel aspects would be critically beneficial.\n\nIn addition to providing corrosion inhibition/protection, the release system can be modified to indicate the presence of corrosion at an early stage. So important elements in an application (e.g., airplane engine blades) are appropriately reinforced or replaced promptly. The design is also easy and inexpensive to manufacture compared with other conventional approaches.",

    "ip_description": "A new process to fabricate stretchable and flexible wire antennas with conductive fibers (E-fibers). Current processes to manufacture flexible, mechanically durable antennas on E-fibers yield non-stretchable prototypes and lack fine print details. The geometric accuracy of printed antennas is less than 1 mm, and the devices are prone to failure due to fatigue and wear from deformation. The antennas can also be complicated and difficult to reproduce. Thus, current products are not suitable for applications that require high flexibility and are subject to continuous mechanical deformation. An innovative technology that can withstand deformation, maintain excellent performance, and print with high geometrical accuracy is needed. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. John L. Volakis, have developed a fabrication process for stretchable and flexible wire antennas with conductive fibers (or E-fibers). During this process, the wire antenna is embroidered using E-fibers and embedding into a flexible polymer with a printed geometrical accuracy of 0.3 mm. The resulting E-fiber antenna can endure repetitive deformations and corrosion. Initial tests in truck tires to transmit their history, temperature, pressure, and stress have shown comparable performance to that of their copper foil and copper wire counterparts. Commercial Applications: Consumer wearable electronics, Automotive, Healthcare, Military.

Organizations can then leverage this decision-making to improve their security without increasing costs. Therefore, there is a need for new algorithms that can facilitate this process. Researchers at The Ohio State University led by Dr. Theodore Allen have developed the Learning Optimal Empirical Reward iNtelligence (LOERN) tool, a breakthrough problem solving approach that can solve fundamental problems in machine learning, including how to offer optimal actions in the context of parametric uncertainty, and to optimize learning immediately from observations. This technique has significant advantages compared to the Markov Decision Processes commonly used in machine learning. The primary application of LOERN relates to reducing the maintenance costs associated with cyber security. By selecting optimal policies addressing data limitations, losses from stolen information and maintenance costs can be balanced. LOERN is an engine that can adapt, nuance, and derive cyber policy. Commercial Applications: Cyber Security, Machine Learning. Benefits/Advantages: Existing Markov Decision Processes approach requires assumptions about transition matrices and costs. Over current security systems in place, LOERN processing generates decisions that lead to save millions in savings from data loss and cyber security maintenance.

Various market segments such as automotive and aerospace continue to seek more ways to 'lightweight' their vehicles using more aluminum, magnesium, titanium and other low-weight alloys in place of heavier alloys. This also includes composites. To incorporate these lightweighting materials into a structure, it is often necessary to join dissimilar metals in a way that provides far supprior mechanical properties and stability beyond traditional adhesives and mechanical fasteners. This is a complex and difficult problem that requires a unquie solution. The Ohio State University and Honda R&D Americas, led by Dr. Marcelo Dapino of Ohio State and Dr. Ryan Hahnlen of Honda, have developed a transition structure that includes a metallic portion, a fiber portion including a plurality of tows embedded within the metallic portion and extending out from the metallic portion forming a fabric, and a binding material forming a matrix surrounding the fiber portion embedded within the metallic portion. The fiber portion may be attached to or form part of a composite omponent. The transition structure may join a metallic component and a composite component. The transition structure may be manufactured by creating first channels within a layer of a metallic substrate, inserting fiber tows into the first channels, placing a first metallic layer over the metallic substrate and the fiber tows, consolidating the metallic layer to the metallic substrate, and binding the fiber tows within a resin. Prior to binding, additional layers of channels and fiber tows may be consolidated onto the first metallic layer. This approach is captured in United States Patents 10,807,186 and 11,511,367.

Moreover, OVs can stimulate the immune system against the tumor cells, influencing the development of the body\u2019s natural antitumor response. Although there are over 40 clinical trials for OVs, only one has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of melanoma.

    "ip_description": "Coral reefs are declining at an alarming rate. When temperatures increase by as little as 1-2 \u00b0C above their normal thermal maximum for as little as ten days, corals become stressed, lose their endosymbiotic algae, and turn white \u2013 hence the term bleaching. When bleached, corals do not get photosynthetic sugars produced photosynthetically by their endosymbiotic algae and are starved of this food source. Natural reef recovery from bleaching events can take decades or longer. Since corals are the building blocks of coral reefs, their demise means the breakdown and eventual collapse of reef ecosystem function. Reefs provide habitat for 25% of all marine species, provide coastal protection from storms and erosion, support the tourism industry, and are estimated to have an annual economic value of USD 9.9 Trillion. Solutions to minimize the impact of bleaching and enhance recovery are imperative.\n\nCorals also get nutrition from eating zooplankton. The Underwater Zooplankton Enhancing Light Array (UZELA) is an autonomous, battery-powered, submersible device deployed on the reef floor. It shines a light toward the surface at multiple locations on a coral reef to enhance the local abundance of zooplankton and increases coral feeding opportunities allowing the coral to maintain their nutritional needs, recover more quickly, and minimize mortality. Enhancing feeding in corals grown in nurseries, on restored reefs, and on impacted reefs will improve their growth rates and reduce their susceptibility to heat stress.\n\nGovernment organizations, coral restoration projects, conservation managers, coral jewelry industries, and researchers would be the target users most likely to adopt this technology.

    "ip_number": "T2019-044",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Novel protein and apoprotein purification strategies are valuable tools with a wide variety of medical and research applications. While there are existing techniques for protein and apoprotein purification, some of these have flaws such as the use of harsh denaturants, highly flammable solvents, low yields, cumbersome manufacturing processes, and high capital and operating expenses. Furthermore, they are not easily scalable, which inhibits their applications for expanded use. Therefore, effective, scalable, and safe methods for protein and apoprotein purification are needed.\n\nNew therapeutic protein complexes and cocktails can provide comprehensive treatment of complex disease states such as hemolysis. For example, although hemolysis is a multifaceted process, current approaches have mainly focused on single protein therapies towards neutralizing each of the toxic species produced during hemolysis. Thus, efficient therapeutic solutions need to be developed to treat all the major toxic byproducts of hemolysis.\n\nDr. Andre Palmer and colleagues at The Ohio State University and University of California at San Diego have developed a novel method for apoprotein manufacturing and several methods for general protein purification, along with a novel, deliverable protein complex for use in various medical applications. These methods utilize various techniques to purify individual protein components, protein cocktails (i.e., protein mixtures), and complexes of interest. For example, some of the proteins purified include apohemoglobin (apoHb), haptoglobin (Hp), and the apoHb-Hp complex.\n\nWith this invention, the Palmer group have developed a method for separating small hydrophobic ligands from proteins, such as heme from hemoglobin (Hb) or metabolites and lipids from human serum albumin (HSA). This method allows for purification of apoproteins, such as apoHb and ligand-free HSA.\n\nThis novel technology does not require the use of specialized equipment, is relatively inexpensive, and easily scalable. Furthermore, this technology has the potential to be applied to any ligand-associated protein to produce the resultant apoprotein.\n\nWith a wide variety of medical applications, this method represents a breakthrough in the manufacturing of apoproteins. Large-scale manufacturing of apoproteins opens-up a new approach to facilitate small molecule drug transport _in vivo._ These proteins may be used for targeted drug delivery, bioimaging, and/or scavenging of toxic molecules during various disease states. Furthermore, these apoproteins could be used in various medical treatments, such as drug delivery for certain cancers. There are also other prospective applications for this technology: currently purified serum proteins may be made free of lipids and metabolites, thus improving their therapeutic index.\n\nHaptoglobin (Hp) is a valuable plasma protein with various medical applications. The Palmer group have refined a method to readily obtain isolated polymeric forms of Hp from plasma or plasma fractions with minimal contamination from other serum proteins or components. Hp can bind cell-free Hb, which allows Hp to be used as a treatment for a variety of medical conditions characterized by states of hemolysis. Therefore, since the Hp-Hb complex can target CD163+ macrophages and monocytes, Hp may be used for targeted drug delivery in combination with Hb and/or Hb-like molecules such as apoHb (see **Therapeutic Uses of Protein Complexes** below).\n\nFurthermore, with the use of their method of separation, Dr. Palmer\u2019s group is capable of isolating protein cocktails (i.e. protein mixtures) for enhanced treatment of states of hemolysis. One of these cocktails is capable of binding and detoxifying cell-free Hb, cell-free heme and free iron. During disease states characterized by hemolysis, the rupture of red blood cells (RBCs) leads to the build-up of these toxic species in the circulation. Previous therapies have mainly focused on scavenging single toxic species (i.e. Hb, heme or iron). Yet, with the use of the protein scavenging cocktail, the treatment would detoxify the entire set of toxic components of hemolysis (i.e. Hb, heme and iron).\n\nThe technology developed for isolation of Hp from plasma or plasma fractions can also be applied to purify other plasma proteins, concentrates and cocktails including Factor I, Factor VIII, Factor X, Von Willebrand factor, Fibrinogen, Fibronectin, Protein C, Ceruloplasmin, serum albumin, prothrombin, and immunoglobulins.\n\nThis method also provides an advancement in the field of protein purification. The main technique for purifying proteins is column chromatography. However, chromatography is an expensive technique with highly specialized equipment and specific separation conditions for each protein. Furthermore, in some types of chromatography, such as affinity chromatography, the process may require the use of harsh solvents to purify the target protein. With the use of their method, the process has the benefit of being easily scalable to accommodate the large volumes of plasma processed by the plasma protein industry. Therefore, this novel method represents a more effective, less expensive, and more easily scalable protein purification method versus column chromatography.\n\nWith this invention, the Palmer group have developed a method for isolating specific target proteins from complex protein/particulate mixtures. The method uses a target protein binding molecule (TPBM) that allows for the purification of the desired protein. This process yields purified proteins, which can then be used in various medical or research applications.\n\nThis method is an improvement on current technology for several reasons. First, the use of specific TPBMs allows for the targeting and isolation of proteins specific to the researcher or manufacturer\u2019s needs. Also, the method is inexpensive and less cumbersome compared to current technologies, promoting ease of use and wider applicability. This technology is versatile and can be used to purify a variety of proteins.\n\nThe researchers have created unique protein complexes that have a wide variety of medical applications. One product is synthetically made apoHb-Hp protein complexes. One medical application of this technology is for treatment of various states of hemolysis, where these complexes can be administered to detoxify both cell-free Hb and cell-free heme. Moreover, this complex can be used as a drug or bioimaging agent carrier. For example, apoHb-Hp can target CD163+ macrophages and monocytes, thus potentially delivering chemotherapeutic drugs or other types of drugs more effectively to these cells.\n\nThis technique is an improved method to treat hemolysis because it allows for the scavenging of both cell-free Hb and cell-free heme with a single molecule. There is a need for novel treatments to detoxify the byproducts of hemolysis. This technology therefore represents an advancement in the field that could provide more robust treatment for conditions such as hemolysis, and more efficacious drug delivery for conditions such as cancer.\n\nCommercial Applications\n*   Drug delivery\n*   Bioimaging\n*   Detoxification of byproducts of hemolysis\n*   Protein purification\n*   Apoprotein purification\n*   Detoxification of RBC blood products\n*   Additive to prolong the ex vivo storage lifetime of blood\n*   Plasma protein concentrates\n\nBenefits/Advantages\n*   Inexpensive\n*   High yield\n*   Scalable\n*   More efficacious than current methods\n*   Less cumbersome than available methods",

As the industry embraces the certification of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles with unique configurations, there is a growing demand for a safe and accurate flight-test methodology that positively identifies flutter margins without exposing the aircraft to flutter. Addressing this need is crucial to enhance aircraft safety and support the development of innovative aerial technologies. Our groundbreaking technology, the Parametric Flutter Margin (PFM) method, offers a cutting-edge solution to accurately identify the flutter margins of aircraft without the need for hazardous high-pressure flight conditions. The PFM method involves adding a stabilizing mass ahead of the elastic axis of the aircraft's lifting surface, enabling data collection at flight conditions exceeding the nominal aircraft's flutter boundary. Utilizing a self-contained electro-mechanical excitation system and advanced Frequency Response Functions (FRFs), the PFM method allows for precise analysis of an aircraft's aeroelastic system at the flutter onset speed, eliminating the need for extrapolation to higher velocities. By combining numerical simulations and physical experiments, the PFM method provides a reliable and safe means to assess an aircraft's flutter characteristics during both ground vibration tests and flight-testing. Commercial Applications: Certification of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): Ensure the safe and reliable certification of UAVs with unique configurations for commercial operations, promoting the growth of the drone industry. Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Vehicle Certification: Support the certification of UAM vehicles with innovative designs, enabling efficient and safe urban air transportation. Aircraft Safety Enhancement: Enhance aircraft safety by accurately identifying flutter margins, leading to the development of more robust and reliable aircraft designs. Benefits/Advantages: Enhanced Safety: By enabling flutter margin identification without subjecting the aircraft to hazardous flight conditions, the PFM method significantly enhances aircraft safety during the certification process. Efficient Certification: The PFM method streamlines the certification process by providing accurate flutter data, reducing the need for extensive and risky flight-testing campaigns. Innovation Support: With the ability to certify unique aircraft configurations, the PFM method encourages innovation and the development of advanced aerial technologies. Accurate Flutter Prediction: The PFM method's close agreement with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) predictions ensures accurate flutter onset velocity estimation, enhancing confidence in the aircraft's structural dynamics.",

Lisa Militello and Asimina Kiourti, have created fabrics that can automatically calculate height, weight, and BMI of a patient. The subject can be placed anywhere on a mat for measurement, and the concept is scalable to any desired fabric size or accuracy. The system is portable, so it can be used in the office of a care provider or at home. Children whose heights or growth rates fall outside of the normal range can be identified as having short stature (less than the 3rd percentile) or tall stature (above the 97th percentile) or as having abnormal growth velocity. Serial height measurements over time are key to identifying these patterns. Conventional infantometer and stadiometer technologies restrict height monitoring to sporadic intervals, are prone to error, and measurements at a well-child visit decline with age and are sometimes unavailable to children who are uninsured. While short and tall stature are usually caused by individual differences in a normal growth pattern, sometimes it can be an indication of underlying pathologies. A way to monitor height on a more regular, unobtrusive manner could help with early detection or monitoring of Turner syndrome, Crohn's disease, short stature, Celiac disease, growth hormone deficiency, and obesity, among others.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "Patients diagnosed with advanced liposarcoma (LPS) face a significant treatment challenge, as current chemotherapy approaches exhibit low response rates of only 25%, leading to a dismal overall survival at 5 years, ranging between 20% to 34%. Despite extensive efforts, there has been no substantial improvement in prognosis for nearly two decades. The aggressive clinical behavior of LPS and its resistance to chemotherapy have been linked to the aberrant activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. However, existing attempts to target AKT clinically have not yielded successful outcomes. A critical need exists for a novel therapeutic technology that can effectively combat LPS by targeting AKT in a precise and efficient manner. Researchers at The Ohio State University have discovered how the phosphorylation of the transcription elongation factor IWS1 by AKT contributes to LPS tumor biology and have developed novel compounds designed to inhibit IWS1. By targeting IWS1, we aim to disrupt the AKT-mediated phosphorylation process that promotes the maintenance of cancer stem cells and contributes to a 'metastable' cell phenotype characterized by mesenchymal/epithelial plasticity. This cutting-edge approach offers a promising solution to combat LPS progression and metastasis effectively. Benefits/Advantages: Enhanced Treatment Efficacy: By specifically targeting IWS1, our inhibitors have the potential to significantly improve response rates and overall survival in patients with advanced liposarcoma. This breakthrough approach may revolutionize LPS treatment and outcomes, providing a positive impact on patient lives. Reduced Side Effects: As our technology selectively targets the AKT pathway through IWS1 inhibition, it may lead to reduced off-target effects commonly associated with conventional chemotherapy. This ensures a more tolerable treatment experience for patients, enhancing their quality of life during therapy. Potential for Combination Therapies: Our IWS1 inhibitors open new possibilities for combination therapies, complementing existing treatment modalities and potentially enhancing their efficacy. The versatility of this technology allows for integration into comprehensive treatment strategies tailored to individual patients.",

However, challenges exist in the controlled doping of semi-insulating layers of \u03b2-Ga2O3, limiting the material\u2019s full potential as a new platform for electronics engineering. Needed is a method of manufacturing semi-insulating layers that maximizes the advantages of \u03b2-Ga2O3 while overcoming the existing difficulties in controlled doping of the material. A novel method to manufacture high-quality, carbon-doped semi-insulating \u03b2-Ga2O3 layers without introducing additional acceptors. The method uses trimethylgallium (TMGa) as the Ga precursor.

    "ip_description": "A novel hybrid adhesive that combines the non-toxic, high strength properties of methacrylate adhesives with the bonding characteristics of polyurethanes. Despite the utility of methacrylate adhesive chemistry, applications have been limited to industrial and biomedical use cases. This is due to the curing mechanism, which is initiated by either heat, light or a two-component redox system. This invention describes two strategies to create a single-component methacrylate adhesive system, in which the polymerization/curing reaction is triggered by ambient moisture or by physical contact between two surfaces. This eliminates the need for mixing or an external energy stimulus to initiate curing, which saves time and subsequently costs. Ohio State University researchers Drs. Scott Schricker and Jon Parquette have co-developed a novel hybrid adhesive technology that allows for rapid curing, without generating by-products that would reduce the adhesive strength of the compound. This hybrid process can be initiated in two ways. One way is to utilize a catalyst composed of two compounds. The other way involves the encapsulation of a large hydrophobic organic compound in microcapsules. The organic compounds prevent the polymerization process from occuring prematurely, but once the capsules break following contact with another surface the adhesive is activated and the polymerization process is initiated. Commercial Applications: Industrial materials bonding, Consumer adhesives, Construction materials bonding. Benefits/ Advantages: Curing of adhesive is triggered by either moisture in the air or by physical contact between two surfaces.

    "ip_description": "A technique for estimating magnetic resonance imaging absolute phase to enhance machine efficiency and versatility. Estimating absolute phase of Radiofrequency (RF) field including both the transmit field and receive sensitivity is very important for various stages of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure. It can be used for mulit-transmit, RF shimming, parallel imaging reconstruction, electric property contrast, and MRI RF safety. Over the last decade, prominent MRI scanner manufacturers and entities across the MRI community have filed more than 30 patents covering efforts to estimate the in vivo electric property, and over 100 publications have addressed some aspect of this problem. Current state of the art methods to conduct absolute phase estimation are not perfect due to the inherent inaccuracy of approximate estimates. Additionally, these methods are only available for specific transmit coil systems including birdcage transceiver coils and multi-transmit coils. Researchers at the Ohio State University, led by Dr. Jinghua Wang, have developed a system and method for estimating absolute phase of RF by integrating transmit system configuration. This technology eliminates the need for approximation, thus providing more accurate estimation of absolute phase. Additionallly, the technology aims to play a significant role in the development of new MRI methods such as parallel RF pulse design, computation of RF shim weights, correction for inhomogeneity in image analysis, image reconstruction, and RF safety. Commercial Applications: MRI Hardware Design, Image Reconstruction Technology, Advanced MRI Techniques, Image Artifact Reduction and Image Analysis. Benefits/Advantages: Currently, commercialized MRI scanners recommend accelerated factor of 2 to 3 for parallel image acquisition, while the new technology can produce an accelerated factor of 5 to 7.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The Problem:\n\nMastitis is the both the most common and most expensive disease in the dairy industry. When it occurs in dairy cows, mastitis leads to deterioration in milk production and quality that causes a decrease in profitability. Therefore, early detection of bacterial infection in the udders is imperative to producers. While clinical mastitis causes changes in the milk that are visible to the eye, subclinical mastitis is difficult to diagnose and therefore is more prevalent and has a greater economic impact due to long-term effects on yield. For this reason, there is substantial interest in developing a diagnostic tool that can detect subclinical mastitis as early as possible.\n\nThere are several currently used tools for detecting subclinical mastitis. While direct examination of udders and milk culturing are traditional and effective methods, they are time consuming and not feasible at scale. Therefore, cellular and molecular diagnostic techniques using milk sampling such as cow-side antigen tests to detect pathogens and somatic cell counts, which are positively correlated with mastitis severity, are employed to improve the likelihood of detecting mastitis. However, these technologies are still difficult to scale for large herds, and the dairy industry would benefit from a high-throughput molecular tool that could diagnose subclinical mastitis with the accuracy of currently employed, low-throughput tests.\n\nThe Solution:\n\nResearchers at The Ohio State University led by Dr. Benjamin Enger have developed a method for using Raman spectroscopy to identify subclinical mastitis by detecting the biochemical changes in milk that accompany infection. When a cow experiences infection, the composition of its milk undergoes substantial change. Therefore, this method exploits mastitis-associated change in composition to discriminate milk from healthy cows from milk that displays molecular signatures indicating the presence of infection. Using Raman spectroscopy in this way presents a new, high-throughput approach to detecting subclinical mastitis that could provide high-resolution information for herds of any size and maximize their quality of product.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n*   High-throughput method to diagnose subclinical mastitis\n*   Exploits the biochemical signatures of mastitis as a diagnostic tool\n*   Easier to scale for large herds versus cow-side diagnostic tests that are currently in use",

Papaverine is an FDA-approved phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitor and its clinical use is due to these effects on blood pressure and vascular tone. However, it was found to also be a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I. Papaverine\u2019s mitochondrial complex I inhibition has been shown to be responsible for increased tumor oxygenation and enhanced radiation response. But, when used in oncology, papaverine\u2019s vascular effects can cause negative side-effects, especially in patients with cardiovascular co-morbidities.\n\n**The Need**\nIn the field of radiation therapy, tumor hypoxia poses a significant challenge, dampening the efficacy of treatment and limiting the biologically effective dose. Hypoxic tumors are inherently resistant to treatment by radiotherapy. Investigators have known this for over 50 years, and yet there is not an efficient way to radiosensitize this subgroup of solid tumors. Hypoxia exists because of an inherent mismatch in the delivered oxygen versus the consumed oxygen within the tumor. Many groups have tried to deliver more oxygen to the tumor, but this has been ineffective clinically. Effective treatments that prepare the tumor cell to respond to radiotherapy are needed to improve patient outcomes.\n\n**The Technology**\nResearchers at The Ohio State University have developed novel compounds that harness the power of mitochondrial respiration modulation to elevate tumor oxygenation and amplify the tumor\u2019s response to radiation therapy while removing the unwanted vascular effects of papaverine. These novel derivatives of papaverine provide for a breakthrough radiosensitizing strategy by offering improved effectiveness with potentially fewer side effects. The novel compounds have been designed to retain the mitochondrial C1 inhibiting activity while removing the PDE10A activity.

    "ip_description": "Lactose from cheese whey is converted from a dairy byproduct to a useful prebiotic using enzymes immobilized on cotton cloth. Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) are a collection of prebiotic fibers made of a chain of galactose sugars of variable length. GOS has been shown to exert some of the most potent and beneficial effects among prebiotic fibers. When added to infant formula, it can change bowel flora to approximate the bowel flora composition of breast fed infants. It can also reduce markers of inflammation, mitigate adverse effects of antibiotics, and promote a healthy population of bifidobacteria in all ages. Enzymes are often used in soluble form to create bioproducts, but that method has its disadvantages, including inability to control product formation or to operate continuously, and its inefficiency. Biocatalyst immobilization, though, is gaining increased attention for the synthesis of industrial bioproducts ranging from neutraceuticals to chemicals. A low-cost way to produce GOS is needed. Researchers at The Ohio State University led by Dr. Shang-Tian Yang have developed a process to produce galacto-oligosaccharides from lactose by enzyme immobilized on cotton cloth. Polyethlyeneimine is used to coat the cloth and support the enzymes. Lactose, which is otherwise not a marketable product, can be converted into GOS, which is highly desirable in the food industry for its health benefits. Commercial Applications: Food and Nutrition, Additives, Prebiotics.

Venous access ports are central venous access devices that allow healthcare practitioners easy access to the patient\u2019s veins to give treatment and take blood. Typically, these ports are made of non-irritant material and can remain under the skin for weeks or months.\n\nThe Need\nAccessing a patient\u2019s port is a sterile procedure requiring several steps. As these steps are conducted by a human, there is room for user error, which can increase the possibility of contamination or infection.

    "ip_description": "The current manufacturing methods for Lithium-Ion Batteries are limited to around 200 Wh/kg. Power density is a factor of the battery construction and is highly dependent on the electrodes. Conventional Li-ion batteries consist of electrodes constructed of stacks of 70 \u00b5m films. The thin electrodes then require current collectors and separators for assembly, which increase mass without adding charge capacity. The need for these inactive components limits the power density of batteries as they add no storage capacity. Standard electrode film thickness is limited to around 100 \u00b5m because as thickness increases, the potential for ion transport across the electrode is reduced. Reduced ion transfer results in reduced power storage capacity and will also result in poor cycling characteristics over the life of the battery. This technology describes a manufacturing method for producing thick electrodes for Li-ion batteries by controlling porosity during construction. This is done by engineering cracks through the thickness of the electrode during manufacturing to allow for increased ion transport or charge capacity. The result is high energy capacity without the drawback of poor cycling characteristics. The inventor has demonstrated the ability to optimize the amount of cracking during production to limit power storage capacity reduction in typically seen in thicker electrodes. This manufacturing technique could produce thick electrodes with high stability resulting in Lithium-Ion batteries with improved power density over thin film electrodes. It has extensive application in electric vehicles and grid connected energy storage systems. The technology produces thick electrodes, which can result in Li-ion batteries with power densities more than 300 Wh/kg.

    "ip_description": "The Need: Food coloring is an important factor of the consumer's perception of the quality and flavor of a food product, boosting the product's overall success. Not only does it provide a different color to food products, it even helps prevent color loss during long-term storage. However, in recent years, the demand for natural food coloring is growing because consumers are concerned about synthetic dyes and the impact on their health. The natural food colors market is expected to be worth $3.2 billion by 2027. and there is ongoing reseach in the industry for brilliant food dyes that are natural with a focus on colors such as cyan blue. Developing a blue nature colorant is somewhat difficult given the rarity of this color in nature but resechers at OSU have developed an editable vibrant and stable anthocyanin-based blue colorant for use in acidic environments.\n\nThe Technology: Researchers at the Ohio State University, led by Dr. Monica Giusti, have developed an editable vibrant and stable anthocyanin-based blue colorant for use in acidic environments. The statrting materials needed to form this anthocyanin complex were isolated from American eggplant peel and Yerba Mate. Blue complexes were formed by mixing different ratios of eggplant extract and Yerba Mate extract. Complexes were successfully produced at pH 4, and the blue hue remained even when the pH was decreased to 2.90. The _\u03bb__max_ (586-580 nm) and hue angle (264\u2013266\u00b0) did not significantly change when the pH decreased from 4.09 to 3.33. At pH 3.10-2.90, the hue turned to purplish blue (h = 273\u00b0 to 284\u00b0). At lower pH the blue color was lost. The colors remained remarkably stable over 2-month storage at 4\u2103, with no significant change in the _\u03bb__max_ and > 75% blue color retention.\n\nBenefits/Advantages: This work performed by the Giusti lab has produced a new potential blue colorant for the food industry using readily available edible materials to create a natural Blue-Complex colorant. The blue complex was formed by using eggplant extract and Yerba Mate and express blue color at pH as low as 2.90 for 2 months refrigerated storage, providing a new natural blue food colorant for the food industry.",

    "ip_description": "A parenteral administration of a naturally occurring chemical used to treat influenza-induced hypoxemia, lung dysfunction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This treatment could also be potentially useful in treating ARDS from other causes. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by impaired alveolar gas exchange, a symptom that leads to a lack of oxygen in the bloodstream. This lack of oxygen to vital organs can lead to organ failure and results in a high possibility of patient death. The influenza virus has the potential to cause this respiratory distress due to the method through which the virus attacks the alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs. The damage to these cells in influenza patients is often accompanied by problems in pulmonary surfactant, a fluid that is essential to normal lung function. Direct administration of artificial surfactant (e.g., Survanta) into the lungs is highly effective in treating neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, but recent trials of surfactant replacement therapy in ARDS patients were inconclusive or showed no benefit. Therefore, it is necessary to find a technique that improves synthesis of healthy surfactant in order to promote improved lung function and boost influenza survival rates. There is currently no specific therapy for ARDS; most patients are just treated in the ICU with noninvasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation, and conservative fluid management. There is a great need for new treatments that can prevent, retard, or manage progression of severe influenza to ARDS. Ohio State University researchers led by Dr. Ian Davis have developed a therapeutic that successfully aids in the development of pulmonary surfactant. By parenterally administering a dose of an already-used and regulated nutritional supplement, it could be possible to bypass the block that ARDS patients experience in producing healthy lung fluid. This therapy would enhance the production of precursors that are necessary for the generation of said lung fluid, thereby promoting improved lung function and increasing influenza survival rates. Because similar symptoms have been described for ARDS caused by other afflictions, this therapy could have more general application, as well. Preliminary data using a well-established mouse model of influenza-induced ARDS indicates that this treatment reduces post-infection weight loss, hypoxemia, bradycardia, pulmonary edema, and decreases static lung compliance, all of which indicate ARDS attenuation. Commercial Applications: Pharmaceuticals, Influenza treatment, Respiratory/ Pulmonary Therapies. Benefits/ Advantages: Water-soluble (simple to administer parenterally), Known to be safe in patients, as it is marketed as a nutritional supplement, Anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, Stimulates ventilation, Avoids issues associated with intrapulmonary drug administration.",

Lymphoma is the most common life-threatening cancer of dogs, accounting for up to 24% of all malignancies and over 80% of all hematopoietic cancers. Spontaneously occurring lymphoma in the dog has many of the same histopathological, molecular, and clinical features as non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) in people as well. Likewise, spontaneous lymphoma in the dog has a similar clinical presentation, response to chemotherapy, and clinical progression compared to NHL in people. Given these similarities and the advantage of larger subject size and presence of spontaneous disease (in contrast to small subject size and experimentally induced disease in rodents); spontaneously occurring lymphoma in the dog represents an excellent large animal model for the study of lymphoma in people, including investigation of new therapeutic agents. Few canine leukemia/lymphoma cell lines have been established, and most existing cell lines are derived from leukemias rather than lymphomas, or have an otherwise uncertain origin. Furthermore, most of these other cell lines are insufficiently characterized and often are not available to the general scientific community for use for a variety of reasons. The Ohio State University researchers, led by Dr. William Kisseberth, have developed a canine lymphoma cell line established from the malignant pleural effusion of a dog with peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The cell line is the best characterized as established canine lymphoma cell line and contains several of the common chromosomal aberrations found in canine lymphoma.

    "ip_description": "The cardiac ryanodine receptor channel 2 (RyR2) is known as the Ca2+ release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and is believed to be a good therapeutic target in a group of certain heart diseases, known as cardiac ryanopathies. A number of mutations in the RyR2 gene have been linked to a wide spectrum of arrhythmic heart disease. Impaired RyR2 leads to heart diseases such as congestive heart failure (CHF), catecholeaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 (ARVD2), and Ca2+ release deficiency syndrome. Addressing dysregulated Ca2+ release offers an effective therapy for cardiac ryanopathies.\n\n**The Unmet Need**\nFirst line therapy for CPVT is beta-blockers. If beta-blocker therapy is ineffective, flecainide, a Na+ channel inhibitor that may also inhibit RyR2 Ca2+ release, may be added. Other currently available therapies, such as dantrolene, a water-insoluble small molecule hydantoin derivative, and mavacamten, a small molecule inhibitor of the cardiac myosin ATPase, have side-effects due to the off-target and non-specific effects of the drugs. Therapies that prevent the functional remodeling of RyR2 are believed to be promising new strategies for addressing Ca2+-dependent processes governed by diastolic SR Ca2+ leak. Currently, there are not any clinically available RyR2-specific inhibitors addressing dysregulated Ca2+ release.\n\n**The Technology**\nResearchers at The Ohio State University have developed novel chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) polypeptides and polynucleotides encoding the CLIC polypeptides useful for treating a cardiovascular disorder, a neurological disorder, or a reproductive disorder in a patient having one or more mutations at a RYR2 gene (ryanopathies) or having a ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2)-associated disorder. The CLIC proteins (CLIC1-CLIC6) regulate diverse physiological functions and have been implicated in human diseases. CLIC4 is a mitochondrial-associated membrane Cl- channel that modulates Ca2+ homeostasis and affects endoplasmic reticulum/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR)-mitochondrial Ca2+ transfer.

    "ip_description": "Using tissue nano-transfection to regulate BAT and increase 12,13-diHOME production to treat obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death across the US and worldwide and affects almost half of all adults in the US. CVD encompasses a number of conditions that affect the heart and vasculature. CVD can arise in response to multiple factors, including obesity. Obesity elevates the risk of CVD by increasing the development and severity of comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Exercise has been an important tool in combating CVD, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) releases the lipokine 12,13-diHOME in response to cold and exercise, which acts in an autocrine and endocrine manner to increase fatty acid uptake into both BAT and skeletal muscle, reducing circulating triglycerides and decreasing adiposity and insulin resistance, and also has a direct effect to improve cardiac function. Patients suffering obesity or CVD are often told to build healthier habits such as getting more physical activity and eating a heart-healthy diet. However, many such patients suffer comorbidities that prevent them from participating in physical activity. One mechanism for exercise to combat obesity and CVD is via the release of the lipokine 12,13-diHOME. No current obesity or CVD treatment mimics the positive effects of exercise on the heart. Compositions and methods for treating CVD, obesity and type 2 diabetes through the regulation of BAT are needed. Researchers at The Ohio State University have developed a method for treating obesity and CVD by increasing levels of lipokines, in particular 12,13-diHOME, through manipulation of the skin. Sustained upregulation of 12,13-diHOME by tissue nanotransfection (TNT) negated the adverse effects of a high-fat diet on body weight, adiposity, cardiac function and cardiac remodeling in mice. The novel method is especially useful for treating obesity, and CVD related to obesity, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, stroke, atherosclerosis, heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias.

    "ip_description": "Novel, transition metal-free catalysts capable of alkyne hydrogenation and semihydrogenation under modest conditions. Numerous industrial processes require alkyne semihydrogenation or hydrogenation reactions. For example, hydrogenation is necessary for the industrial-scale synthesis vitamin A, the creation of high molecular weight polymers, and the processing of petroleum into functionally useful derivatives. Catalysts are typically employed to facilitate these reactions. However, existing catalysts suffer from several shortcomings: they are composed of expensive transition metals and require substantial energy input (in the form of high temperatures, pressures, or electrical overpotentials) to run. For example, the current industry standard catalyst for alkyne semihydrogenation requires palladium, which is one of the rarest and most expensive naturally occurring elements. Thus, there is a need for catalysts that utilize less energy and that are composed of less expensive, earth-abundant elements. Researchers at The Ohio State University led by Dr. Joshua Goldberger have discovered a new family of Zintl phase, transition-metal free catalysts. Specifically, Dr. Goldberger and his team have developed a CaGaGe catalyst capable of alkyne hydrogenation and semihydrogenation at efficiencies rivaling that of commercial palladium-based catalysts. The researchers have demonstrated that this catalyst mediates hydrogenation of the alkyne-containing phenylacetylene into styrene and ethylbenzene (important industrial chemicals) even under modest pressure and temperature conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst has been shown to retain its activity even after multiple cycles. This family of catalysts promises to greatly reduce the financial and energy costs currently incurred during hydrogenation and semihydrogenation reactions, potentially impacting multiple industries. Competitive Advantages: Cheaper to produce catalyst itself, Less energy required to run hydrogenation reaction.

    "ip_description": "The novel approach developed by OSU researchers in this invention involves synthesis of precursors such as Lewis acid zeolite tin (Sn)-beta utilizing alkyl Sn compounds. The approach developed demonstrates that alkyl Sn precursors can effect catalytic site structures and help produce more open sites than currently used compounds. Experiments conducted demonstrate that combinations such as Me-Sn-Cl3 produced the most active catalyst for alcohol ring-opening (ARO) when tested with epichlorohydrin and methanol; while Ph-Sn-Cl3 is more active than Me-Sn-Cl3 for ARO when using 1, 2-epoxyhexane and methanol. In this manner, different alkylated Sn precursors characterized by the inventors enable optimal compound configurations for use in different chemical processes and improve efficiencies. Chemical processes, such as Baeyer\u2013Villiger oxidation reaction and related biomass conversions, benefit from using the compounds developed in this approach, like Lewis acid zeolite Sn-beta compounds of the type. Other applications using catalytic materials for isomerizing glucose into fructose in an aqueous medium would find this approach of value in enhancing process performance. Synthesis of materials requiring enhanced quantity and development of open/new sites during the catalytic process can achieve these goals efficiently in terms of time and cost by using the alkyl tin precursor compounds developed and characterized in this approach.

    "ip_description": "Swine influenza is an acute respiratory disease of pigs caused by swine influenza A virus (SwIAV). Pigs are naturally vulnerable to SwIAV-associated with secondary bacterial infections and is an economic threat to the global pig industry. Commonly circulating SwIAV strains in swine population are H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. In the United States, periodically human infections are occurred from some of the SwIAVs. In last two decades, triple reassortant SwIAVs have been isolated from pigs and its association with human infections have been well documented. Therefore, vaccination of pigs is a common practice to reduce the influenza burden in swine industry and to avoid the risk of zoonotic transmission to humans. The SwIAV vaccine inoculated into sows protects the herd from infection and heightens the transfer of maternally-derived antibodies (MDA) to offspring through colostrum. However, a number of studies have revealed that MDA offered various levels of protection against SwIAV infection in piglets. In weaned piglets, MDA interferes with parenteral administered killed/inactivated influenza virus vaccines, resulting in poor induction of antibody responses and documented evidence of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease underscoring the need for an improved vaccine approach.\n\nResearches at OSU have developed a mannose conjugated chitosan (mCS) nanoparticle comprising killed antigen (KAg) to target dendritic cells and macrophages which express mannose receptors. In maternal derived antibody (MDA)-positive piglets, prime-boost intranasal inoculation of mCS NPs-KAg vaccine elicited enhanced homologous (H1N2-OH10), heterologous (H1N1-OH7), and heterosubtypic (H3N2-OH4) influenza virus-specific secretory IgA (sIgA) antibody response in nasal passage compared to CS NPs-KAg vaccinates. Upon challenge with a heterologous SwIAV H1N1, the mCS NPs-KAg vaccines augmented H1N2-OH10, H1N1-OH7, and H3N2-OH4 virus-specific sIgA antibody responses in nasal swab, lung lysate, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid; and IgG antibody levels in lung lysate and BAL fluid. samples. In the mCS NPs-KAg vaccinates increased H1N2-OH10 but not H1N1-OH7 and H3N2- OH4-specific serum hemagglutination inhibition titers were observed.\n\nAdditionally, mCS NPs-KAg vaccine increased specific recall lymphocyte proliferation and cytokines IL-4, IL-10, and IFN\u03b3 gene expression compared to CS NPs-KAg and commercial SwIAV vaccinates in tracheobronchial lymph nodes. The mCS NPs-KAg vaccinates cleared the challenge H1N1-OH7 virus load in upper and lower respiratory tract more efficiently when compared to commercial vaccine. The virus clearance was associated with reduced gross lung lesions. Overall, mCS NP-KAg vaccine intranasal immunization in MDA-positive pigs induced a robust cross-reactive immunity and offered protection against influenza virus.",

Individuals contract the disease by consuming food or water contaminated with the etiologic agent _S._ Typhi. Typhoid fever is characterized by high fever, abdominal pain, bacteremia, headache, diarrhea, and malaise.\n\n**The Need**\n_S._ Typhi will persist in the gallbladder of 3-5% of individuals, after resolution of the acute infection, through an asymptomatic chronic carrier state, during which fecal shedding allows the bacteria to spread. Patients remain unknowingly infectious, a particularly dangerous cycle in areas without developed sewage treatment and sanitation procedures. In this chronic carrier state, _S._ Typhi forms biofilms \u2013 organized, multicellular communities encapsulated in an extracellular matrix of polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA \u2013 on gallstones. The biofilm extracellular matrix protects the bacteria from antibiotics, host immune responses, and other environmental threats. As such, compounds that are effective against biofilms are critical for resolving these issues.\n\n**The Technology**\nThis technology describes a compound, M4, that was found to display significant biofilm dispersal and inhibition of biofilm formation in _S._ Typhi. M4 was initially identified among a group of 8 compounds that were found to display similar, albeit less strong, activity. M4 shows promising activity with inhibition of biofilm formation (EC50 of 8 \u00b5M) and biofilm dispersion (EC50 of 20 \u00b5M). M4 has shown efficacy in a mouse model of chronic typhoid fever.

Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Paul Stoodley and Dr. Rafael Bruschweiler, have identified specific metabolites and unique metabolite signatures produced by bacteria grown as biofilms using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics. Specifically, they have found metabolite differences among two common pathogens, P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, in bovine synovial fluid as well as human joint fluid. These findings show the potential of NMR-based metabolomics as a tool for diagnosis and identification of new targets for prevention and control of biofilm-related joint infections. The identification of metabolic differences between P. aeruginosa planktonic and biofilm phenotypes led to the discovery that the cadaverine branch of the lysine degradation pathway is linked to the establishment of the growth mode in P. aeruginosa. Moreover, cadaverine is a potential target for prevention and mitigation of P. aeruginosa biofilm infections.

    "ip_description": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNs) usable for the delivery of therapeutic compositions, including, but not limited to nucleic acids (NAs). Nucleic Acid (NA) based therapies are used to inhibit gene expression. Lipid nanoparticles (LNs) are capable of carrying these therapies into cells. However, this delivery requires overcoming several physiological barriers. For instance, one barrier is the acidic endosome conditions within the cell. LNs must release the drug into the cytoplasm before the conditions degrade the drug. In addition, NAs have high negative charges that hinder their passage across the cell membrane. Therefore, there is a need for efficient delivery methods that protect and transport the therapies effectively. New LNs are further needed to transverse the capillary endothelium, reach target cells without causing excessive immunoactivation or off target cytotoxicity, promote endocytosis, and form stable formulations with long shelf-lives in order to promote this efficiency. Ohio State Inventors, led by Dr. Robert J. Lee, developed a LN compositions that overcome the barriers that traditional therapeutic and NA-based therapies face. The LNs comprise a mixture of lipids, along with PEGylating lipid and/or cholesterol, which improves transfection activity and reduces cytotoxicity. The LNs are also stable under refrigeration for several months. The compositions also include positively charged quaternary or tertiary amines-based cationic lipids to combat endosomal escape of the therapies. Commercial Applications: Pharmaceutical Drug Therapy, Pathology Research, Medical Laboratories. Benefits/Advantages: Efficient delivery of therapies, Long shelf life, Stable formulations.

The Need: Transportation infrastructure depends on a robust and well-maintained system of bridges. In the U.S., federal law requires that bridges be inspected once every two years. Some states, including Ohio, require bridges to be inspected every year. One problem with these inspections is that for several decades, various bridge performance metrics have been developed and used to inform on the states of bridges, and these metrics have had shortcomings. These metrics use subjective weight factors to account for consequences, neglect major safety- and serviceability-related consequences, or do not effectively utilize available data on bridges.

For example, waste produced by water treatment facilities serves as fertilizer for agricultural land, and if not properly treated, toxic cyanobacteria can grow in the soil followed by uptake into plants. Because of this, it is crucial to treat wastewater properly. Wastewater needs three subsequent treatments before water reuse, recycling, or release back into the environment. The tertiary treatment involves removing microorganisms from the water, as certain ones are pathogenic for humans. Typically, chlorination is this tertiary step, but this method is inherently hazardous and can create toxic by-products. Instead, UV disinfection is becoming more common for treating wastewater, as it does not produce harmful byproducts or hazardous material concerns. Current UV treatment systems may need retrofitting to an existing wastewater treatment plant or building a completely new system, and both processes can be costly.\n\n**The Technology**\nEnvironmental scientists at The Ohio State University have developed a USV equipped with UV-C lights that acts as an on-site treatment for toxic cyanobacteria blooms. Since the cyanobacteria blooms rise to the water surface, having a USV running along the surface can treat the cyanobacteria where they naturally accumulate. The device is cost effective, as once built it requires no input costs. Cyanobacterial blooms increased drinking water treatment costs by ~$13 million in Ohio alone in 2011\u20132012. With the blooms under control, the proposed technology could help reduce water treatment costs. This device has the potential to become a new standard in water management practices, because it can increase sustainability, create safe use of sludge for the agricultural industry, and protect the ecosystem and public health.\n\n**Commercial Applications**\n*   Elimination of toxins from wastewater recycled for human consumption and other uses\n*   Wastewater treatment to eliminate toxins from sludge used to fertilize crops\n*   Sterilization of pool water\n\n**Benefits/Advantages**\n*   Environmentally friendly and sustainable (not chemical based)\n*   Cost effective with the potential to reduce water treatment costs\n*   Easily transported\n*   Treats contaminants at the source and improves water quality\n*   Prevents plants in the agriculture industry from taking up these toxins\n*   Includes features to help with battery life",

    "ip_description": "A novel, low-cost, and massively-parallel force spectroscopy strategy that leverages microfluidic technology to dynamically test strength of molecular binding interactions to enable quick, full characterization of a molecular interaction of interest. Development of several force spectroscopy strategies have enabled characterization of various types of molecular binding interactions with applications in biophysics, molecular biology and medicine. Despite various efforts to decrease the cost of force spectroscopy, full characterization of a molecular interaction of interest remains cost prohibitive for most laboratories. In addition, there is significant need for quick characterization of a molecular interaction of interest that does not require lengthy periods of sample preparation and analysis. Microfluidics technology along with the use of fluid flow to controllably apply force on molecular levels can help address the mentioned needs to reduce the total cost and experimental time of molecular force spectroscopy. A recent collaborative research effort between the Nanoengineering and Biodesign Laboratory led by Dr. Carlos Castro and Microsystems for Mechanobiology and Medicine Laboratory led by Dr. Jonathan Song at department of mechanical engineering at the Ohio State University has resulted in the development of a novel, low-cost and massively parallel force spectroscopy technology that enables quick, full characterization of a molecular interaction of interest. This method leverages a microfluidic loading on a chip (FLOChip) that allows for controlled, simultaneous application of four levels of molecular forces on up to ~4000 interaction of interest, enabling its complete dynamic characterization. Moreover, utilization of fluid flow and PDMS-based microfluidics results in ~3-fold decrease in total experimental cost compared to alternative force spectroscopy strategies with similar levels of throughput. In addition, the ability to apply multiple levels of molecular force simultaneously results in significantly faster total time of experimentation and analysis in comparison to alternative strategies available. Using FLOChip, the researchers have demonstrated successful full characterization of several molecular binding interactions, including double stranded DNA and antibody-antigen binding strength. Commercial Applications: Single molecule analysis, Force spectroscopy, Molecular biochemistry and biophysics, Aptamer development and optimization, Medicine, Diagnostics. Benefits/Advantages: Lowered total cost, Simplified experimentation, Fast preparation and analysis, Multiplexed force application, High sensitivity.",

    "ip_number": "T2021-108",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "CRISPR/Cas 9 mediated targeting of MIR155HG in primary human T cells creates genomic deletions that disrupt transcription of mature microRNA-155 (miR-155, a miR associated with inflammation). Applying this treatment to donor T cells prior to allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) when treating hematological malignancies and other primary bone marrow disorders can prevent the development of aGVHD in patients.\n\n**The Need**\nMore than 8,000 patients receive allo-HSCT annually in the US alone as a cure for hematologic malignancies and other primary bone marrow disorders. However, the major barrier for the success of allo-HSCT is the high incidence of aGVHD and its associated morbidity and mortality. Acute GVHD is clinically characterized by damage to the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Current preventive measures of aGVHD involve pharmacological immunosuppression or T cell depletion, but despite the use of standard GVHD prophylaxis regimens, 30-75% of patients who receive allo-HSCT eventually develop aGVHD. Despite response rates of only 40-60%, the standard first-line treatment for GVHD remains high-dose corticosteroids, which results in high rates of non-relapse mortality. Finding a novel therapeutic that could prevent the development of aGVHD would be a turning point in the global HSCT market, which is estimated to be US $2 billion in 2020 and is expected to have a CAGR of 11% 2020-2027 due to the growth in leukemia and lymphoma cases.\n\n**The Technology**\nResearchers at the Ohio State University, led by Dr. Parvathi Ranganathan, have developed a strategy to genomically target MIR155HG using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, thereby reducing the expression of microRNA-155, which is associated with the development of aGVHD. By designing pairs of sgRNA to target certain fragments of MIR155HG, they were able to decrease, and in some cases prevent, the development of GVHD in a xenogeneic model of the disease. The research initially focused on using the sgRNA to target either the promoter or exon 3 sequences of MIR155HG. CRISPR-edited T cells were injected into NSG mice and evaluated for protection against development of GVHD in a xenogeneic model of aGVHD. Data were recorded for non-targeting, exon 3-targeting, and promoter-targeting groups. In **Figure 1**, fold change in miR-155 and MIR155HG expression were measured at 72 hours (**C**) and 7 days (**D**) post-transfection, showing promising results, esp. for the exon 3-targeting group. In **Figure 2**, the probability of survival (**A**) and aGVHD clinical scores (**B**) were compared with the non-targeting and the exon 3-targeting T cell transplants. Again the results support MIR155HG exon 3-targeting, which showed survival for the transplant group of >100 days post-transplant, and an aGVHD clinical score of 0 up to about 60 days and up to ~2 at 100 days post-transplant (compared to ~4 at 65 days post-transplant for the non-targeting group). Results indicate CRISPR/Cas9 mediated targeting of MIR155HG results in sustained downregulation of miR-155 expression in primary human T cells, no production in significant off-target effects, and protection form aGVHD in a xenogeneic model of the disease. Additionally, T cells lacking miR-155 show robust anti-tumor clearance comparable to WT T cells. These results showcase the power of genomic deletion in MIR155HG and subsequent prevention of aGVHD in mice models, with promising translation to human models. Using this strategy to engineer human donor T cells in patients undergoing allo-HSCT could be a better preventative measure against aGVHD when compared to the alternatives.\n\n**Commercial Applications**\n*   aGVHD prevention in patients undergoing allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n*   Hematologic cancer treatment\n*   Increased scope for allo-HSCT therapy, including for bone marrow failures (for which currently GVHD is a major impediment).\n*   Stem cell research and therapy\n*   CRISPR research and development\n\n**Benefits/Advantages**\n*   Xenogeneic model proved treatment to be effective against aGVHD\n*   Maintains Graft versus leukemia effect, important for preventing relapse\n*   Increase survivability for patients with hematologic malignancies.\n*   Safer preventative treatment when compared to alternatives\n*   Non-invasive treatment",

Studies show that 15-30% of melanomas are Nras driven and 60% of melanomas are Braf driven. Dr. Christin Burd's lab at The Ohio State University has developed a set of Nras-mutant mouse melanoma cell lines that complement a set of Braf cell lines developed by Marcus Bosenberg at Yale University. Recent progress and successful application of immune-based therapies in cancer has increased the desire for immune-competent models to evaluate pre-clinical therapies. Immunocompetent genetically-engineered mouse models harboring discrete genetic drivers of melanoma are essential for studying potential immunotherapies, but are limited by the need to maintain colonies of multiple genotypes necessary to generate animals with the appropriate genetic backgrounds. Tumor cell lines derived from inbred or congenic mice have been utilized for the study of tumor immune responses. The lines are easy to use, reproducible and experimental results can be readily attained. However, for many cancer types, the number of available cell lines for study is limited, the genetic drivers in the cells are often unclear and tumor growth characteristics are not ideal. Furthermore, mutational profiles among these tumors can be very different from their human counterparts. These considerations limit the utility and predictive value of using these models in isolation. The series of Nras mouse melanoma cell lines will help address many of these prior limitations. Fifteen Nras mouse melanoma cell lines have been developed. They were isolated from spontaneously arising melanomas in C57Bl/6 mice treated with ultraviolet B irradiation. Melanocytes in the donor animals all carry either an Nras61R mutation (TpN61R.62, TN61R.3, N61R.2-1, TN61R.9, TN61R.5, TN61R.14, TN61R.7, TN61R.4, TN61R1.1, TpN.62), an Nras61L mutation (TN61L.238), an Nras61K mutation (TN61K.242, TN61K.239.1, TN61K.239.2) or an Nras13R mutation (TN13R.283, TN13R.239). The TpN.62 cell line is also albino and null for p16INK4a. Genotyping was performed to confirm that the cell lines contain the indicated Nras gene alteration. Whole exome sequencing was used to characterize other mutations arising as a result of tumorigenesis and/or UV irradiation.

    "ip_description": "The 'Louie' method for wayfinding offers opportunities for integration with maps, area/building representations, and floor plans with known triggers built-in to help users on the Autism Spectrum prepare for their journey remotely before their trip and avoid troublesome triggers in real-time. For instance, a large hospital employing 'Louie' software would offer an augmented reality journey through the halls and help patients be on notice of potential triggers before they arrive. On a bus, the software would tell a user when to get off, when to expect flashing lights, and warn of loud or obnoxious sounds along the route. For pedestrians, sidewalk sizes, buildings, sounds, and crowd sizes would all be available and users could detour around or be prepared for these triggers. 'Louie' is a customizable, augmented reality navigation system. Upon starting up, the software prompts users to select general sensors that trigger negative responses for them in order to tailor the app for their specific needs. A user may not be especially sensitive to crowds, for example, so they would disable the 'crowd' trigger. That same user wants to avoid flickering bright lights and enables 'sight' triggers. Along the journey, users acknowledge existing triggers and also populate triggers they discover that do not yet appear in 'Louie'. Crowd sourcing the data allows for faster updates in real-time and improves veracity of the information. 'Louie' is accessed through mobile devices and as plugins for existing map technologies. There is strong potential for use of 'Louie' in new VR technology as well. Bluetooth noise canceling headphones can integrate with the app to help control auditory over-stimulation. Headphones also allow an opportunity for spoken step-by-step instructions from 'Louie's' digital platform. Wearables such as the Apple Watch can enhance the experience by extending alerts from visual and auditory to physical vibration capabilities.

The app not only tracks the efficacy of each patient's treatment, it can provide additional information to supplement and support the needs of the clinical trial.\n\nThe Need\n\nThe recent opioid epidemic has devastated American cities and kills 91 Americans per day. 80% of these addicts start with prescription pain killers. Preventative strategies to lower opioid use must be developed as most state adopted regulatory measures have failed. The development of such preventative strategies requires clinical trials studying the effects of alternate pain management techniques. In the current standard of care for managing acute pain after surgery, prescription pain killers are routinely prescribed and an inappropriate use of prescription pain killers may lead to many patients unwillingly becoming addicted to narcotics and dying from overdose. The use of a non-narcotic regimen paired with an app to establish a method for providers to track patient pain, along with post-operative pain medications, may indicate that non-narcotic regimens provide comparable pain control as narcotics, without the risk of addiction. Thus, clinical trials such as this provide researchers and medical providers a way to track and analyze patients as they progress through the course of their entire treatment, from pre-operation to post-operation. Ultimately, this has potential to provide a new safer patient standard of care to manage pain after surgery, close the narcotic gateway, and make a major preventative impact on the current opioid epidemic.\n\nThe Technology\n\nTo fill this void in the data, Ohio State University researchers Rajiv Chandawarkar and Allison Capek have created a mobile application that connects patients, providers and researchers to each other, while providing a system for quick and easy data collection from the patient. The app would not only help the patient through their pain-management therapy by providing them with helpful reminders to take their medications and information for non-prescriptive alternative pain-management options, but it would also allow providers to track each patients and the efficiency of their treatments. That same data would also be shared directly with researchers for analysis.\n\nBy bringing the three parties together, providers are able to better understand the needs of their patients using the app and the data they have collected, while patients are able to stay better informed of their treatment and quickly report problems and issues directly to their provider. Though focused on pain-management, the app could be expanded for use in various medical settings where providers/researchers would like to track and analyze other therapies or other conditions.\n\nCommercial Applications\n\n*   Pain-management care\n*   Prescription abuse prevention\n*   Patient monitoring\n\nBenefits/Advantages\n\n*   Direct communication between patients and providers\n*   Remote patient tracking\n*   Direct data transfer for researchers during clinical studies",

    "ip_description": "An extensive collection of inexpensive, well-balanced meals with an accompanying series of lessons packed with fun activities to advance nutritional knowledge and family engagement. The Need: Food insecurity within a household is directly associated with a family\u2019s lack of available resources. Low-income families can often find it difficult to provide enough food, which can cause a reduction in food consumption, disruptive eating patterns, or other unhealthy eating habits. When families experience food insecurity, it is common for the foods being consumed to consist mostly of grains and other filling items that may not provide essential nutrients. Low-income families have also become more inclined to consume cheap fast food options in an effort to save time and money. Time and budget constraints, limited nutrition knowledge and preparation skills, and lack of social support can often inhibit parents from providing regular family meals and healthy mealtime routines, causing families to resort to quick, cheap meals. Food behaviors such as these can have adverse health effects \u2013 both physically and mentally \u2013 especially for developing children and adolescents. Eating behaviors that cause obesity are established early in life and become difficult to change later. Childhood obesity has become prevalent in the US and obesity can lead to much more serious conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. A lack of healthy food also causes children to become disassociated from key learning opportunities related to nutrition and beneficial family interaction. In order to improve the health of children and adolescents and better prepare them for a healthful adulthood, a program that utilizes balanced meals with ingredients that are easily attainable by limited-resource families and that encourages children to be involved has been developed. The Technology: Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Carolyn Gunther, developed Simple Suppers, a nutrition education/cooking curriculum of ten different lessons designed to encourage limited-resource families to establish healthy eating behaviors. Simple Suppers consists of lessons plan aimed at exploring the benefits and constraints of healthy home-cooking for families with limited resources and is accompanied with a collection of recipes. Unlike traditional cookbooks, the recipes were created with inexpensive, easily-accessible ingredients that can provide a well-balanced meal for the family. These recipes can provide families with a meal option that provides children and adolescents with the necessary nutrients for growth as well as opportunities to learn about and be involved with meal preparation. The lessons covered in the program teach families how to manage their resources when planning and preparing meals using budgets and time-saving strategies, how to compare various food options and sizes for meals, and how to get everyone involved in establishing a healthy diet. Simple Suppers is evidence-based and has been field-tested with preliminary data indicating increased frequency of family meals and improvements in certain child dietary behaviors. Commercial Applications: * Nutritional classes for students in schools * Community learning classes for families * Training for new families or those looking to improve health Benefits/Advantages: * Easy to understand curriculum * Designed specifically for young children * Use in field tests increased family meals and improve child dietary outcomes",

An alternative to the mind-numbing calculus which arises from traditional methods is needed. Dr. David Melamed has developed an algorithm to meet this issue. The algorithm essentially reduces the pool of cases when looking for a rare event. The algorithm uses configurational methods to identify the conditions, or combinations of conditions, that lead to the non-occurrence of rare events. By excluding cases of non-occurrence, the baseline likelihood of occurrence increases. Preliminary analyses (ground truth and simulations) are quite promising. In one set of simulations, it was possible to reduce the pool of possible cases by 60%. Commercial Applications: Business/Finance, Economics, Research.

    "ip_description": "Novel, transition metal-free catalysts capable of alkyne hydrogenation and semihydrogenation under modest conditions. Numerous industrial processes require alkyne semihydrogenation or hydrogenation reactions. For example, hydrogenation is necessary for the industrial-scale synthesis vitamin A, the creation of high molecular weight polymers, and the processing of petroleum into functionally useful derivatives. Catalysts are typically employed to facilitate these reactions. However, existing catalysts suffer from several shortcomings: they are composed of expensive transition metals and require substantial energy input (in the form of high temperatures, pressures, or electrical overpotentials) to run. For example, the current industry standard catalyst for alkyne semihydrogenation requires palladium, which is one of the rarest and most expensive naturally occurring elements. Thus, there is a need for catalysts that utilize less energy and that are composed of less expensive, earth-abundant elements. Researchers at The Ohio State University led by Dr. Joshua Goldberger have discovered a new family of Zintl phase, transition-metal free catalysts. Specifically, Dr. Goldberger and his team have developed a BaGa2 catalyst capable of alkyne hydrogenation and semihydrogenation at efficiencies rivaling that of commercial palladium-based catalysts. The researchers have demonstrated that this catalyst mediates hydrogenation of the alkyne-containing phenylacetylene into styrene and ethylbenzene (important industrial chemicals) even under modest pressure and temperature conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst has been shown to retain its activity even after multiple cycles. This family of catalysts promises to greatly reduce the financial and energy costs currently incurred during hydrogenation and semihydrogenation reactions, potentially impacting multiple industries. Competitive Advantages: Cheaper to produce catalyst itself, Less energy required to run hydrogenation reaction.

    "ip_description": "A rabbit model has been created for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) that more closely resembles the effects experienced in humans while being more cost effective compared to larger animal models. DMD is a lethal genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness and muscle wasting. There are several animal models for DMD, including mice, dog and pig. The most widely used mouse model of DMD is mdx mice, which show typical features of muscular dystrophy, however, they do not fully recapitulate human DMD pathology. For example, human DMD patients develop cardiomyopathy and many die from cardiac failure, but the mdx mice for the most part, live a normal lifespan and do not present cardiac dysfunction until a year later. The large animal models such as dog and pig are better in phenotype presentation but the high cost associated with using them (such as longer gestational periods and higher colony maintenance costs) make it hard on researchers. Therefore, an attempt to generate a new animal model of DMD using rabbits was made. The DMD-KO rabbits were generated by microinjection of CBE mRNA and sgRNA targeting exon 51 of the DMD gene into rabbit zygotes. The founder rabbits were genotyped by direct DNA sequencing. They showed reduced body weight, increased premature death, reduced physical activity, increased serum creatine kinase levels, and decreased ejection fraction. Many of these pathological features are also seen in human counterparts, making it a useful model to study the disease mechanisms, biomarkers and preclinical therapeutic testing. This model addresses the concerns of the larger animal model by being cost effective and having a low gestation period, and it addresses the smaller animal model concerns by having a more similar pathology to humans.",

    "ip_description": "A novel monoclonal antibody (PIIO-1) to be used in combination with immune-checkpoint blockers. PIIO-1 augments CD8+ T cells-induced anti-tumor immunity and overcomes ICB resistance by disrupting transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), the center of a pathway significantly implicated in solid tumors and hematological malignancies. PIIO-1 inhibits TGF\u03b2 locally via a docking receptor, avoiding adverse and unforeseen side effects.\n\n**The Need**\nAlthough immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has emerged as a promising cancer immunotherapy, a majority of tumors fail to respond to ICB. A potential mechanism driving this failed response is the accumulation of TGF-\u03b21 in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which drives immune dysfunction by inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs), while excluding and inhibiting the function of effector CD8+ T cells, among others. Given the pleotropic, multifunctional nature of TGF-\u03b2, systemic inhibition has multiple side effects and been clinically challenging. As such, developing translatable approaches to inhibit TGF\u03b2 locally in the TME is of paramount importance.\n\n**The Technology**\nResearchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Zihai Li, have developed an antibody (PIIO-1) that binds to glycoprotein-A repetitions predominant (GARP) and inhibits the activation of GARP-bound latent TGF\u03b2 and downstream signaling. GARP, encoded by Lrrc32, is a cell surface, non-signaling, docking, and activating receptor for latent TGF\u03b2 that is highly expressed in cancer cells, activated Tregs, and platelets. Blocking this signaling pathway has been shown to overcome tumor resistance to ICB.\n\nTherapeutic targeting of TGF\u03b2 is expected to have beneficial effects through two mechanisms: via its direct effect on tumor cells, and via modulation of the TME that leads to increased immunosurveillance. The Li team discovered that genetic deletion of Lrrc32 in Tregs or platelets enhanced protection against inflammation-associated colorectal cancer and MC38 colon cancer. They validated GARP as a therapeutic target by generating a monoclonal antibody and demonstrated enhanced antitumor immunity when combined with PD1 blockade in a mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer. The antibody treatment diminishes TGF\u03b2 signaling in the TME and significantly reduces metastasis. The antibody has been humanized (as PIIO-1), and a novel human LRRC32 knock-in mouse generated to the endogenous Lrrc32 locus to further test this therapeutic. In models of breast cancer, they found that PIIO-1 therapy reduced lung metastases and Tregs (Fig 1 A-C), and augmented efficacy when combined with chemotherapy (Fig 1 D-F).

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "A novel orally-active drug molecule that can inhibit pathological CD4+ T-cells at clinically translatable doses and, blunts progressive cardiac dysfunction and left-ventricular (LV) remodeling during Heart Failure (HF). HF afflicts ~6.5 million adults in US with 50% mortality in first 5 years. It has an estimated market size of $4.2B USD in US alone with a forecasted CAGR of 23% from 2018-2028. Current HF treatments are mostly aimed at alleviating symptoms rather than treatment, resulting in progressive cardiac dysfunction and LV remodeling. It is clear that inflammation and immune cell activation play a critical pathophysiological role in the development of HF. However, clinical trials aimed at neutralizing pro-inflammatory cytokines failed in HF patients and, paradoxically, showed increased mortality and morbidity, probably mainly due to two reasons: 1) cytokines exert highly non-specific and wide ranging effects on different cell types, some of which are necessary for healing, and 2) appropriate timing of immunomodulatory therapies may be critical to ensure appropriate healing. This analysis suggests that temporal modulation of selective pathological immune cells would be a better approach to manage HF. However, no such therapies exist in the clinics. Researchers at the Ohio State University, led by Dr. Shyam S. Bansal, have identified that CD4+ T cells undergo a pathological change during chronic HF, and studies in male mice showed that estrogen receptor (ER) \u03b1 signaling plays an important role in promoting this pathological effect. In collaboration with the OSU\u2019s Drug Development Institute, researchers identified a highly selective, non-steroidal small molecule ER\u03b2 agonist (OSU-ERb-012) that can functionally block the undesired effects of ER\u03b1. This novel molecule was designed and developed at the Ohio State University and is orally active, with no known side-effects at up to 200 mg/kg (oral dosing) in rodents. Activating ER\u03b2 signaling at a specific time-point during HF (which can be identified by systemic changes in T-cells) completely blunts left-ventricular remodeling and stops progressive cardiac dysfunction in male mice. Ex vivo and in vivo studies further confirmed that this drug selectively inhibited activated pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cells without affecting other immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, B-cells or CD8+ T cells. Ex vivo studies also showed similar effects on T cells isolated from female mice. Analogs of OSU-ERb-012 are in development. Commercial Applications: Pharmaceutical, Medicine, Small molecule, Estrogen receptor signaling, Heart failure.

    "ip_description": "A novel protein-drug conjugate of human serum albumin chemically conjugated to SN-38, solubilizing the potent chemotherapeutic. This therapy has the potential to treat many tumors with poor prognosis, including pancreatic, lung, breast, colorectal, ovarian, sarcoma, head and neck cancer, urothelial malignancies, and others.\n\n**The Need**\nMany solid tumors have poor prognosis despite recent progress in molecularly targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Irinotecan/CPT-11, a chemotherapy on the WHO Essential Medicines List, is approved for use in colorectal cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, malignant glioma, and sarcoma. However, only a small percentage of irinotecan is converted to its active metabolite SN-38 (3%), and the ability to achieve therapeutically effective plasma levels of SN-38 is further complicated by systemic circulation, liver uptake, and drug metabolism. SN-38 is 1,000 times more potent than irinotecan, yet cannot be delivered on its own due to poor solubility and high toxicity. Finding a more effective way to deliver this potent chemotherapeutic to the tumor microenvironment (TME) is urgently needed.\n\n**The Technology**\nDr. Terry Williams (oncologist, formerly of The Ohio State University and presently City of Hope) and Dr. Robert Lee (of The Ohio State University) have developed a novel albumin-SN-38 conjugate that significantly increases the solubility and availability of SN-38 (AlbuCure). In human pancreatic and lung cancer cell lines and mouse xenograft models, AlbuCure demonstrates high potency with relative safety, and also marked improvement over irinotecan. The researchers also identified caveolin-1 (Cav-1) as a potential predictive biomarker for treatment efficacy. Expression of Cav-1 (the principal structural component of caveolae) is upregulated in many tumor types and associated with poor prognosis. At the same time, caveolae-mediated endocytosis facilitates cellular uptake of albumin. Another albumin-based chemotherapy, nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane\u00ae), approved by the FDA to treat pancreatic, non-small cell lung, and breast cancers, has limited efficacy due to albumin and paclitaxel carried in the formulation falling apart easily. AlbuCure also represents a potential substantial improvement over this chemotherapy, by virtue of increased delivery of SN-38 to the TME, and may be particularly effective for tumors characterized by increased albumin uptake, including those with high Cav-1 expression or activated macropinocytosis (associated with KRAS mutations). The more stable protein-drug chemical conjugate by OSU researchers could potentially change the landscape of protein-drug conjugates in cancer therapy.\n\n**Commercial Applications**\n*   Targeted cancer therapy\n*   Cancer recurrence prevention\n\n**Benefits/ Advantages**\n*   Targeting a broad range of cancer types with activated nutrient scavenging, tumor metabolism, and activation of caveolae-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and KRAS mutations\n*   Superior antitumor efficacy compared to existing therapeutics such as irinotecan\n*   May overcome drug resistance\n*   Prevents cancer recurrence\n*   May be used as monotherapy or in combination",

    "ip_description": "A high-temperature metal oxide semiconductor based gas sensor that is doped with noble metals to increase stability and selectively. Machines that burn fuel for operation require numerous safety features to detect leaks of volatile and toxic gases that can be harmful or deadly to people if inhaled. Of these gases produced during combustion, carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the most important to consider due to its lethal capability and the long-term adverse health effects of non-fatal CO poisoning. In addition to safety requirements, the manufacturing industry monitors CO levels to balance the oxygen (O2) to fuel ratio during combustion. By monitoring CO levels, an ideal balance of O2 to fuel can be maintained during industrial processes which can increase the life of an engine and minimize the pollution produced. When unable to monitor CO levels, manufacturers tend to run lean in order to avoid explosions but this kind of operation can result in engine knocking and the formation of NOx species. Existing gas sensors are made from metal oxide semiconductors (MOS) that usually exhibit low selectivity and respond indiscriminately to a broad spectrum of reactive gases. In addition to an indiscriminate response, state of the art detectors and sensors based on MOS will often exhibit unstable baseline resistance, continuous drift, and poor recovery time. In order to properly monitor the amount of CO present within engines or industrial machinery, a sensor that demonstrates robust performance in high temperature environments and selective detection must be developed. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Prabir Dutta, have developed a composite sensor that is capable of determining the concentration of CO within a mixture and demonstrates stable high-temperature operation. The composite sensor is MOS-based and its surface is doped with noble metals to improve selectivity and stability. The sensor is able to detect sub-ppm levels of CO within a gas mixture with range extending up to 1,000 ppm. The composite sensor has been demonstrated to provide sensitive, low drift and fast-recovering detection of CO within a high-temperature environment ranging from about 400\u00b0C to about 800\u00b0C.",

Although extensive research and development over the past two decades has resulted in close to 100% external quantum efficiency (EQE) of InGaN based blue light emitting devices, efficiency of the longer visible wavelength emitting devices has remained relatively low. Spontaneous polarization originating from the absence of inversion symmetry in the wurtzite structure and piezoelectric polarization caused by the lattice mismatch induced strain in InGaN quantum wells based light-emitting devices render internal electric field and concomitant localization of electron and holes in different regions of the QW.

Computer processors are used every minute of every day in phones, cars, computers, TVs, and as the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d expands to refrigerators, toasters, and more processers define how we live our lives. These processors rely on mechanical oscillators and resonators that work together to keep stable frequency references. That stable frequency is used to precisely track time, manage data transfer, and define radio frequencies. Micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) resonator-based oscillators show promise over traditional crystal oscillators due to faster responding, lower power consumption, and ability of miniaturization with integrated circuit technology. With micron-sized dimensions, the MEMS oscillators often need to run nonlinearly to obtain large signal-to-noise ratio, which leads to degradation of their frequency stability. At a micro or nano level, MEMS temperature fluctuations, moisture change, absorbing molecules, and small photons will affect frequency stabilization.

Nitric oxide plays an important role in the biological system of living organisms. It has been shown to regulate and mediate numerous processes in the nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems by transmitting signals throughout the body. It is used within the cardiovascular system to regulate smooth muscle relaxation, dilation of blood vessels, enlargement of arteries and blood flow. Nitric oxide is also used by the nervous system as a neurotransmitter to regulate various bodily functions such as digestion, blood flow, memory and vision. Furthermore, it is produced by macrophages in the immune system and can help kill bacteria, parasites and tumor cells by disrupting their metabolism. Besides mediating normal biological functions, nitric oxide also provides benefits when in pathophysiologic states including septic shock, hypertension, stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. The amount of nitric oxide in exhaled breath can also provide a convenient measure of inflammation in the respiratory system which can help diagnose and treat asthma. Typical methods for detecting nitric oxide include optical spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, chromatography, chemiluminescence, and electrochemistry. Due to the important role of nitric oxide as a messenger molecule in various bodily systems, a convenient method for measuring and monitoring the amount of it within the body must be developed.

Given the burden of this disease, a large pipeline of drugs for treatment are in progress. Thus, research tools that address the specific biological characteristics of CLL are of high value. Currently there are several CLL mouse models, but none that address the over expression of the human MTCP1 gene only in B-lymphocytes. Furthermore, more aggressive models are needed to address the needs of patients that have tried both BTK and BCL2 inhibitors. Dr. Lapalombella and colleagues have developed a transgenic immunocompetent mouse model that overexpress the human MTCP1 gene only in B-lymphocytes. Mice positive for the trans gene develop with age (starting at 4-6 months) a leukemia that has similar features of the human CLL. This mouse allows researchers to conduct longitudinal studies of _in vivo_ tumor development, immune modulation and microenvironment, as well as response to novel therapies. Mouse models of leukemia are well known to be a widely accepted and used tool for PK, PD, and therapeutic studies. Many novel drugs that have reached clinical trials have shown response in murine tumor models so we believe this will be a great tool to be used by investigators at research institutions and pharmaceutical companies to test new drugs for the treatment of CLL. Commercial Applications: * Novel Drug Studies * Clinical Trial Safety Evaluations * Longitudinal Studies of Tumor Development * Alternative to TCL1-based model. Benefits/Advantages: * Novel mouse model for CLL * Can be used for various _in vivo_ studies across the drug development pipeline * Rapid disease development.",

    "ip_description": "Dressing designed and tailored exclusively for insertion sheaths with side ports, used frequently for pulmonary artery catheters (PACs or Swan-Ganz catheters) among other intravascular devices in the hospital. Central-line associated blood stream infections (CLABSIs) are a life-threatening and extremely costly problem in hospitals around the world. When patients in the hospital have indwelling catheters such as pulmonary artery catheters, they are at an increased risk of developing infections. Occlusive dressings are used to prevent bacteria from entering the sterile space of the insertion site. The dressings currently used for pulmonary artery catheters are not optimally designed to accommodate the insertion sheath with side port and the PAC catheter extending out of the insertion sheath. Because of design limitations, it is difficult for healthcare providers to make adjustments to the catheter without altering the dressing and risking contamination. Currently, dressing has a 'one-design-fits-all' approach even though there are many types of indwelling catheters used in the hospital. Given, the limited options for dressings and clinical risk associated with injections site contamination, there is a clear need for an improved design that specifically accommodates the side ports and unique attributes of insertion sheaths and PACs. Samantha Warren, RN and Jordan Thomas, MD, working at The Ohio State University Ross Heart Hospital, have designed an improved dressing to be used for insertion sheaths with side ports. The dressing is designed to accommodate insertion sheaths with side ports and allows manipulation of the locking mechanism of the PAC while minimizing the risk of sterile field interruption. This dressing, which was principally designed for use with PACs, has the potential to be used in additional applications including any catheters or intravascular medical devices that require insertion sheaths. The dressing was designed in association with the Innovation Studio at The Ohio State University and a prototype was created using 3D printing software and a laser-cutting machine. This dressing is designed for ease in health care access and is flexible enough to increase patient movement. The dressing incorporates a new design that can accommodate a side port located either on the right side or left side of the body. This flexibility allows a healthcare professional to change or alter the dressing in less time without compromising the sterile environment. Commercial Applications: A dressing to be used for insertion sheaths with side ports including those utilized for PACs or other intravascular devices in clinical environments. Benefits/Advantages: Decreased contamination or infection risk, Improved patient comfort, Easy access to locking mechanism while maintaining sterility at insertion site.",

    "ip_description": "A variable thickness liquid film target is generated at repetition rates in excess of 10 Hz for laser interaction applications. Intense laser-matter experiments utilize high-powered lasers that generate extreme temperatures and pressures to impact small, thin targets that are usually solid metallic foils millimeters in length and nanometers to microns in thickness. The number of particles accelerated and amount of radiation generated when the laser interacts with such a target depends on the target thickness and makeup. While lasers can fire many times per second, no current techniques provide targets with these characteristics at high repetition rates. In addition, the lengthy procedure of target alignment often decreases the effective experimental shot rate to a few times per hour. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Douglass Schumacher, developed an apparatus that repeatedly forms films for use as targets in intense laser-matter experiments. These films operate as ideal targets in laser experiments with repetition rates in excess of 10 times per second. The targets are produced by forming liquid crystals into films that are destroyed during the initial laser shot but then reformed in precisely the same position before the next laser shot arrives, eliminating the need for realignment. Commercial Applications: Particle acceleration, Fusion, X-rays, Other forms of radiation production, Pulse cleaners, Laser manufacturing, Medical technology, Scientific research.

    "ip_description": "An Ultra-wideband (8 to 1 continuous bandwidth), extremely low profile, wide angle scanning, phased array with integrated compact balun and feed structure. Tightly Coupled Dipole Arrays (TCDAs) are popular due to their wide bandwidth, good scan performance, low profile, and low cross polarization. However, to realize their full potential, a wideband balanced feed is required. Compact wideband baluns are difficult to realize, and previous dipole arrays with self-contained feeds have yielded only modest bandwidths (<2:1). Wideband TCDAs have therefore typically been realized using \u201cfeed-organizers\u201d with bulky external baluns located below the ground plane. This significantly increases the total size, weight, and cost of the array. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Jonathan Doane and Dr. Kubilay Sertel, have constructed a wideband antenna array that has better bandwidth and scanning capabilities than other arrays of similar size. This antenna eliminates the need for bulky external baluns and impedance transformers. In addition, the technology integrates the feed circuitry directly into the array volume, which reduces size, weight, and cost of the device. Their approach feeds are structured for proper TCDA operation and implement higher-order impedance matching for improved array bandwidth. This novel design exploits the natural reactant of a compact Marchand balun as an impedance matching network for each element.

In order to gain simultaneous control over the positions of many MTB relative to an underlying surface, the method seeks to exploit variability in certain properties among individual MTB in a population. When a magnetic field is applied to a motile MTB, its swimming axis aligns with the magnetic field. However, the trajectory of an MTB swimming near a surface is also dependent on the hydrodynamic interactions with the wall.

As part of the pre-operative planning for surgery, x-ray images are taken to determine the proper fit for the implant.

    "ip_description": "The ultrasonically assisted wire additive manufacturing process and apparatus is a new innovation that uses power ultrasound (UA) for benefits in processing molten metals. The UA energy is directly applied in the local deposition pool, which makes this new hybrid process applicable for building parts with any size and geometry. Additive manufacturing (AM) is the process of 3D printing for industrial use. Instead of countertop devices printing small toys from plastic, industrial AM is used on a much larger scale to create engine blocks, plane components, and many other products made of metal alloys. AM is traditionally done using a powder, where a thin layer of powder is dropped then melted on an X & Y plane using a laser. The powder process is repeated until the part is completed. The excess powder is then disposed of. Wire additive manufacturing (WAM), instead of powder, using a spool of wire and a heat source to melt layers of metal on top each other to form the part. WAM is advantageous over powder manufacturing because of its minimal replacement of subtracting machining, thereby making a better product faster. For example, steel arc-based WAM can achieve a deposition rate of 10kg/hr compared to 600g/hr for powder-based processes. Although WAM is faster than powder-based processes, WAM shares the same disadvantages when it comes to the solidification microstructure nature of the metal, including coarse columnar grains, porosities, cracks, interdendritic segregation and the lack of strengthening phases. To enhance WAM and make a better product, an innovation is needed to improve the microstructure and accordingly mechanical properties. Researchers at The Ohio State University\u2019s Department of Materials Science and Engineering, led by Dr. Xun Liu, have developed the ultrasonically assisted WAM (UA-WAM) that improves upon the general WAM by process, microstructure, and product quality. The method introduces UA energy from a probe inserted into the local melt pool where it will vibrate at a certain ultrasonic frequency. UA-WAM improves the WAM process by enlarging the processing window and increasing tolerance for welding wire quality. The microstructure of the product is improved by decreasing porosity, suppressing solidification cracking, refining microstructure, and homogenizing element distribution. These improvements result in a higher quality product that can withstand higher mechanical forces. Finally, since the UA probe is inserted directly in the local deposition pool and travels together with the welding torch, there is no restrictions on the size and geometry of the built part by the UA system. Furthermore, the UA energy efficiency is significantly higher than existing practices where UA is indirectly supplied from the building substrate. Industry professionals will be able to use the UA's versatility to achieve the best product that is stronger and more durable than products made with traditional WAM techniques.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "This is a new method of resistance spot welding of aluminum alloy and advanced high strength steel that creates a stronger bond by using a chromium-rich interlayer. The interlayer improves joint strength, ductility, and toughness compared to traditional methods. Resistance welding is used to combine two metals at one point. This technique is used extensively in automotive manufacturing, combining an aluminum (Al) to an advanced high strength steel (AHSS) structure. Welding Al and AHSS together directly, however, does not create a high-quality bond, due to Al and AHSS having different melting points and chemical makeups. A thick and brittle intermetallic compound (IMC) layer can form when the Al and AHSS are combined in this manner. The IMC layer, if not controlled, deteriorates the weld's load-bearing capacity. As the automotive industry continues to move toward joining Al and AHSS, there must be an efficient way to form a high strength bond between the two metals that avoids these brittle intermetallic zones and provides the desired mechanical properties. Researchers at The Ohio State University have invented a process of applying a Cr-rich interlayer (such as pure Cr, electroplated Cr coating, ferritic stainless steels, and Cr containing structural C-steels) between the Al alloy and steel plates to make a much stronger bound, before resistance spot welding and other joining processes. The Cr interlayer has been shown to preclude or reduce the formation of brittle IMC interlayer. This invention expands the joining processes parameter window and dramatically improves the joint strength ductility, and toughness of the bound. Commercial Applications: Automotive Manufacturing, Aerospace manufacturing, Armored vehicles, Ship structures, Heat exchangers, Pipeline industry. Benefits/Advantages: Stronger bond between Al and steel, Increase processing window, Minimal modification of the well-established RSW technique, Interlayer materials widely available to industry, Applicable for different steel/aluminum alloys. The Ohio State Welding Engineering department continues to have a significant impact on innovation, competitiveness, and the sustainability of fabrication, welding, and additive manufacturing. The industry faces the dual challenge of introducing new materials into products of the future and assuring that current materials meet performance requirements. Both challenges require a better fundamental knowledge of materials joining and additive manufacturing.

There are thousands of monogenic diseases that are lacking effective therapeutic treatments. The main bottleneck in developing effective treatment is the ability to effectively edit gene while controlling for the myriad of off-target effects that come with targeting the genome. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is once such monogenic disease that is caused by genetic mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes the dystrophin protein. The mutations including missense point mutations, nonsense point mutations, deletions, and insertions lead to the disruption of dystrophin protein translation. Correction of such mutations or restoration of the reading frame by skipping the mutant exons can rescue the expression of dystrophin and serves as a treatment for the disease. A number of molecular approaches have been developed to change the genetic codes on the chromosome DNA. One of such approaches utilizes the so-called \u201cbase editors\u201d, which are engineered by fusing a nucleotide deaminase (such as cytidine deaminase or adenosine deaminase) with a Cas9 nickase. The most widely and best-characterized Cas9 is the one from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9), which requires an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence on the target DNA, thereby restricting the targetable genomic loci. There exists a need to improve base editors, including their Cas9 variants, the deaminase specificity and efficiency, and the infrastructure for AAV packaging and delivery. A more effective combination of Cas9 variant, deaminase domain and the split version for AAV packaging would be helpful in correcting gene mutations and serving as a treatment for genetic diseases. Dr. Renzhi Han and colleagues have developed an improved adenine base editor (iABE-NG) that uses an SpCas9 variant to correct mutations in genetic diseases. The iABE-NG includes an improved SpCas9-NG which carries all the mutations in SpCas9-NG and R1335Q, a single adenine deaminase with A56G and V82G mutations which eliminates the off-target RNA editing activities, and a super-fast Gp41-1 intein split for AAV packaging. The iABE-NG allows targeted _in vivo_ editing of a single nucleotide from A to G or T to C with high efficiencies at NG PAM sites. The team demonstrated that the recombinant AAV carrying iABE-NG can be used to correct dystrophin point mutations in a mouse model of DMD and cultured human cells. Significantly, the team demonstrated that a single injection of the recombinant AAV particles at 5 weeks of age converted over 95% of cardiomyocytes from dystrophin-negative to dystrophin-positive at 10 months of age. Beyond treating DMD, the novel recombinant AAV with iABE-NG also holds the promise to correct gene mutations in treatments of various diseases, such as Cystic fibrosis, Phenylketonuria (PKU), Sickle-cell anemia, Huntington\u2019s disease, Myotonic dystrophy, Hemophilia A, X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy, and familial dilated cardiomyopathy.",

    "ip_description": "This technology is a Vehicle-in-Virtual Environment (VVE) method for testing and evaluating Autonomous Vehicles (AV). The VVE approach is a safe, reliable, repetitive, and scalable method of testing AVs, decreasing the risks and costs of testing AVs on public roads. The demand for autonomous vehicles continues to grow as companies and cities realize the effect on the costs, safety, and efficiency that AVs have on everyday lives. Initiatives such as MCity in Detroit, Michigan, and Smart City in Columbus, Ohio, show a strong commitment to the development of autonomous vehicles and increasing demand. With that increasing demand is a necessity for safety and evaluation of the vehicle and pre-deployment demonstration of operation. AV testing and development relies heavily on simulation of the software, hardware and then combined with the vehicle. After a brief period of testing on a controlled proving ground area, the bulk of testing is done on public roads. Proving grounds are limited to what can be physically recreated in a closed lot, so the randomness and variety of public roads cannot be sufficiently recreated. It takes a large amount of time and resources to recreate physical scenarios in a closed lot. These issues lead to AVs not being thoroughly tested before being put on public roads leading to increased costs and risk of accident. Therefore, there is a need to test AVs more thoroughly in realistic environments before they are put on public roads. Researchers at The Ohio State, led by Dr. Bilin Aksun Guvenc and Dr. Levent Guvenc, have developed a Vehicle-in-Virtual Environment (VVE) method to improve testing of AVs before the AV is evaluated on public roads. VVE technology creates a virtual environment that can simulate public roads and random events in a closed parking lot. The car is 'seeing' the virtual environment but is driving around a closed lot. The virtual environment has different test scenarios including buildings, vegetation, infrastructure, other road users, weather effects, road irregularities, irregularly parked obstacles, deep billboard effects, suddenly appearing obstacles, false positives, false negatives, weather effects on sensor outputs and other sensor falsification effects. VVE provides for significantly more scenarios than what can be physically recreated at a fraction of the time and cost. VVE uses a realistic game engine to produce a 3D environment for the car's sensors to take in. The environment is built using existing map data and images of that environment. A city, for example, that wants to evaluate an AV shuttle can virtually put that shuttle on its route, instead of jeopardizing the public\u2019s safety. The flexibility of VVE allows the recreation of almost any real-life scenario with reduced costs and increased safety. Commercial Applications: Developing, testing, and evaluating autonomous vehicles and their control systems for manufacturers (automotive OEMs, suppliers, technology companies), Evaluating autonomous vehicles for cities and municipalities, Demonstrating technology and operation before deployment for autonomous ride companies, Taxi, ridesharing, food-delivery services (Uber, Lyft, Grubhub). Benefits/Advantages: Lowers the development time, cost and accident risk of AV system development and testing, Allows for the recreation of possible accident environments to find software or hardware issues. Research Interest: The Automated Driving Lab (ADL) at The Ohio State University where this technology was developed has expertise in automotive control, ADAS and connected and autonomous driving. They specialize in path planning and path tracking control, collision avoidance maneuvering, pedestrian and other vulnerable road user safety, data-driven end to mid autonomous driving, safe handling of connected intersections by autonomous vehicles, cooperative autonomous driving, fuel/energy efficiency using connectivity and cooperation and planning and evaluation of autonomous vehicle deployments. The ADL specializes in evaluation, testing and demonstration of connected and autonomous driving functions and deployments and has conducted the realistic simulation-based pre-deployment evaluation of the recent Linden Residential Area autonomous shuttle deployment of Smart Columbus.",

    "ip_description": "Uncontrolled hemolysis (i.e., destruction of red blood cells) is characterized by the increase of circulating toxic cell-free hemoglobin, heme and iron in the bloodstream. In vivo, the body\u2019s natural supply of plasma scavenger proteins acts to neutralize these toxic species. However, these scavenger proteins such as haptoglobin, hemopexin and transferrin, which detoxify hemoglobin, heme and iron, respectively, are depleted in various clinical conditions such as hemorrhagic shock, burns, surgery, organ transplantation, sepsis and trauma. Dr. Andre Palmer\u2019s lab at The Ohio State University has developed a novel therapeutic protein mixture, which can be used to treat plasma protein imbalances or depletion caused by the adverse events described above. The properties of this protein mixture are beneficial as they lend themselves to an inexpensive manufacturing process and potential improvements in clinical outcomes. Fluid replacement as part of resuscitation efforts in clinical care is a cornerstone of treatment especially in cases with severe trauma. The regular usage of these fluids in hospitals requires the mixture to be easily transported, easily stored and applicable across a wide variety of patients. To date, much of the improvements in this space have been focused on the lyophilization of these fluids which has greatly improved access at point-of-care. However, there are several barriers including the need for crossmatching blood groups, cost-effectiveness and deleterious side-effects. Accordingly, most fluid resuscitation strategies rely on simple crystalloid (salt) solutions which only provide fluid volume without direct treatment of harmful substances released under these conditions. The technology innovates the methods to create a cocktail of proteins to treat hemorrhagic shock, burns, surgery, organ transplantation, sepsis or trauma. The protein cocktail was made utilizing tangential flow filtration (TFF) and consists of a novel mixture of haptoglobin, hemopexin, albumin, transferrin, vitamin-D binding protein and ceruloplasmin. Human serum albumin (HSA) provides plasma expansion properties but additionally has toxin scavenging and antioxidant proteins. Thus, not only can the protein cocktail replace fluid volume, but also contains a mixture of proteins that can mitigate hemolysis-associated toxicities. The biophysical properties of the protein mixture are also desirable in a fluid resuscitation product as it is fully biocompatible and has great viscous properties for these applications. Overall, this scavenging protein cocktail, meets all the clinical needs for the treatment of hemorrhagic shock, burns, surgery, organ transplantation, sepsis or trauma with additional properties that make it superior to what is on the market. In summary, this cocktail has a multitude of benefits including the ability to be used across all blood groups, scalability of manufacturing and ease of transport. Thus, this technology serves an important gap in the market and is poised to make positive clinical impacts.",

Butanol has tremendous promise as an additive to gasoline and diesel to render the combustion of these fuels efficient and clean. Economical means of _ex vivo_ regeneration of NAD(P)H from the NAD(P)+, the product of NADPH oxidation, would enable biosynthesis of butanol from butyraldehyde to continue unabated even if cellular redox is no longer available. In brief, a p-type semiconductor, Cu2O (cuprous oxide), is electrodeposited onto a copper mesh to a thickness of tens of microns. A protective and catalytic layer (thickness estimated to be in tens of nanometers) of Ni (nickel) is then deposited using dc sputtering. This Ni/Cu2O/Cu nano-heterolayer is then photoelectrochemically treated in phosphate buffer using visible light from a 10-mW green (532 nm) laser for one hour to enable surface modification and use as a novel cathode for electrochemical conversion of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H.

    "ip_description": "This application relates generally to a novel redox relay flow batteries comprising redox-active solids configured to behave as storage materials and redox-active organic molecules configured to behave as energy shuttles. The growing global demand for electrical energy has increased research efforts towards the integration of renewable energy sources into the electrical grid. Generation of energy from petroleum-based sources dominates the current market, but dependence on renewable energy is expected to grow rapidly. For example, photovoltaic installations have outpaced annual predictions and are approaching terawatt scales at prices <$0.50/W. However, many issues associated with renewable energy impedes their full integration into the electrical grid. We report the development of hybrid RFBs that contain redox-active organic solids (ROSs). Rather than forcing these solids to charge/discharge directly at the electrode, small quantities of solvated redox-active organic molecules (ROMs) will relay electrons between the ROSs and the distal current collectors. The resulting redox relay flow battery (RRFB) will be scalable, have high energy density, and be synthetically modular. The RRFB is a hybrid storage system with a number of key advantages over current RFBs. First, the energy density of the RRFB scales with capacity (mass of ROS added), rather than with solubility. Such systems can function with over 20 mol of actives per kg solvent, which greatly exceeds RFB limits (<1mol/kg solvent). At such energy densities, cost-competitive storage can be achieved at lower cell voltages(~2 V) than current RFB targets. Second, excessively high concentrations of solvated shuttle are not required because energy density is dictated by the loading of the ROS. This lower shuttle concentration reduces solution viscosity, slows bimolecular decomposition pathways of solvated compounds, and eliminates the cost associated with extensive synthetic derivatization to prepare highly soluble ROMs. Finally, the ROSs will be loaded into interchangeable cartridges. This design allows the energy-dense cartridges to be charged at one site and easily transported for discharge to a geographic site where harvesting renewable energy is challenging. RRFBs have high energy density and thus are very efficient for their size. The cartridge-based system allows for easy transportation of energy from one site to another. Lower concentrations of solvated shuttle are required, significantly reducing the cost per battery.",

Aberrant expression of HOX genes is associated with NPM1-mutations in AML and HOX-related lncRNAs have been reported to regulate HOX genes. Accordingly, HOXB-AS3 is believed to bear a functional role in this disease setting and is a novel target for treatment. The Ohio State University researchers, led by Dr. Ramiro Garzon, have discovered that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with nucleophosmism (NPM1) mutations exhibit high expression of a non-coding RNA called HOXBAS3. The researchers studied the functional consequences of this lncRNA in cell lines and primary AML samples by blocking or repressing the expression of this lncRNA using novel locked nucleic acid (LNA) gapmer technology. Results demonstrate _HOXB-AS3_ regulates the proliferative capacity of _NPM1_mut AML blasts _in vitro_ and _in vivo_. Treatment of patient derived xenografts with anti-_HOXB-AS3_ gapmers led to significantly prolonged median survival (63 vs >100 days).

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "circPCMTD1 is a novel target in p53 mutated leukemias. Despite recent progress in understanding acute myeloid leukemia (AML) biology and the use of intensive treatments, the long-term overall survival of non-pediatric AML patients is only 30-40% in young patients (<60 years) and less than 10% in elderly AML patients (>60 years). This highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches for adult AML patients. Circular RNA (circRNA) is characterized by perturbed arrangement of exons that lack a poly-A tail and are generally believed to lack protein coding potential. circRNAs can sequester microRNAs (miRs) and function as miR sponges, consequently acting as global regulators of cellular processes in cancer cells. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Ramiro Garzon, have discovered a prognostic and biological function of circular PCMTD1 (circPCMTD1) in leukemia. The inventors demonstrated that high expression of circPCMTD1 in AML patients significantly correlates with poorer clinical outcomes, whereas expression of linear PCMTD1 (linPCMTD1) is not a prognostic indicator. Despite traditional dogma that circRNAs lack protein coding potential, the inventors surprisingly discovered a novel 35kD protein translated from circPCMTD1. Using an anti-circPCMTD1gapmer to target circular, but not linPCMTD1, the inventors showed that knockdown of circPCMTD1 eliminates expression of the 35kD protein and impairs DNA replication by preventing the formation of the BTR complex, which plays a critical role in DNA replication and repair. AML cells experienced a significant increase in G2/M cell cycle arrest following circPCMTD1 knockdown, an effect that was rescued using a peptide sequence identified in the circPCMTD1 open reading frame. Together, these studies suggest circPCMTD1 is indispensable for the proliferation of leukemic myeloblasts and targeting the circPCMTD1 RNA or circPCMTD1-derived protein may be an effective therapeutic approach for AML patients.

Numerous cancer cells are capable of migration, resulting in metastasis of distinct organs and tissues from where the cancer first arose. Migrating cancer cells are known to directionally respond to applied electric fields, a phenomenon called electrotaxis, as well as topological cues provided by narrow microtracks < 10 m diameter. Tools to enhance our understanding of the mechanism of cancer cell migration are therefore critical in order to achieve the goal of preventing metastasis. However, there are a dearth of devices capable of assessing various stimuli on cancer cell motility using facile, real-time visualization methodologies.

    "ip_description": "The Need\nDespite high vaccine coverage, whooping cough caused by Bordetella pertussis remains one of the most common vaccine-preventable diseases worldwide. Introduction of whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccines in the 1940s and acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines in 1990s reduced mortality due to pertussis. Despite induction of both antibody and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses by aP and wP vaccines, there has been resurgence of pertussis in many countries in recent years. Possible hypotheses for pertussis resurgence include (i) incompliance with the recommended vaccination programmes using the currently used aP vaccine and (ii) infection with resurged clinical isolates characterised by mutations in the virulence factors, resulting in antigenic divergence with vaccine strain, and increased production of pertussis toxin, resulting in dampening of immune responses. While use of these vaccines provide varying degrees of protection against whooping cough, protection against infection and transmission appears to be less effective, warranting continued efforts in the development of an improved pertussis vaccine.\n\nThe Technology\nResearchers at the Ohio State University have developed an acellular _B. pertussus and B. bronchiseptica_ vaccine comprising the immunogenic BcfA (Bordetella colonization factor A) protein, which with remarkable efficacy establishes protective immunity _in vivo_ against Bordetella infections.

    "ip_description": "A gene therapy solution for Usher Syndrome Type 1F. Mutations in PCDH15 cause Usher 1F, a recessive syndrome characterized by profound congenital deafness and absence of vestibular function, and progressive blindness beginning in the second decade. Because patients who lack hearing and balance rely on vision for communication and mobility, the late-onset blindness is particularly devastating. Currently, treatment for Usher 1F is limited to cochlear implants, and there is no treatment for the related blindness. Gene addition therapy could be an attractive treatment for those with homozygous recessive mutations. However, the PCDH15 coding sequence of ~5.8 kb is too large to fit into a single AAV capsid, which is limited to ~4.7 kb of transgene. Moreover, although conventional AAV vectors are safe and are currently used in clinical trials, none has led to efficient expression in most types of cells in the inner ear and the cells in the eye. Thus, new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of congential deafness are needed. Dr. Marcos Sotomayor of the Ohio State University has designed a mini-PCDH15 gene based on the protocadherin-15 protein structural biochemical determinants. The strategically designed mini-PCDH15 gene is small enough to fit into a single AAV genome for delivery into cells of the inner ear across multiple species for the treatment of hereditary hearing loss, for example, as in Usher Syndrome Type 1F. The mini-PCDH15 construct demonstrated functional competency in multiple aspects when evaluated _in vitro._ The constructs were then evaluated in a floxed mouse having hair cell-specific knockout of PCDH15. AAV was injected into the inner ear of mice. Treated and untreated mice were evaluated using functional and behavioral readouts of auditory function. Treated mice showed significant improvements compared to controls. Thus, this invention may be a viable therapeutic for the treatment of Usher Syndrome Type 1F. Competitive Advantages: * Gene therapy solution to incurable disease * Strong intellectual property position.

    "ip_name": "Method for seamless joining and repair of metal parts using ultrasonic additive manufacturing",
    "ip_number": "T2020-005",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "This invention provides a method for repairing metal parts by removing and replacing worn, damaged, or defective metal material. It also serves as a method for seamlessly joining metal sheets and other parts while retaining the original temper of the joined parts. This technology, based on ultrasonic additive manufacturing (UAM), achieves strong joints and repairs by enabling the filling of a channel that has been cut, formed, or otherwise created in a metal structure or between two metal structures.\n\nThe Need\n\nThe aircraft industry requires robust methods for joining metal sheets, structures, and assemblies together in wings, fuselages, and engines. Fusion-based welding methods cannot always be used because they create heat-affected zones, which reduce the mechanical performance of material around the weld. In addition, there is a need for repair of parts that have been damaged, worn, or corroded during operation. This is particularly important for life critical and high value components often used in aerospace, automotive, and oil and gas applications. A common practice is to scrap parts when damage is detected, adding cost and downtime. This invention enables ultrasonic additive manufacturing (UAM) to provide solutions for both metal sheet joining and damage repair. In addition, this technology allows high-strength reinforcement or sensors to be embedded during the repair and joining processes.\n\nAdditive manufacturing (AM) can significantly optimize the speed and costs of prototyping, manufacturing, and customization of products. Recent innovations have expanded the breadth of material choices possible for AM and thus its applicability. A recent BCC research summary (IAS102C) reports that additive manufacturing of metals is expected to grow from a global market of 91.5 million USD in 2017 to 5.3 billion USD by 2023 with a CAGR of 34%. UAM utilizes a cylindrical sonotrode to grip layers of foil feedstock and apply lateral (y-direction) displacements via ultrasonic vibrations to create a scrubbing action and plastic deformation between the foil and the material to which it is being welded. The scrubbing action displaces surface oxides and collapses asperities. This creates intimate metal-to-metal contact which results in solid-state welding. More information on UAM process details and applications can be found here: [https://smsl.osu.edu/uam/research](https://smsl.osu.edu/uam/research). The sonotrode rolls over the foil longitudinally (x-direction) to weld the layer. This scrubbing motion, however, is unable to produce good welds for interfaces that are normal to the x-y plane. Therefore, while robust parts and features can be built utilizing wide sheet feedstock, the edges of foil layers cannot be sufficiently welded to adjacent foils or base part material to fill channels or provide flush, seamless joints between parts without leaving cracks or weak areas in the build. This invention allows UAM to fill channels and gaps without leaving defects in the perpendicular plane.\n\nThe Technology\n\nThis invention uses UAM with a modified sonotrode to fill a channel that has been cut, formed, or otherwise created in a metal structure or between two metal structures. This technology utilizes standard foil feedstock without special processing or handling. The foil alloy may be the same or different than the part material and may be welded over reinforcing fibers, sensors, electronics, or other materials to embed them in the metal part. Multiple layers of metal foil can be welded into the channel until the entire channel is filled in. At this point, unwanted welded material can be removed using milling or other methods to achieve a flush surface where the channel once was. This invention enables the generation of strong, stable welds in channels required for joining structures or repairing damage and defects.\n\nCommercial Applications\n\n*   Aerospace structures: manufacturing, joining, or reinforcement of wings, fuselages, engine components, and supports\n*   Automotive structures: manufacturing, joining, or reinforcement of body structures and components such as seat frames\n*   Oil and gas: repair of pipeline cracks and damage or wear on drilling equipment\n*   Industrial processes: repair of wear and damage to expensive components\n*   Smart structures: embedment of sensors and electronics in aerospace, automotive, medical, and consumer products\n\nBenefits/Advantages\n\n*   Solid-state joining method\n*   High integrity welds without heat-affected zones or thermally induced stresses\n*   Applicable to a wide variety of metals and alloys\n*   Seamless, flush joints or repairs\n*   Minimal effect on the original temper of the parts and foil feedstock",

    "ip_description": "This invention proposes that an Optical Fiber-Based Gamma-Ray Calorimeter (OFBGC) sensor array can be designed, which does not require the distinct metallic thermal masses that are a part of the Optical Fiber-Based Gamma Thermometer (OFBGT). Researchers at The Ohio State University have created a state-of-the-art gamma thermometer in order to provide accurate power distribution measurements without the complications associated with LPRMs and TIPs. This invention proposes that an Optical Fiber-Based Gamma-Ray Calorimeter (OFBGC) sensor linear array (hereafter called simply an OFBGC) can be designed, which does not require the metallic masses found in other such devices. Within a single OFBGC, an optical fiber is used to measure the axial temperature distribution of an annular cylindrical thermal mass that has a low thermal conductivity, such as silica glass. The thermal mass has the geometrical form of a small diameter circular cylindrical tube, which extends the total axial length of the OFBGC. The hole within the tube has a diameter that is slightly larger than the diameter of an optical fiber. An optical fiber runs the length of the tube and is used to measure the temperature of the thermal mass along its length. The thermal mass is centered within a thin-walled metallic outer sheath. A gas gap fills the volume, between the thermal mass and outer sheath. The temperature of the outer sheath is measured along its length with an optical fiber based temperature sensor that is attached to the outer surface of the sheath. The response of the OFBGC is the temperature difference, which is measured between the two optical fiber based temperature sensors (the one that is within the thermal mass and the one that is attached to the outside of the outer sheath). This response can be measured for any axial position within the OFBGC array; i.e. at any axial height. This design is superior to current state of the art because 1) the number of sensors in the OFBGC sensor array is adjustable and limited only by the spatial resolution of the OFBGC sensors, and 2) the OFBGC sensor design is simpler to build than the other sensor arrays available. Unlike TIPS and LPRMS, it does not suffer sensitivity loss due burnup. Therefore, it can be a permanent installation in nuclear reactors which mitigates the risks associated with recalibrating LPRMs.",

Technology is advancing faster than ever, with major demand for instant communication and instant information among other industries. In order to facilitate this ever-growing industry, a technology called waveguides were invented. A waveguide confines the wave to propagate in one dimension, so that under ideal conditions, the wave loses no power while propagating. Due to total reflection at the walls, waves are confined to the interior of a waveguide. The complex nature of wave signals, and the countless technologies that often blend together multiple signals, makes it difficult to integrate the technologies. For example, the current state of the art waveguide modulators do not allow for microwave and optical waveguide crossings. The waveguide crossings are required for packaging the modulator with high-frequency co-axial connectors and with standard telecommunications wavelength optical fiber. There are several solutions to this problem but currently none of them produce efficient coupling, making them unable to be inserted into larger systems. Researchers at The Ohio State University have created a waveguide where the optical mode resides primarily in a lithium niobate rib waveguide, and the microwave mode resides primarily in the silicon substrate. Tuning of the layer thicknesses in the ion-sliced lithium niobate, silicon dioxide, and silicon substrate allow the microwave and optical group velocities to be designed with more flexibility. Consequently, velocity matching can be engineered more easily without reducing the electro-optical overlap. Optical waveguides can be etched with smooth sidewalls, allowing for minimal optical propagation losses and an efficient coupling.",

    "ip_name": "Variable Stiffness Robotic Gripper Based on Layer Jamming",
    "ip_number": "T2020-092",
    "published_date": "June 5, 2020",
    "ip_description": "A soft robotic gripper design which incorporates layer jamming as a means for creating tunable stiffness control and higher load capacities. Automation using robotics has taken many forms including, but not limited to, automotive manufacturing, transportation of good in shipping warehouses, and the delicate handling of wafers in semiconductor plants. In many of these applications grippers and end-of-arm-tools (EOAT\u2019s) are incorporated to allow robotic arms to complete specific tasks. Largely due to these considerations, Mckinsey & Company recently reported that grippers and EOAT\u2019s will grow from a $2.4 billion USD market in 2017 at a rate of 13-14% per annum to become a $5.1 billion USD market in 2023. Traditional rigid-body robotic grippers, however, consist of inflexible arms actuated by a large, unrestrained force. In this regard, damage to the product as well as danger to operators pose potential unwanted risks. Moreover, the rigid body nature of these grippers makes them less capable to handle items of unusual shapes, thereby limiting their applications. To address these concerns, some researchers have begun to develop soft robotic grippers which utilize a compliant structure and an actuating mechanism. Although much better suited for handling delicate and irregular objects, these soft grippers suffer from a limited loading capacity. In addition, many of these robotic grippers utilize complex designs and require expensive materials, thus reducing their feasibility as suitable alternatives. There is, therefore, a need for an easily implemented robotic gripper with tunable stiffness control for interacting with a wide variety of object geometries and materials. To address this need, researchers at The Ohio State University have developed a variable stiffness robotic gripper capable of reaching 30-40 times the load capacity of traditional soft/compliant robotic grippers. A main innovation of this design is the incorporation of a novel, compliant backbone to a vacuum layer-jamming system within the fingers of the gripper design. The compliant backbone possesses a series of branches which take-on a semi-elliptical shape and provide additional support to the vacuum-sealing bag that surrounds each finger. At their narrow end, these branches are attached to an elongated beam and at their wide end, these branches come in contact with a series of thin-layered sheets. Having the flexible beam located on the opposite side of the layered sheets enables a greater range of bending in the gripper\u2019s fingers. Tension cables run through the middle of the backbone branches and a servo-motor provides the rotational energy required to induce flexion and shape restoration in the gripper fingers. Alternative actuation method for shape flexion is via pneumatic network channels which are activated by pressured air. The layer-jamming system consists of a series of thin-layered sheets sealed within an airtight bag. When negative pressure is applied to the bag via a vacuum pump, the sheets are compressed together, creating a large friction force. This friction force restricts the motion of the sheets and holds the current shape of the system. By incorporating a vacuum layer-jamming technique into a compliant backbone, this novel gripper can adjust its stiffness for both stiff and soft materials. The final gripper design makes use of the stiffness control associated with vacuum layer jamming and a novel, easy-to-integrate backbone structure that minimizes stress concentrations and maximizes range of bending. Commercial Applications: Pick and place tasks such as sorting/packing in e-commerce automation lines, Sorting and packing of food and agricultural products, Automation of commercial kitchen and dining facilities, Manufacturing and automation lines in factories. Benefits/Advantages: Tunable stiffness for controlled load capacity, Able to handle soft and fragile irregular shaped objects, Inexpensive in fabrication, Safer interactions with human operators.",

    "ip_description": "A design of scalable laser-assisted MOCVD chamber for III-nitrides and other semiconductors with a laser array input. III-nitrides represent an important semiconductor material system for both optoelectronic and power electronic device applications. Advantages for III-nitrides include high electron saturation velocity, high critical electric field, high radiation resistance and decent thermal performance. Therefore, III-nitrides have attracted increasing interests in device applications. The fabrication of III-nitride films are mainly relied on epitaxy technology, including metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Low cracking efficiency of NH3 is one of the key challenges for III-nitride epitaxy, the limited N species at growth interface would affect the growth properties of III-nitride materials, such as growth rate, crystalline quality, impurities incorporation, native point defects generation and etc. These effects become more severe for materials grown at relatively low temperatures such as InN and InGaN. Therefore, methods for enhancing the cracking efficiency of NH3 are strongly needed for high quality and high efficient III-nitride epitaxy in MOCVD. Researchers at Ohio State are working to address this need, and have disclosed a design of scalable laser-assisted MOCVD chamber for III-nitrides and other semiconductors with a laser array input. The laser beam was distributed into an array before introducing to the growth chamber in order to form a uniform distribution of laser power for cracking N precursors in the entire chamber. This apparatus can be used for single or multiple wafer growth and for single or multiple layer growth. The same concept of laser-assisted MOCVD chamber design can be applied for systems for materials growth other than III-nitrides, such as III-V, III-oxides, group V, and II-VI.

    "ip_description": "An ensemble kamlan filter (EnKF) state observer algorithm and process monitoring method for more quickly and accurately estimating the internal temperature gradient of Powder Bed Fusion parts for enhanced process monitoring and control. Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) is a subset of additive manufacturing processes that performs a layer-by-layer fabrication of metal components by selectively melting metal powder disbursed over the earlier layer. PBF processes encompass methods such as selective laser sintering (SLS), direct metal laser sintering (DMLS), and electron beam melting (EBM). The market for PBF printers is expected to reach USD 1.85 billion by 2023 with a estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.1%. The market for PBF technologies is growing so quickly largely because PBF manufacturing can produce intricate parts in a variety of materials with superior mechanical properties to those manufactured by traditional methods. However, while their resultant strength may be higher, PBF parts tend to also display high levels of residual stresses, porosity, and anisotropy. These defects are the direct result of disparate cooling rates of the part as it is printed. In tandem with the high thermal gradient within the build chamber, the variable cooling rates create a temperature gradient within the part itself that influences its metallurgical phase formation, and in turn its mechanical properties. The high thermal stresses may also induce warping and heat-induced distortion of the part. Despite the importance of temperature control in PBF components, most PBF printers run without advanced process monitoring tools or feedback. While some infer cooling rates from temperature measurements of the melt pool, build chamber, or printer bed, all are limited to measuring surface temperature only, and methods estimating internal temperature accurately are needed to improve build success rates and component quality. Prof. David Hoelze and Graduate Research Associate Nathaniel Wood have developed a process-monitoring algorithm to estimate the internal temperatures of components manufactured through PBF in near-real time. The algorithm is a type of ensemble kamlan filter (EnKF), a subclass of state-observers that modifies a model of the internal temperature based on measurements of process inputs and outputs such as laser power and melt pool temperature. This approach forces the model's predictions to match the process realities thereby improving the model\u2019s accuracy. The inventors have adopted the EnKF to the realities of PBF, modifying its internal structure to accommodate uncertainty inherent in the PBF process inputs. Designed to work with the current generation of PBF printers, the algorithms' temperature field estimations offer comparable accuracy with a greatly reduced need for expansive training data sets relative to current methods. Accurate temperature predictions from the model allow a higher degree of process monitoring and control than previously available, such as near-real time fault detection and microstructure prediction during the manufacture of components. Commercial Applications: Signal processing tool for PBF system manufacturers, Quality control device for near-real time detection of faults and out-of-specification prints. Benefits: Near-real time modeling of internal temperature gradient, Adaptable to existing PBF printers, Comparably small amount of necessary calibration.",

CRISPR technology is an exciting tool for editing the genomes of live organisms. With CRISPR, researchers have replaced target genes with chosen alternative genes in species ranging from bacteria to live mice. The CRISPR system uses either the Cas9 or Cpf1 protein to bind a given DNA sequence and cleave it. The CRISPR/Cas9 system is the popular and widely used gold standard, but it suffers from some limitations relative to CRISPR/Cpf1. Cas9 requires two RNA molecules to activate DNA cleavage, whereas Cpf1 requires only one guide RNA (crRNA). Cleavage of DNA with Cas9 results in blunt ends, whereas Cpf1 produces sticky ends, the latter of which permits more specific genomic targeting.

    "ip_description": "A method for manufacturing surgical tools and implants with strong, gapless joints between NiTi (Nitinol) and stainless steel to capitalize on the best properties of both materials. NiTi (Nitinol) is widely accepted and used for medical devices such as surgical tools and implants due to its biocompatibility and unique thermal-mechanical properties which provide super-elastic or shape memory responses. However, there are currently no commercial solutions for joining of NiTi to other metals such as stainless steel (SS) without deterioration of the NiTi properties or the joint interface. This limits the ability to capitalize on the properties of different metals for different functions in medical devices. Current methods for mechanically joining NiTi and SS severely limit design freedom. Therefore, many surgical tools must be either all NiTi or all SS. According to a BCC Research report (HLC051H), Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques correspond to a $21-billion USD global market with a CAGR of 7.1% and estimated market size of $29.6-billion USD by 2024. Guidewires are one example of an MIS device for which no adequate method of joining NiTi and SS currently exists. As a result, current guidewires are made entirely from either SS or NiTi. SS tools are stiff enough to give the surgeon good control of the tool but the pigtail tip plastically deforms during insertion through the catheter, losing its optimal shape and risking damage to nearby tissue. Super-elastic NiTi tools provide an optimal shape after insertion through the catheter, but the flexibility of the shaft makes it difficult for the surgeon to control. Therefore, there is a need for a method to produce strong, gapless joints between NiTi and SS to capitalize on the advantages of both materials. For example, a pigtail guidewire with a SS shaft and NiTi pigtail tip would provide both good controllability and the safe, optimal shape of the inserted pigtail. Our team at The Ohio State University have developed a method to seamlessly join NiTi and SS using ultrasonic consolidation. This process produces solid-state welding of metals at low temperatures, preventing degradation of the NiTi properties while retaining the temper of the SS and providing robust, gapless joints. In order to overcome the limitations of current all-NiTi or all-SS cardiology pigtail guidewires, the team has developed a SS-NiTi guidewire with a SS shaft and a NiTi pigtail tip to provide both control and optimal tool shape after insertion. A NiTi wire is seamlessly embedded in the end of a SS shaft and extending out to form the tool. The NiTi tip can be shaped into any desired tool geometry, such as a pigtail. The inventors have reached the proof-of-concept stage with this technology and a provisional patent has been filed. The team is looking for a co-development partnership capable of helping them move the project forward into the next stages of design and execution. Commercial Applications: Tools for minimally invasive surgery, Medical implants, Robotic actuators, Deployable space structures.

    "ip_description": "Dysregulated fat metabolism is an established hallmark of cancer cells. However, the disruption of lipid homeostasis in cancer cells remains an elusive target for therapy. Tumor cells acquire abundant fats for rapid cell growth, but how they avoid toxicity from such loading is unknown. An answer to this question may allow leveraging of such insight to introduce a vulnerability to tumor cells and thus an effective strategy to treat cancer. Diacylglycerol-acyltransferase (DGAT) regulates the final and committed step for triglyceride synthesis. There are two known isoforms of the enzyme, DGAT 1 and DGAT 2. Due to their well-established role in lipid metabolism, several isoform-specific inhibitors have been the focus of industry sponsored clinical pipelines for various metabolic diseases, such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver disease. However, the effects of DGAT inhibition in various cancer types are poorly understood. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Deliang Guo, have discovered a novel therapeutic strategy targeting DGAT in cancer. They have demonstrated DGAT plays a critical role in regulating lipid homeostasis and protecting cancer cells from oxidative damage induced by excess fatty acids. DGAT isoforms are differentially regulated in different cancer types, and inhibiting DGAT induces dramatic cell apoptosis and reduction of tumor growth _in vitro_ and _in vivo_. Importantly, examination of patient samples demonstrated high levels of DGAT are associated with poor patient survival.

    "ip_description": "A control method based upon properties of linear systems to manipulate the vibrational amplitudes and frequencies of structural systems by exploiting piecewise-linear (PWL) nonlinearities. Energy harvesting from system vibrations is considered a promising green energy source with the capacity to both self-power small-scale devices and fulfill the need of large-scale electricity generation. A recent report by BCC research found that the markets for Vibration, Displacement, and Mechanical energy harvesters reached a total, global size of $500 million USD in 2018 with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.5% through 2023. Vibration energy harvesting can be realized using piezoelectric, electromagnetic, or electrostatic approaches. Early designs of these power generators were based on linear models that provide the maximum power generation efficiency at resonance with their efficiency decreasing dramatically even when the excitation frequency shifts slightly. Thus, traditional linear energy harvesters are usually limited to very narrow frequency ranges. To address this shortcoming, a variety of nonlinear energy harvesters have been proposed to broaden the frequency range; none of them, however, are as effective as linear energy harvesters operating at resonance. A class of nonlinear energy harvesters with piecewise-linear (PWL) nonlinearities have been proposed, but proper analysis and control of these systems has been a challenge. These PWL energy harvesters usually incorporate a mechanical stopper into system designs such that the effective frequency range can be broadened by the contact nonlinearity between the main oscillator and the stopper. However, these systems do not generally provide the optimized power generation efficiency at an arbitrary excitation frequency. An adjustable PWL system that adjusts based on the excitation frequency would enable optimal energy extraction over a large frequency range. Researcher\u2019s at The Ohio State University\u2019s Nonlinear Dynamics and Vibration Lab addressed this need by devising a new technique that includes a mechanical system and a control method to optimize the vibration performance of energy harvesters. The new designs incorporate mechanical stoppers or additional sets of springs and dampers into traditional linear systems. The resonant frequencies and amplitude of these systems can then be manipulated by adjusting the gap size or prestress between mechanical elements. The benefit of utilizing PWL nonlinearity in these systems is that a wide frequency range can be covered by shifting the resonant frequency by actively controlling the gap size or prestress in these systems while maintaining the high performance of a linear system at resonance. The advantages of this technique and associated data were published in Proceedings A of The Royal Society Publishing journal on January 1 2020 (Volume 476, Issue 2233). Commercial Applications: Powering of remote sensors by harvesting the system\u2019s vibrations, Energy harvesting devices to feed the power grid. Benefits/Advantages: Improved energy extraction capability and efficiency, Applicable to a wide range of excitation frequency and amplitude, Computational efficiency suitable for complex mechanical designs, Compatible with systems which contain gaps or prestress. Research Interests: The Nonlinear Dynamics and Vibration Laboratory that developed this technology has expertise in the analysis and study of systems exhibiting nonlinear dynamics covering a wide variety of fields and applications, including: studying piecewise linear nonlinear systems; design of vibration absorbers; structural health monitoring for nonlinear systems; sensing using vibration based methods; forecasting bifurcations in nonlinear systems; creating tools for modeling and analyzing high dimensional cyclic structures such as those found in gas turbine engines, and; full scale rotating experiments of bladed disks.",

    "ip_description": "Liposome drug delivery systems play a significant role in the formulation of new therapies. These liposome-encapsulated drugs are used to treat a wide range of diseases such as cancer, influenza, and hepatitis. While endogenous liposomes are recognized by the mononuclear phagocyte system and cleared from the blood stream, the development of high-stability, long-circulating liposomes (i.e. \u2018stealth liposomes\u2019) was a substantial improvement in lipid-based drug delivery technology. This improvement emerged from using lipids of the liposome membrane to anchor polyethylene glycol (PEG) compounds by a single covalent bond to the liposome surface. Used in this way, the presence of PEG prevents serum protein from binding to the liposome and precipitating immunoclearance. However, all PEG-incorporated stealth liposome technologies have a practical weakness: they cannot tolerate dehydration and therefore cannot tolerate anhydrous storage. Therefore, the state of liposome drug delivery technology would be improved by a technology that performs at least as well as PEG-dependent technology and also addresses this fundamental flaw.\n\nResearchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Dennis Bong, have developed a new variety of stealth liposome technology that uses sugar-based polymers rather than PEG. These sugar-based polymers provide stability to liposomes during anhydrous storage, therefore addressing the flaw of PEG-dependent stealth liposomes. This increased stability occurs because each sugar-based polymer binds numerous lipid anchors of the liposome membrane, as opposed to PEG\u2019s single bond. This cross-linking results in a highly-branched structure that is substantially more-stable than is possible using PEG-dependent technology. Additionally, relative to currently-used, PEG-dependent stealth liposomes, this new sugar-based polymer technology both elicits less immunoactivity from the mononuclear phagocyte system and also has an increased period of circulation.\n\nCommercial Applications\n* Improvement to liposome-based drug delivery systems\n* Minimizing the immune-footprint of stealth liposome technology\n\nBenefits/Advantages\n* While currently-used PEG-dependent stealth liposomes are unstable in dry storage, this new stealth liposome technology uses sugar-based polymers to provide stability during dry storage\n* New stealth liposomes that incorporate sugar-based polymers have a longer period of circulation for effective drug delivery versus PEG technology.",

    "ip_number": "T2020-054",
    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "A lightweight power module that reduces loop stray inductance while maintaining good electrical insulation and thermal dissipation. In conventional power module structures, the die is attached to the substrate, usually direct bonding copper (DBC). The ceramic substrate layer provides electrical insulation between the circuit and cooling structure and attaches to a conductive baseplate material (Cu, Al, AlSiC) to dissipate heat. In this conventional configuration, the power loop stray inductance is large so the layered structure from semiconductor dies to the heatsink results in relatively high thermal resistance. The voltage overshoot and oscillation results from the stored energy in the stray inductance of the power loop. Under high current and high-speed switching, voltage overshoot requires sufficient voltage margins of the power devices. Higher voltage rating devices result in additional cost, higher conduction losses, and lower overall efficiency. Thus, the power loop inductance reduction is critical for high switching speed high-efficiency operation with low overshoot voltage. By decreasing the effective power loop area, the power loop inductance can be reduced. Thus, there is a need for a power module design that reduces inductance resulting in a reduced need for heat dissipation which will increase the power density of the module and reduce the overall weight. Xintong Lyu has developed a novel design for power modules which reduces inductance and voltage overshoot. This is accomplished by utilizing a vertical loop with a half-bridge structure with integrated decoupling capacitors. The new layout can fully utilize the conducting area on the substrate. This technology can be easily paralleled for a high current rating power module. Multi-chip paralleling of this basic unit provides symmetrical loop inductance among the dies and eliminates the imbalanced current sharing problem brought by packaging. When implementing the vertical loop design, the bottom conduction layer of the substrate conducts current and experiences voltage potential. This technology also features a novel cooling structure to dissipate this heat from the substrate.",

    "ip_description": "The potential of different materials for vertical power switching is often assessed by calculating the Baliga Figure of Merit (BFOM). In the case of wide and ultra-wide bandgap materials, the high breakdown fields and the relatively good transport properties make the BFOM significantly higher than conventional Si electronics. However, the breakdown field predicted for a material requires that the entire bandgap be presented across the rectifying junction, such as in a PN junction. This is challenging to achieve in several wide bandgap materials where bipolar doping is not available or presents technological challenges. Schottky junctions can provide excellent rectification but the reverse breakdown of Schottky rectifiers is limited by the Schottky barrier height, which is significantly lower than the bandgap in most wide bandgap semiconductors. Thus, there is a need for an approach that can enable field management so that high breakdown fields can be achieved even in unipolar junctions.\n\nA team of researchers at The Ohio State University led by Dr. Siddharth Rajan has developed a method of dielectric heterojunction engineering comprising of a lightly doped n-type or p-type semiconductor drift layer and a high-k material with a dielectric constant that is at least 2 times higher than the value of the semiconductor drift layer. Metal Schottky contact is formed on the high-k material and metal Ohmic contact is formed on the lightly doped semiconductor. Under reversed bias, the dielectric constant discontinuity leads to a very low electric field in the low-k semiconductor drift layer. The electron barrier created by high-k material stays almost flat. Therefore, the dielectric heterojunction maintains a barrier to electron or hole tunneling at much higher voltages than the metal/semiconductor junction. Under forward bias, electrons flow from the semiconductor, through the high dielectric constant layer, into the metal. For small values of conduction band offset or valence band offset between the high-k and low-k material, dielectric heterojunction is expected to support efficient electron or hole transport.\n\nCommercialization\n*   Photodetectors\n*   Power electronics\n\nBenefits\n*   High k dielectric junction enables high breakdown field (5.7 MV/cm)\n*   Higher reliability\n*   Lower on-resistance for power electronics",

    "ip_description": "Professor Krishnaswamy Strinivasan and PhD candidate Kirti Mishra have developed a method for automatically calibrating gearshift controllers for automatic transmissions. In the first instance, the method applies to the initial stage of transmission calibration, where a calibration engineer typical spends a large amount of working hours adjusting and tuning gearshift control parameters as part of the overall development of a new transmission. After development, the method also works during the regular operation of the vehicle, adapting control parameters over time as transmission characteristics change due to wear and tear. The method uses iterative learning to adapt control inputs for the next gearshift based on readings from the previous shift, and a linear varying control technique for feedback control during discrete phases of the shift. Once provided with an appropriate feasible region on the speed-torque plane for all legal gearshifts, the algorithm converts the region into a calibration grid. At every point on the grid an initial condition involving a rough estimate of the desired control parameter is then modified overtime through discrete iterations until the transmission is calibrated. A separate algorithm is used for adaption of gearshift control parameters in the transmission controller during regular operation of the vehicle. In general, the algorithm adjusts control parameters in real-time so that the parameter, be it fill time or torque value always fall within the desired range. This accounts for production differences from one transmission to another and for expected changes over time due to wear and tear. For instance, during the fill phase online algorithm chooses when to initiate the fill operation for the oncoming clutch by varying what percent decrease in turbine acceleration is sufficient to initiate a gearshift until the fill time falls within the desired tolerances.",

    "ip_description": "A method of authenticating an IC die\u2019s origin and uniquely identifying each die with an intrinsic unclonable value through measurement of on-chip capacitance values. Hardware security in Integrated Circuit (IC) designs is of increasing importance in dealing with the insecure, expanding global supply chain of these parts. The ability to trace the origin of a die, combined with the capability to uniquely identify each die provides valuable quantitative measures of trust in the device\u2019s proper operation and performance. Additionally, self-detection of IC die tampering and/or malicious circuit insertions (e.g. Trojans) provides a continuous measure of hardware trust throughout a device\u2019s operation in an uncontrolled environment. Some current practices in hardware security rely on expensive top layer protective coatings of randomly distributed conductive particles within a dielectric material to encapsulate a die. These randomly distributed conductive particles form unique capacitances, which are measured by the underlying die to form a unique, unpredictable identification value. Any attempts to cut through this protective top layer to modify the die underneath will alter the capacitances and therefore the identification value. While this method helps to prevent malicious insertions or modifications after die fabrication and encapsulation, it does not provide any information on the origin fabrication facility nor does its unique identification rely on the traditional process steps of IC fabrication. Other practices utilize single-bit, differential measurement of capacitances formed through the special layout of metal lines within the top metal layers of the die. These practices are impractical due to the extremely unwieldy area overhead in the metal layer routing and the lack of security in single-bit, differential outputs. This method does not provide any trace to the origin of the die fabrication nor does it reveal the presence of circuit tampering during the original fabrication of each device. Circuit tampering attempts made after die fabrication are only detected if the tampering happens to reverse the polarity of the differential capacitance measurement. Thus, many alterations would remain undetected. A team of researchers at The Ohio State University led by Dr. Waleed Khalil has developed a method of authenticating each die\u2019s origin and uniquely identifying each die with an intrinsic unclonable value through measurement of on-chip capacitance values. Each foundry has a specific process flow that results in different distributions of capacitance formed as a result of power supply and interconnect metal layer routing. These capacitive distributions coupled with the resistive leakage from these lines relay foundry-specific information. This information can then be used to authenticate the origin of a particular IC after fabrication, without relying on any process control monitoring data or die marcation. All foundry processes also have uncontrollable random variations that manifest themselves as differing values of capacitance within the metal routing on the die. Measuring these capacitance values and the resistive leakage from these lines provides a unique, unclonable identification for each die. The unique die identification can be used to prevent overproduction and black market sales of ICs. Benefits include: Can authenticate a die\u2019s origin, Can uniquely identify each die with an intrinsic unclonable value, Can detect malicious tampering with back-end-of-line (BEOL) processing steps.",

At present, given the limited capabilities of autonomous vehicles, it is necessary for the driver to monitor the vehicle and take over driving in a split second. One way for the vehicle to recognize that the driver can take over control of the vehicle is to determine if the driver has his or her hands on the steering wheel. The location of the hands is also important to determine how attentive the driver is.\n\nThe primary hand sensor on the market is based on a capacitive sensor system similar to the sensor currently used in touchscreens. The disadvantage of this approach is that the sensitivity of the system is dependent on the electrical characteristics of the hand which may vary with individuals and even vary with a single individual based on the environment (e.g. dry versus humid). Also, if the driver is wearing gloves, the capacitive sensor may not work well.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "The quantum well design is incorporated within a red-emitting InGaN QW LED, an LED type that usually cannot efficiently emit wavelengths larger than blue/green. The LED can be incorporated into a same-material RGB platform for white LEDs, because the well design increases efficiency and decreases indium composition compared to similar wavelength InGaN LEDs.\n\nThe Need\n\nBlue-emitting InGaN quantum well (QW) LEDs now have 69% external quantum efficiency, but increasing the emitted-wavelength decreases the efficiency significantly. The inversion asymmetry of the InGaN lattice increases the induced strain, which in turn increases the piezoelectric effect. Charge builds in the QW, inducing an electrical field, which causes the QW to no longer produce discrete sublevels. Multiple wavelengths of photons are emitted, instead of just one. The emitted light is less intense at one wavelength and more electrical current must be passed through the QW to recombine holes and electrons at the same rate.\n\nRed-emitting InGaN QW LEDs are not only inefficient, but to reach a red wavelength, the composition of indium must be increased. Indium often comes in a low quality material with a high number of defects. Research to increase efficiency has focused on using less polar InGaN, staggering InGaN QW, strain-compensating with InGaN/AlGaN QW, using type-II InGaN/GaNAs QW, and using InGaN-\u0394-InN QW. A same-material RGB platform for white LEDs is commercially impractical for conventional InGaN QW LEDs.\n\nLED platforms are used in electronic devices and screens such as mobile phones, tablets, TVs, computers, computer monitors, watches and even streetlamps and vehicle headlights. Inefficient emission at longer wavelengths limits the color combinations of the electronic screens, depletes battery life, or decreases the lifetime of the LED due to charge build up. For white LEDs without an RGB platform, light is produced using phosphor. Small changes in the phosphor layer drastically changes the color temperature of the light. Most white LEDs using phosphor have a cool color temperature which constricts the pupil and hurts eyesight.\n\nThe Technology\n\nResearchers at the Ohio State University, led by Dr. Hongping Zhao have developed novel QWs for light emission beyond the blue and green spectra. The QW has layers of InGaN, ZnSnN2, and AlGaN to increase lattice-matching and hole-electron recombination of the red-emitting LED. The layering has better hole and electron confinement but with increased electron-hole wave function overlap. As a result, the holes and electrons can recombine more efficiently and the QW sublevels remain discrete. The InGaN QW LED can efficiently emit red light (685 nm) with a higher intensity and lower indium composition.\n\nCommercial Applications\n\n*   Red InGaN QW LEDs\n*   Same-material InGaN QW RGB platforms for white LEDs\n*   Personal electronics and displays: mobile phones, tablets, TVs, computers, computer screens, watches\n*   Household and commercial buildings: interior and exterior lighting\n*   Automotive: Headlights, taillights, dashboards/consoles, HUDs, accent lighting.\n\nBenefits/Advantages\n\n*   Higher efficiency\n*   Higher intensity\n*   Increased wavelength range for InGaN QW LED platforms\n*   Same-material RGB InGaN QW platform\n*   RGB platform can emit white light without phosphor",

Verticillins, which are epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) alkaloids, have shown promising anticancer qualities; these fungal metabolites have exhibited high potency against a variety of tumor cell types, with IC50 values typically in the 10-500 nanomolar range. However, these compounds suffer from poor drug-like properties, including low solubility and stability, which make difficult application for in vivo experimentation and administration. Efforts to synthesize ETPs have resulted in compounds lacking key \u2013OH moieties.

    "ip_description": "The vitreous humor is a fragile, transparent tissue between the lens and the retina of the eye that maintains the shape of the eye, acts as a shock absorber, and enables nutrient diffusion to ocular tissues. The vitreous also plays a key role in oxygen homeostasis. Over time, the vitreous degrades, which compromises its function. Currently, people may undergo a vitrectomy operation that removes the vitreous and replaces the vitreous with silicone oil. This disrupts oxygen homeostasis, which may lead to cataracts, and may require the patent to lie face down for weeks to avoid retinal damage. Other corrective measures pose the same risk, and researchers have not previously found substitutes to solve this issue. Since the FDA has not approved a substitute since 1994, there is a need for a safe vitreous substitute.\n\nOhio State researcher Dr. Katelyn Swindle-Reilly and her team have created a vitreous substitute composed of copolymeric hydrogels that have similar properties as the natural vitreous humor. The hydrogel is an injectable substance that is used after vitreoretinal surgery. This hydrogel has the potential to eliminate the need for postoperative patient compliance. Therapeutics have been loaded in the hydrogel to prevent post-surgical cataract.\n\nCommercial Applications\n* Ophthalmology\n* Surgical operations for retinal diseases\n\nBenefits/Advantages\n* Similar properties as the natural vitreous humor\n* Eliminates need for postoperative patient compliance\n* Decreases postoperative occurrences of cataracts\n\nResearch Interests\nThe Ohio State University laboratory that developed this technology has expertise in the design of polymeric biomaterials for soft tissue repair and drug delivery with focused applications in ophthalmology and wound healing.

    "ip_description": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, resulting in more than 600,000 deaths and a significant contributor to overall healthcare costs. Over 28 million Americans are diagnosed with heart disease and contribute more than $30 billion in healthcare-related expenses. The gradual buildup of cholesterol and minerals (plaques), or atherosclerosis, are hallmark characteristics of the condition for which arteries become occluded, leading to myocardial infarction, or heart attack.\n\n**The Need**\nAround 3.2 million stent procedures are performed annually worldwide to treat cardiovascular diseases. However, up to 50% of the reconstructed vessels, particularly those in the periphery, fail due to re-narrowing, or restenosis. Current anti-restenotic treatments with drug-eluting stents do not completely prevent restenosis and worsen thrombogenic risks that can eventually lead to the occlusion of the artery. Therefore, new therapeutic options are needed to eliminate plaques without the ill effects of stenting.\n\n**The Technology**\nThis technology describes an intravenous drug delivery system that uses polymer-based nanoclusters for treating restenosis. The nanoclusters are coated with platelet membranes that make the nanoparticle water soluble, target the plaque, and encompass a drug to eliminate restenosis. The inventors have created a prototype of the delivery system and tested it within an animal model of atherosclerosis.\n\nTreatment with the nanoclusters led to a preferential accumulation of nanoparticles in the injured vessels and a 60% decrease in neointimal hyperplasia, the primary cause of restenosis. Additionally, nanoparticles loaded with compounds such as JQ1 or PERK inhibitor produced superior results to the gold standard compound for drug-eluting stents, rapamycin.\n\n**Commercial Applications**\n*   Targeted delivery of endothelium-protective anti-restenotic therapeutics.\n\n**Benefits/Advantages**\n*   Stent-free\n    *   Lower cost\n    *   Less trauma & side effects\n    *   May more effectively reduce restenosis\n*   IV injection-compatible\n*   Personalized regimen\n*   Reduced need for secondary invasive interventions",

    "ip_description": "A novel acoustic/ultrasonic wave-energy guiding system that utilizes structural topology to enhance directional and spectral sensitivities instead of phase delay, offering exceptional versatility and adaptable performance. Although acoustic beamforming systems that are based on phase delays can be used to enhance directional and spectral sensitivities, each source or receiver must be individually controlled by appropriate phase delays to guide the acoustic energy radiation/reception sensitivities. This results in a massive computational burden in order to realize intense confinement of acoustic waves in angular regions or to achieve focusing at specific spatial locations, particularly at high frequencies. The spatial distribution in such systems may also result in physically large platforms. There is a need for a wave-energy guiding system with high sensitivity, reduced implementation complexity, substantially reduced computational burden and increased compactness and deployability. Ryan Harne at Ohio State University has developed a wave-energy guiding system that provides an alternative to phase delay technology by utilizing structural topology to enhance directional and spectral sensitivities. These origami-based engineering design techniques provide exceptional versatility and adaptable performance resulting in systems that can be made compact and selectively deployable. Origami-type folded structures provide periodic patterns of planar facets and acoustic arrays are composed of electromechanical transducers positioned on the planar elements, all of which are together driven by one or a few signals. Simple kinematic and mechanical transformations of this folding array topology can therefore govern the directional and spectral sensitivities for wave energy guiding and steering, in contrast to a multitude of individually controlled signals sent/received from a spatially-fixed, conventional array of acoustic sources/receivers. The Harne system further includes actuation mechanisms to controllably fold and unfold the structural substrate to provide tunable changes in functionality. Benefits/Advantages: Spatial and spectral sensitivities can be tuned and steered by simple reconfigurations of the foldable transducer array; Tremendous wave energy may be strategically concentrated; For 'Miura-ori'-type folding cells, 38 dB increase in radiated acoustic pressure at broadside location with 20\u00b0 change in folding angle - a 10,000 times increase in acoustic power; Only a single 'drive' signal is required to actuate all of the transducer elements positioned on each of the planar facets; Facet angle and/or voltage can be adjusted by feedback module during operation until performance output matches the desired performance output; Completely foldable for easy storage and/or transportation; Uses compliant, folded materials (e.g. cardstock; polypropylene; polyethylene).",

Obesity remains one of the main underlying causes for many malignancies in domestic animals such as cats, dogs, and horses. From a veterinary perspective, obesity dramatically increases the risk of cancer, one of the leading causes of death in domesticated animals. Other diseases correlated with obesity include cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes. Existing lifestyle and diet options for obesity and metabolic disorder treatment are generally met with varying levels of compliance and success. Current surgical strategies carry risk of intra-operative and post-operative complications. Thus, there is need for innovative, minimally-invasive solutions for treating obesity in animals. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Ouilana Ziouzenkova have developed a strategy for implanting allogeneic thermogenic cells as a treatment for metabolic disorders and obesity. Increasing the proportion of thermogenic cells has been shown to reduce weight and increase insulin sensitivity. The researchers have demonstrated this technique both _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ in mice_,_ confirming its ability to successfully increase the basal metabolic rate and increase fat burning in animal tissue. Importantly, the length and intensity of treatment can be modified via the use of these engineered cells. Moreover, the use of biocompatible polymers for encapsulation of the cells avoids a combative immune response from the treated animals. This non-invasive approach can avoid potential complications associated with surgical procedures and offers more consistency than lifestyle modifications. Commercial Applications: Treatment of animal metabolic disorders including: Obesity, Blood sugar malignancies (i.e. hyperglycemia and diabetes), Inflammatory diseases, Cardiovascular disease, Obesity-related cancers.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in individuals 65 and older and is the third leading cause of blindness worldwide. Wet AMD is characterized by abnormal growth of leaky blood vessels leading to damage to the macula of the retina resulting in vision loss and permanent legal blindness. Once the blood vessels bleed and scar due to their fragile structure, it will bring irreversible damage to the photoreceptors and retina. For current treatment, monthly intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF such as bevacizumab and ranibizumab are given by an ophthalmologist to block VEGF from initiating angiogenesis. However, frequent injections may lead to infection, elevated intraocular pressure and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Moreover, the current treatment has resulted in poor patient compliance and increased medical costs due to the side effects associated with the treatment.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "A kit that lay individuals or healthcare practitioners can use on a tablet or other mobile device to evaluate visual field loss using a rapid, self-administered test. Individuals with diseases affecting the eye or brain are susceptible to losing parts of their visual field of view. The loss can be central (e.g. AMD), peripheral (e.g. glaucoma) or sectoral (e.g. stroke). Although there are therapy options to address such visual field loss, compromised vision can go undiagnosed for long periods of time, allowing substantial progression of disease and field loss before detection and treatment. A contributing factor to this neglect is that individuals may have compromised vision in one eye with an intact visual field at the same area in the contralateral eye. The normal eye can therefore mask or accommodate the condition. Eye doctors often routinely measure the extent, if any, of a patient's visual field loss to make diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. However, conventional protocols for such measurements typically require complex instrumentation and are performed by trained professionals at a doctor's office. Thus, there is a substantial need for an accurate screening device and procedure for rapid visual field assessment that does not necessitate a visit to the doctor's office, employs simple instrumentation such as a mobile device, and can be self-administered. Dr. Teng Leng Ooi, a researcher at the Ohio State University College of Optometry, has created a technology that can be used by a patient or healthcare practitioner to assess visual field defects quickly and accurately at home or in clinic. The testing kit consists of a software program that can be readily downloaded to a laptop, tablet or other mobile device along with inexpensive eyewear providing either colorized or polarizing lenses for each eye. The system concurrently presents dissimilar visual scenes to each eye. Areas of visual field loss or defects are immediately recognizable on the display and can be marked or outlined on the screen by the individual using a standard hand-held pointing device. This marked-up field map can then be stored and printed or emailed to a healthcare practitioner. Proof of concept for this technology in human subjects has been achieved including on-same-screen comparison with data from parallel testing with the gold standard Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer. Commercial Applications: Rapid, accurate and inexpensive at-home detection/monitoring of visual field loss or defects, Can augment or, for certain purposes, replace existing in-clinic visual field testing protocols/practices, Highly portable for use in varied locations (e.g., drug stores, nursing homes). Benefits/Advantages: No complex instrumentation and easily self-administered by lay individuals, Affordable package (software, eyewear) designed for operation on laptops, tablets, smartphones, Simultaneously and rapidly (in seconds) assesses all regions of an individual's field of vision, Clear presentation of areas of field loss easily apparent to user, Loss or defect areas can be marked up by user with a standard input drawing pen for storage and transmission to healthcare provider if desired.",

    "ip_description": "A novel battery anode designed to overcome the limitations posed on fast charge batteries by graphite anodes. The new anode increases battery life, is more stable during manufacturing, and has improved heat dissipation qualities. The Need: As technology continues to progress, embedding itself in our daily life from our cars to our wrists, an ever-present concern is the need for batteries with the ability to re-charge quickly. Most of these emerging technologies use Li-ion batteries with graphite anodes. Unfortunately, under fast charge the graphite anodes have a tendency to deteriorate due to the lithium electrolyte. While teams are exploring alternate battery compositions and designs, an alternate anode that could be used in Li-ion batteries could solve the problem now for all of these existing technologies while simultaneously opening the door for future advancements. The Technology: A research team at The Ohio State University led by Dr. Anne Co have developed a battery anode whose unique structure and composition enables it to fast charge without the usual associated drawbacks of fast charge on a graphite anode. The anode, composed largely of transition metals, has improved heat dissipation capabilities and can maintain graphite\u2019s low voltage capability, but with no observable Li dendrite growth. It does all of this without being sensitive to the air during the manufacturing process. By maintaining stable temperatures the anode retains its structure during fast charge cycles, making it a marked improvement, even over state of the art fast charge graphite anodes. Full-cell performance of the anode with a commercial LiFePO4 cathode at 6C charge/discharge (10 min charge/discharge)) delivered a capacity of 75 mAhr/g, and could sustain 13 mAhr/g at 60C at an impressive charge/discharge within 1 min for up to 3000 cycles.

    "ip_description": "A simple, inexpensive device for redirecting nasal airflow for individuals complaining of nasal obstruction. Nasal sinus disease is one of the most common medical conditions in the U.S., affecting an estimated 13% of the adult population and accounting for 12.5 million physician office visits annually. Among its many symptoms, complaints of nasal obstruction is one of the primary symptoms that most significantly impacts a patient's quality of life. However, it is well known that an individual's perception of nasal obstruction often does not correlate with their actual nasal resistance and could be due to a disoriented nasal airflow pattern. Therefore, a simple device to redirect nasal airflow could provide substantial symptomatic relief in this patient population. Currently available nasal plugs do not address the issue of disoriented nasal airflow patterns because they are designed solely to prop open or dilate the nostrils. An exemplary nasal dilator includes two rigid cylindrical rings connected by a bridge. Each ring may, in fact, open the nasal passage to allow more airflow but the airflow is non-directional. Dr. Kai Zhao at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center has designed a simple, inexpensive nasal plug with embedded tubes for redirecting airflow into a person's nasal passage. These plugs address prominent symptoms of pathologies such as 'empty nose syndrome' and turbinate hypertrophy. Essentially, the problem being addressed is that some people's nasal airflow patterns are moderately to severely misdirected. For example, the airflow may form a narrow jet directed toward the middle meatus. The Zhao nasal plug redirects the nasal flow in these patients to the lower meatus, mimicking normal airflow patterns. However, beyond patient's suffering from the above pathologies, initial clinical studies suggest that the plugs can provide symptomatic relief to a wide variety of individuals with nasal sinus complaints. These studies allowed patients to adjust the rotatable plug/tube system to the orientation providing the best sensation of airflow and prompted comments like: 'I cannot believe how much these things return the sensation of air.' While the plugs may be custom made based on a CT scan of the nasal cavity, it is envisioned that they will also be made available for fast, over-the-counter access at drug stores and other commercial outlets. Commercial Applications: Inexpensive, over-the-counter plug kit for symptomatic relief for individuals with nasal sinus complaints; Custom-made plugs for patients with nasal pathologies such as 'empty nose syndrome'.

    "ip_description": "An integrated system to improve the quality of analysis of the resected tumor specimen that provides the pathologist with the latest technological and scientific advancements. In the field of cancer pathology, the identification and sampling of tumors is essential for both surgical applications and treatment plans for patients that may include post-operative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Currently pathologists and pathologist assistants rely on visual and tactile cues to identify and locate tumors in resected tissues. The proper identification and processing of a tissue specimen is crucial as inaccuracies in tumor processing may result in errors in pathological diagnoses and reduce treatment efficacy. Currently pathologists are limited to two-dimensional views of potentially malignant tissue in the operating room, which reduces their ability to identify the number of tumors, orientation, and the relationship to the nearest surgical margin of resection. Technologies with the ability to provide a three-dimensional view in the operating room may greatly improve tumor identification and sampling thereby improving surgical outcomes and providing guidance for post-surgical treatment plans. A team of multi-disciplinary researchers at The Ohio State University developed a system that provides a real-time augmented visual to accurately guide a surgeon to cancerous tumors. The system incorporates a 'Wearable Augmented Reality' device with a stereo electro-optical camera to create an overlapping field-of-view. A gamma camera and CT scanners provide the locations of lymphatic and cancerous tissues. A 'pathology locator wand' provides a pinpoint accuracy of the cancerous tissue, which will reduce the possibility of accidentally removing healthy tissue. The combination of the 'Wearable Augmented Reality' with the 'pathology locator wand' will provide pathologists with a 3-dimensional view of tumors, which represents the novel advantage of this technology.

    "ip_description": "A modular and non-invasive ECVT sensor that can be adapted and scaled to vessel demands. Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (ECVT) is a non-invasive image reconstruction that provides volumetric images of a material. An ECVT system is generally comprised of a sensor, data acquisition system, computer system, and software for reconstruction of the 3D image. Capacitance data collected from the electrodes or plates placed around or near the region of interest are used to achieve the image reconstruction. In ECVT, sensor plates are generally distributed around the circumference or along the edge of a vessel under interrogation. If the plates are along the outside of the vessel, the vessel itself should not be an electrical conductor in order for the electric field to penetrate the region of interest. This presents a challenge in high pressure and high temperature applications, where such high-pressure high temperature vessels are usually made of steel or other electrical conductors. Researchers at The Ohio State University, have developed a novel, non-invasive ECVT sensor that operates in harsh environments allowing for measurements of high pressure flow systems. The general design consists of capacitance plates arranged on the inner surface of a high-strength vessel held in place by bolts. This arrangement allows the force to be transmitted from the capacitance plates to the outer high-strength vessel. Each capacitance plate is electrically connected to a data collection unit via the bolt that affixes the capacitance plate. The capacitance plate is coated on the fluid side with a dielectric material which allows for the formation of a capacitor for ECVT measurements and can withstand high temperature, highly abrasive, and highly corrosive conditions. Examples of materials used for the coating include ceramics and high temperature plastics. The device has been designed to be entirely modular so that components are easily replaced.

    "ip_description": "An improved delivery mechanism has been developed for hydrophobic drugs such as camptothecin which will increase chemotherapeutic efficacy. Many cancer therapeutics exhibit extremely toxic side effects or have limited efficacy due to low bio-availability. Existing drug delivery technologies can add excessive mass to the therapeutic, grossly expanding the dosage necessary for response. Camptothecin (CPT) is a naturally occurring compound which has chemotherapeutic applications. However, clinical trials utilizing CPT are limited by several of the compound's properties. CPT is highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and is hydrolytically unstable in blood due to its affinity to bind to the human serum protein albumin, which increases equilibrium concentration of the toxic carboxylate form. CPT is poorly absorbed by cancerous cells after oral or intravenous ingestion, which means that large doses must be administered with deleterious side effects for the patient. To optimize CPT's chemotherapeutic effects on cancerous cells and minimize these negative, synthetic CPT derivatives must circumvent such molecular behaviors of unmodified CPT. Dr. Parquette and his team of researchers at The Ohio State University developed a novel method in which peptides self-assemble into well-defined nanotubes and nanofibers. CPT-peptide assemblies tested in vitro were more effective at killing human colorectal cancer cells than clinically used Irinotecan drug, at lower concentrations. Improved water solubility for intravenous clinical treatments. Greater lactone stability and decreased cytotoxicity in comparison to unmodified CPT.

    "ip_description": "A foam collector to be used with bioreactors that would target and remove secondary metabolites produced and held within foam that is a product of the chemical reactions conducted. Certain chemical reactions conducted in bioreactors, like aerobic fermentation, can produce a persistent foam that fills the headspace of the reactor vessels in which the reaction is taking place. This foam can be removed by introducing surface agents, but this is extremely undesirable as these agents can be deleterious to the products and will need to be removed before product isolation. Further, certain metabolites only present during short periods of time can be partitioned into the foam. These intermittent metabolites, if not collected, are typically degraded later on in the reaction by other enzymes produced by the reaction. So, a method for collecting the foam and subsequently analyzing and isolating the secondary metabolites is needed. This technology is a novel foam collector to be used with bioreactors. Currently, the presence of the foam is taught to be avoided in all chemical reactions. However, this technology promotes the production of the persistent foam. Once the foam is produced, it can be collected and returned to the bulk liquor, or collected separately and analyzed for the secondary metabolites, such as antimicrobial agents. This is completed by partitioning the metabolites into the foam and breaking the foam into a condensed foam liquid. The metabolites can then be removed from the foam and collected for various applications. This method of foam collection is unique among the current technology. As stated above, the presence of foam is generally taught to be avoided, but this technology promotes its production and uses it as a means to collect metabolites that may only be present during specific, short periods of time within the chemical reactions. Using the current technology, these metabolites may be overlooked and therefore depleted by other products of the reaction. Although not typically the primary target of these reactions, these metabolites can be desirable and useful, and the foam provides a way for the metabolites to be collected and separated from the other components of the reaction. This invention provides not only a way to separate and purify short-lived metabolites, but it also minimizes end-product feed-back inhibition, thus speeding up the metabolic processes leading to these products.

    "ip_description": "A non-invasive and automated tumor budding image analysis system for colorectal cancer. This program can detect tumor buds in traditional H&E stained sections without the need for manual assessment. Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States. With a survival rate of less than 65%, early detection and treatment are key factors in survival. Tumor budding, associated with higher tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and decreased disease-free survival, has emerged as an important adverse prognostic factor in a multitude of cancer types, including colorectal cancer. A growing number of institutions, including The Ohio State University Medical Center, are including tumor budding counts as an essential part of their colorectal cancer screening protocol. Tumor bud identification by manual methods using H&E stained tissue sections is a time intensive task for routine pathologic evaluation of colorectal cancer and alternative techniques have been developed, such as staining with pan-cytokeratin (AE 1/3). However, with AE 1/3 the costs to produce slides and obtain the counts are typically prohibitive. In addition, AE 1/3 staining is not routinely used in evaluation of colorectal cancer and only H&E staining is recommended by the College of American Pathologists for scoring of tumor budding. Computer analysis of tumor budding has been proposed to relieve the high cost burden and subjectivity of manual analysis but little or no success has been demonstrated with routine H&E stained slides. Such a solution, directed to H&E staining, will improve colorectal cancer screening and diagnostic effectiveness, and will help centers comply with recent CAP recommendations. Researchers at The Ohio State University have developed an automated system for identifying tumor buds in a digitized, whole slide image of an H&E stained section of a tumor. A machine learning classifier is employed comprising three stages: color deconvolution, textural and shape analysis, and statistical analysis. After training with H&E stained images, the classifier is used for tumor bud identification. The reliability of the automated system was initially demonstrated using cases from the Ohio Colorectal Cancer Prevention Initiative cohort. Overall, sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 84.3% against ground truth were achieved, demonstrating system reliability. Predictive models are under development that will associate clinically relevant outcomes such as time to tumor recurrence and time to progression with tumor budding scores generated by the automated system.",

III-Nitride ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV LEDs) have a variety of promising applications, including sterilization and water purification. Currently, UV LEDs use an absorbing p-GaN top layer for hole injection, which reduces light extraction efficiency to lower than 20%. UV light emissions down to 210 nm have been achieved for AlGaN-based UV LEDs, but the wall-plug efficiency (WPE) of UV LEDs remains much lower than InGaN-based visible LEDs. The reduced efficiency is attributed to a combination of the poor light extraction efficiency due to high internal light absorption in the widely used p-GaN cap layer and the low injection efficiency associated with the low thermally activated hole density. Thus, there is a need to improve this light extraction efficiency. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Siddharth Rajan, have developed a novel method to enhance light extraction efficiency in tunnel-injected III-Nitride ultraviolet LEDs. This method uses reflective surfaces on top of a tunnel junction based LED structure to enhance both the transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarized light.

A radio frequency signal may typically consist of a single frequency carrier signal, modulated with some information signal. The purpose of a receiver is to extract the information signal from the carrier. This is commonly accomplished by mixing the received signal with one or more local reference signals generated within the receiver by an oscillator. The frequency of these reference signals must correspond with the received carrier frequency in a predetermined way, requiring a prior knowledge of the carrier signal frequency. Simultaneously, the generation and distribution of reference signals is challenging, and can have unintended effects on the information signal. A radio receiver that does not need prior knowledge of the incident signal frequency and does not need an oscillator would significantly simplify receiver design, lower cost, and reduce unintended effects on the information signal as a result of simultaneously generating and distributing reference signals.

Instantaneous and predictive information about sea waves is critical to forecast ship motion, which is needed for many applications, such as cargo transfer and helicopter landing at sea. Scientists use radar to obtain this information, but several challenges must be overcome to develop a robust wave measurement system. In particular, the \u201clow grazing angle\u201d geometry of ship-based or ground-based radar measurements at long ranges complicates the physics of the surface scattering process and inhibits inversion of radar measurements into sea wave information. To improve forecasting of ship movement, it is necessary to develop a robust method to measure sea wave properties that address issues created by a 'low grazing angle.' Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Joel Johnson, have developed an X-band marine radar system for wave height and velocity measurements. This radar system is based on the coherent-on-receive approach with a traditional marine navigation radar having a 25 kW magnetron-based transmitter. In addition, the horizontally polarized antenna of the traditional radar was replaced with a vertically polarized antenna due to the increased sea backscatter returns expected in \u201cVV\u201d as opposed to \u201cHH\u201d polarization. The radar provides sea surface backscattered power and velocity measurements to ranges of approximately 4 km. A \u201cwavefield processor\u201d algorithm is applied to combine radar measurements at multiple azimuth angles into an improved measurement of sea waves and velocities. Thus, formed sensor data is fed into the ship motion prediction subsystem, which in turn provides the short term forecast of the relevant ship motion parameters. Commercial Applications: Cargo Transfer, Radar Systems, Ship Navigation and Control, Offshore Platform Operations.

    "ip_description": "A new method of power harvesting based on electroceutical dressings dampened by a saline solution. On-body electronics, such as wearable and epidermal sensors, are experiencing significant growth. One of the biggest challenges of on-body electronics is the development or identification of a sufficient power source. To address the former concern, sensors are becoming available with ever-lower power requirements, and many are already working with only a few microwatts. Though batteries are typically employed for powering on-body electronics, they are bulky and require frequent recharging or replacement. As an alternative, a number of power harvesting methods have been reported, including Radio Frequency (RF), solar, thermoelectric, and piezoelectric scavenging. Particularly RF power harvesting is becoming increasingly popular for on-body electronics. However, RF power harvesting requires large antennas, complicated and bulky electronics printed on rigid substrates, and RF sources located in close proximity to the subject. Therefore, it would be desirable to develop a novel method of power harvesting that addresses these concerns. Researchers at The Ohio State University have developed a new method of power harvesting from electroceutical dressings. Static (DC) voltage and current generated by the electroceutical dressing result in DC power that can be stored in a capacitor and used to power an electronic device (e.g. sensor). The team has also developed a method for connecting multiple electroceutical dressings to generate adjustable power levels. Commercial Applications: On-body electronics, Energy, Healthcare, Wound healing. Benefits/Advantages: Does not require any complicated or bulky electronics, Fabric-based, making it fully flexible and conformal, May be enabled via exudates that are readily available on-body (sweat, wound exudate, etc.).

Butanol is generally used as an industrial solvent but can also be blended with gasoline and used as transportation fuel. Butanol is commonly produced using fossil fuels, but it can also be produced from biomass, referred to as biobutanol. Biobutanol is produced from fermentation of the same feedstocks as ethanol - corn, sugar beets, and other types of biomass. (Alternative Fuels Data Center, U.S. Dept. of Energy). Traditionally, biobutanol was fermented in a process that produced acetone and ethanol along with the butanol. This process is known as ABE and used microbes that were poisoned by the butanol it produced once the alcohol reached a certain concentration. In addition, the yield was low and highly susceptible to butanol toxicity. New methods of producing large amounts of clean butanol are needed to further adaptation of this solvent for transportation fuels. Researchers at The Ohio State University led by Drs.

Nanomaterials, more specifically nanoparticle reinforced composites, are one of the best solutions for most lightweight applications. Due to the dispersion and high aspect ratio of nanoparticles, lightweight polymer nanocomposites exhibit dimensional stability, heat and flame resistance, barrier properties, and improved modulus and strength with far less reinforcement loading than conventional composites. While nanoparticles reinforce the polymer matrix, the loading of nanoparticles in polymer nanocomposites is often limited due to dispersion issues. Thus, mechanical properties of polymer nanocomposites are relatively low compared with those of highly loaded conventional fiber-reinforced plastics. For nanocomposites to realize their full potential, materials that demonstrate equal or better mechanical properties compared to fiber-reinforced plastics must be developed. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. L.

    "ip_description": "A robust solution that helps researchers increase image and signal accuracy of Atomic Force Microscopy. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was first used to characterize properties of a sample, including physical, material, electromechanical and chemical properties. For most of these multi-physical characterization schemes, an AFM tip scans over a sample while the tip is in contact with the surface. At the same time, a certain type of stimulus at a fixed frequency is applied either through the cantilever tip or to the sample directly, and the resulting response of the sample is eventually measured by sensing the corresponding cantilever deflection at the excitation (stimulus) frequency. As expected, the resulting mechanical response confined under the nanometer scale AFM tip is often very small, being comparable to or even less than the noise level. Currently, variable contact resonant frequency due to local mechanical contact conditions within AFM systems causes complicated artifacts. Researchers at The Ohio State University and in collaboration with the University of Illinois, led by Ohio State's Dr. Hanna Cho, have designed a cantilever for AFM with an inner silicon paddle used to measure the piezoelectric properties of a material. The silicon inner paddle oscillates independently of the outer paddle at the first fundamental frequency and the cantilever outputs a signal above the background noise, using contact resonance as amplification. The first contact resonance frequency of this new cantilever system does not vary with respect to the tip-sample stiffness as long as the contact is stronger than a critical value, which is confirmed to be true in actual AFM measurements. Commercial Applications: Biochemistry and Chemistry: imaging molecules, cells, and tissues; Materials Science and Nanotechnology: imaging polymers, nanostructures, and other materials; Physics and Biophysics: measuring forces.

The titanium additive manufacturing market is valued at $330 million, growing at a rapid pace and generating high revenue opportunities in the industry. As a result, optimizing the composition of titanium alloys for AM could prove to be extremely profitable. Additive manufacturing (AM) of current titanium alloys produces a columnar grain structure which leads to undesirable anisotropic material properties. Additional steps can reduce or eliminate the columnar grain structure, but the processes are costly and limit direct placement of the as-deposited component. As a result, applications for titanium alloy AM components are limited. There is a need to optimize the composition of titanium alloys for AM to improve the properties of manufactured components. Brian Welk and Hamish Fraser, researchers at The Ohio State University, have developed new titanium alloys for AM that reduce or eliminate the columnar grain structure typically observed in AM components. Alloying elements are added to pure titanium or titanium-based alloys to breakdown the columnar grain structure and form equiaxed grains. Mechanical testing of the alloys both perpendicular and parallel to the build direction show isotropic material properties. Ongoing research efforts have led the researchers to hypothesize that the equiaxed grain structure and isotropic material properties could allow the AM components to be put directly into service after manufacturing.

Color matching is critical for dental implants, cosmetic and beauty products, paints, textiles, and graphic design. Many techniques to evaluate color are subjective and do not produce consistent results. For example, when teeth are repaired or replaced during a dental procedure, additional material is added and shaded to match the existing teeth. In current practice, shade-matching methods for dental prosthetics are heavily subjective and can vary based on the technician performing the procedure. Colorimeters and spectrophotometers offer solutions that accurately evaluate light absorbance and reflection to determine color, but these devices are expensive. There is a need for a cost-effective, objective technique to evaluate color and match shade. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. William Johnston and Dr. Melody Carney, have developed a system that utilizes a digital camera and a set of optical properties to match color.

    "ip_description": "A zeolite catalyst with a unique chemical structure that utilizes paired Lewis acid sites to increase the catalytic selectivity for the isomerization of glucose and other sugars into fructose. Fructose is a key compound in the food and fermentation industries that is typically produced via the enzymatic isomerization of glucose. The enzymes used to efficiently convert glucose to fructose are expensive to manufacture and sensitive to processing conditions. An alternative approach is to design heterogeneous catalysts, such as zeolites, that mimic enzyme function. However, zeolites are commonly used for Bronsted acid catalyzed reactions. The catalytic capability of zeolites to mimic enzymatic conversions would be greatly improved with the use of Lewis acid sites that originate from metals. Inventors at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Nicholas Brunelli, have created a heterogeneous catalyst with zeolite material containing paired Lewis acid sites. This unique chemical structure increases catalytic selectivity for the isomerization of glucose and other sugars into fructose when compared with isolated Sn-BEA catalysts, the most commonly researched catalyst of this reaction. The process involves synthesizing a molecular precursor which is then incorporated with the synthesis of zeolite beta. Extensive characterization demonstrates that the paired site precursor is incorporated within the zeolite framework and is accessible. The catalyst may have additional uses and benefits in selective dehydrogenation of propane to propylene or synthesis of dimethylcarbonate from carbon dioxide, aldol condensations and Diels-Alder reactions. Commercial Applications: Convert glucose to fructose for food and drink applications, Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, Synthesis of dimethylcarbonate from CO2. Benefits/Advantages: More selective conversion of sugars to isomerization products.",

Currently, bioethanol is the major biofuel on the market, but recently butanol has gotten attention for its potential as a transportation fuel. It has many characteristics that make it a better fuel source than ethanol: butanol has 25% more Btu per gallon, it's less evaporative/explosive with a Reid vapor pressure 7.5 times lower than ethanol, it has a higher flashpoint, it's more miscible with gasoline and diesel fuel and less miscible with water, and butanol is noncorrosive, offering a safer fuel that can be dispersed through existing pipelines and filling stations. Butanol production is done almost exclusively via petrochemical routes, and the process is very inefficient and expensive. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Shang-Tian Yang, have developed a new method for the production of butyrate esters as novel biofuels. Butyrate esters have similar energy content and properties to biobutanol but are easier to produce via acid fermentation than biobutanol from sugars. The method to make the esters involves butyric acid fermentation followed with esterification with an alcohol. Butyric acid and ethanol can be more easily and economically produced by using existing fermentation technologies. The invented process can be used in an integrated biorefinery to produce both high-value products and advanced biofuels from biomass and food processing wastes.

However, PMMA makes for a difficult substrate because of complexities with respect to adhesion. This technology presents two new methods for enhanced protein binding onto PMMA. Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is a synthetic resin in the acrylic family, often used as a substitute for glass or as a material for biomedical devices. PMMA-based biosensors have low protein binding efficiency and low sensitivity. PMMA is used in a variety of applications like immunoassays, biosensors, protein biochips, and biocatalysis.

A lead inhibitor compound (LLL12b) and its analogs have been shown to suppress the expression of pSTAT3 and production of IL-17 and other inflammatory cytokines in myelin-specific CD4 T cells, in a dose-dependent manner. Multiple in vivo experiments in mice where the disease was induced in different ways or the treatment regime varied demonstrate marked therapeutic benefit in suppressing disease progression: (1) disease was induced by adoptive transfer of activated myelin-specific T cells (figure 1A-C); (2) disease was induced in C57BL6 mice immunized with the myelin peptide MOG 35-55 (figure 1 D-E); (3) disease was evaluated in SJL/J mice immunized with the myelin peptide PLP 139-151, which develop a relapsing-remitting disease course resembling relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) (RRMS being the major MS subtype affecting more than 85% of MS patients), permitting treatment assessment at various stages of disease, including administration during the acute phase (figure 1F); or (4) remission phase (days 25\u201335 after immunization) (figure 1G-H). As well, in LLL12b-treated groups, Foxp3+ T regulatory cells were increased (figure 1B) while Th17 cells suppressed (figure 1C, E, H). Additionally, the small-molecule prodrug shifts the balance of T cells from MS patients toward biennial regulatory T cells.

    "ip_description": "A class of compounds possessing potent immunomodulatory activity, to enhance the protection of vaccines against infectious agents. While vaccines are commonly used today for a variety of diseases and have proven efficacious for disease prevention, some vaccines do not efficiently activate an immune response. About 10% of vaccinations fail to mount adequate antibody levels to routine vaccinations. Also, many viruses rapidly mutate into strains for which current vaccines are no longer active, and new vaccines cannot be quickly developed. Hence, there is an unmet need to develop new technologies to improve the effectiveness of vaccination. Adjuvants can be included in a given vaccine to potentiate immune activation and improve the quality of the vaccine.

    "ip_description": "The medical physics group in the Department of Radiation Oncology has devised a 6DoF phantom that is the first of its kind to fully integrate multiple routine QA tests specifically for a six degrees-of-freedom linac table. 6DoF treatment tables allow for 2 additional degrees (pitch and roll) compared to traditional 4DoF (vertical, lateral, longitudinal, and yaw) when correcting for patient setup during image-guidance prior to treatment delivery. These tables allow for more accurate patient treatments and could potentially increase efficacy in target delivery while decreasing side effects to normal tissues. Since this 6DoF technology is relatively new, few quality assurance (QA) devices have been developed in order to test this new technology in a streamlined manner. The 6DoF phantom is the first of its kind to fully integrate multiple routine QA tests specifically for a six degrees-of-freedom linac table. This user friendly phantom streamlines multiple routine QA tests in a quick and consistent manner. The phantom has the capability to verify table translation (vertical, lateral, and longitudinal) and rotation (pitch, roll, and yaw) movements, verify volumetric image registration, test isocentricity of mechanical and radiation isocenter, and validate external laser alignment while following the most stringent TG-142 tolerances. With an established reference CT using an accompanying leveler to achieve a straightened position, the phantom is designed with known translation and rotation offset marks. This phantom was designed without leveling pins. Thus, one cannot accidentally adjust the rotation of the phantom from the reference imaging. This allows for quick and consistent setup for routine QA. The design and shape of the phantom includes complex geometry that allows for a better registration via the vendor\u2019s automatic registration algorithm. This is exemplified by the unique registration structures on the faces of the phantom, which can be customized to any shape or font the manufacturer desires. These structures also provide a visual verification at the registration console for the user to assess the quality of the registration. An embedded ball bearing is included in the center of the phantom for the purpose of Winston-Lutz isocentricity delivery. After translation and rotation adjustments are performed via volumetric imaging, the final table position places the center of the ball bearing at the mechanical isocenter. A plan with small fields and electronic portal imaging acquisition can be delivered at representative cardinal angles for gantry, couch, and collimator positions. Winston-Lutz analysis can be performed offline once delivery is completed. Visual verification of the external lasers can be performed once table adjustments and Winston-Lutz delivery is completed. The phantom includes two sets of marks: initial offset alignment marks and final isocenter marks indicating the center of the ball bearing. The mark thickness is designed to test the most stringent TG-142 tolerance for laser verification. Lasers will run flush along both sets of offset and isocenter marks, as they have the appropriate rotational orientation for both initial and final table position.",

    "ip_description": "Rinses with sustained contact time and field coverage have been developed to prevent oral cancer. Oral cancer affects nearly 50,000 Americans each year and has a five year survival rate of 57%. Often, oral cancer is only discovered when it has metastasized, as it does not present recognizable symptoms, and it has a high risk of producing secondary tumors. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a particularly malignant subset, is one of the most challenging to treat and over 35% of patients with OSCC die from local recurrence. Treatment of oral cancers typically include chemotherapy and radiation, although some tumors can be surgically excised. Patients with precursor lesions are at high risk for transformation to OSCC and multiple biopsies are required to check patients, resulting in a large economic burden to patients. Following treatment, patients may have disfigurements requiring additional surgery to correct, further exacerbating issues and costs for these diseases. In order to target these cancers before symptoms arise, physicians have been developing local delivery chemopreventive methods to target clinically evident premalignant lesions. However, some lesions are not easily visualized and current treatment protocols and methods are inefficient for clinically unseen developing premalignant lesions throughout the mouth. Therefore, development of new, efficacious, and well-tolerated chemopreventive is needed for improved outcomes of oral cancer diagnoses and to reduce socioeconomic burdens on patients. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Dr. Susan Mallery, have developed novel controlled-release nanoparticles capable of providing on-demand chemopreventive agents to increase the efficiency of the chemopreventive rinse treatments. These agents, derived from black raspberries, a synthetic vitamin A analogue, N-acetylcystein, and an anti-interleukin 6 (IL-6) agent, are loaded onto Janus particles for delivery concurrently. Two of these agents may be utilized at one time, although additional components such as a mucoadhesive or mucous penetration enhancer may also be added. The target for the chemopreventive agents is the epithelia lining of the oral cavity, with broad exposure to the entire area, rather than a targeted delivery. By utilizing Janus nanoparticles loaded with chemopreventive agents, oral lesions will be exposed to the drugs, and therapeutically relevant drugs will be delivered to treatment sites without systemic side effects. Commercial Applications: Treatment and prevention of oral squamous cell carcinoma and other oral cancers, Prevent or treat OSCC progression or recurrence, Prevent progression of or recurrence of periodontal disease arising from necrotizing tissue, gingivitis, gum recession, and other diseases.

    "ip_description": "A novel method using the overexpression of survival motor neuron protein to improve motor unity synaptic repair and restore/protect muscle size and function due to sarcopenia. Muscle weakness (sarcopenia) affects more than 5% of those over 60. It is a geriatric syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, leading to impaired mobility, slow gait, decreased quality of life, and death. Healthcare costs associated with muscle weakness are more than $18 billion annually within the US, accounting for more than 1.5% of total direct health costs. Treatment is dependent upon identifying the underlying cause of weakness, often requiring physical & occupational therapy, medications, dietary changes, and in some cases, surgery. Current treatment options are helpful in some cases, but there are limited drugs that can address the underlying causes that prevent recovery of muscle strength. This technology represents a new therapeutic strategy to treat sarcopenia in subjects 35 years old or older (including those with nerve injury and at risk for developing sarcopenia). OSU researchers showed that increasing levels of the SMN protein (through modification of mRNA splicing of SMN2 to include exon 7) is critical for the repair of motor unit connectivity after injury, and has the potential to improve nerve regeneration and reduce aging-related motor unit losses. More specifically, they showed that treating aged mice with the pyridazine derivative RG7800 improves motor function (twitch & tetanic muscle torque) when compared to placebo controls. The novel method targets the SMN2 gene by repurposing existing MSA therapies, including small molecules (e.g. risdiplam or similar pyridazine derivatives, such as RG7800), antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) (e.g. nusinersen), or even scAAV9-SMN (e.g. onasemnogene abeparvovec).

Extends existing MSA therapies to the treatment of neuromuscular disorders such as sarcopenia and nerve injury. Novel target for treatment of sarcopenia. The techniques allow assessment of the whole motor unit in a longitudinal fashion, and can provide important insight into the functional interaction of muscle, neuron, and synaptic factors in the development of sarcopenia.

The global diabetic care market was valued at 22.7 billion USD in 2019, with a forecasted CAGR of 7.9% from 2020-2027 (41.7 billion USD). There are no treatments to prevent diabetes-associated neurological pain or peripheral neuropathy (neurodegeneration in peripheral tissues), nor cognitive dysfunction in diabetes patients who develop resistance to insulin, with potential links to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. These complications can also lead to dementia, in addition to more well-known issues such as impaired wound healing, amputations of limbs, blindness, and kidney failure. Insulin analogs use can provide protection against hyperglycemia in T1D. These patients, however, remain at high risk for developing cognitive impairment and permanent brain damage. Similar insulin analogs cannot be used to treat insulin-resistant patients, who represent most of the patients with T2D. For those who cannot afford expensive or frequent treatment with insulin, these symptoms progress rapidly towards further complications and death.\n\n**The Technology**\nResearchers at the Ohio State University, led by Dr. Jon Parquette and Dr. Ouliana Ziouzenkova, have developed AAC2, a highly potent short peptide comprising amino acids with a modified coumarin side chain. It exhibits glycemic efficacy in peripheral tissues and the brain. In insulin-resistant mice with T2D, the molecule is stable and safely reduces hyperglycemia, neurological pain, and anxiety. In insulin-deficient mice with T1D, AAC2 improves glucose uptake and prevents death with similar efficacy as insulin. Importantly, AAC2 rescues mice from cognitive decline, preventing brain mass loss and reducing anxiety-related behavior. Glucose uptake efficiency has been tested in cultures of human adipocytes obtained from insulin-resistant patients with morbid obesity as well as endothelial cells comprising the blood brain barrier. Unlike insulin and other current diabetes therapeutics, AAC2 increases glucose uptake via the insulin-independent GLUT1 transporter in nervous tissue (interacting specifically with the leptin receptor (LepR) and activating atypical protein kinase C zeta (PKC\u03c2)), which underlies its efficacy for nervous tissue as well as insulin-resistant tissues. Furthermore, since insulin acts through the insulin-dependent GLUT4 transporter in peripheral tissues, AAC2-bound insulin synergistically improves glycemic efficacy performance in the brain, sufficient to rescue cognitive performance. AAC2 is much less expensive than proteins like insulin and corresponding analogs.\n\n**Commercial Applications**\n*   Diabetes and pre-diabetes\n*   Neurological complications and neuropathies associated with diabetes\n*   Obesity associated with diabetes\n\n**Benefits/Advantages**\n*   A new therapeutic platform for the treatment of diabetes, and especially its neurological complications\n*   Minimizes neurological complications that cannot be addressed by other diabetes treatments\n*   Effective in insulin-resistant subjects (T2D)\n*   May be used by itself or in combination with insulin\n*   May be administered in several ways, depending on whether local or systemic treatment is desired\n*   May be administered prophylactically or as a treatment\n*   Less expensive than insulin and corresponding analogs",

    "ip_description": "Researchers at The Ohio State University have discovered Compound 13, a patent protected, orally bioavailable and brain penetrant Mps1/TTK inhibitor that exhibits single agent tumor growth inhibition in a murine xenograft model of human triple negative breast cancer upon daily administration. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous group of tumors, which can be subdivided based on histopathological features, genetic alterations, and gene-expression profiles. Approximately 50-60% of all breast cancer patients and two-thirds of postmenopausal breast cancer patients have estrogen receptor positive tumors (ER+). Adjuvant hormonal therapy is the primary therapy for ER+ breast cancer. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the absence of staining for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2/neu. Approximately 10-25% of all breast cancers diagnosed in the United States are TNBC. Current therapies for subtypes of breast cancer, such as TNBC and other aggressive phenotypes, rely on standard chemotherapy approaches with significant side effects; therefore, newer targeted therapy approaches are needed. A series of published studies between 2011 and 2014 have shown that Mps1 is overexpressed in breast cancer and its expression correlates with poor survival in TNBC patients. Mps1 activates the spindle assembly checkpoint to ensure faithful segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. In cancer, chromosomal instability is common and Mps1 upregulation prevents mitotic catastrophe due to severe aneuploidy, which allows the cancer to survive. Pharmacological inhibition of Mps1 causes severe defects in chromosomal segregation, causing catastrophic levels of aneuploidy. This results in arrest of TNBC progression. Reduction in Mps1 levels results in apoptosis of cancer cells and decreased growth of the cells _in vivo_. Thus, Mps1 presents as a potential therapeutic target for aggressive breast cancers. At least four Mps1 inhibitors are currently in Phase I clinical trials. Recent studies discussed below show that Compound 13 is another potential clinical candidate for companies to consider. A team of researchers at The Ohio State University designed, synthesized, and evaluated various candidate compounds in anti-proliferative assays and selected Compound 13 as the lead compound. _In vivo_ studies using daily intraperitoneal (ip) dosing of Compound 13 showed promising T1/2 and IC50 values (Sugimoto et al., Bioorg Med Chem, 2017; 25:2156-66). Additional studies also showed that Compound 13 is orally bioavailable and brain penetrant in mice. _In vitro_ functional assays confirmed that Compound 13 disrupted the proper functioning of the spindle assembly checkpoint and decreased centriole duplication. Tumor-bearing mice dosed daily for six weeks with an efficacious dose of Compound 13 exhibited no adverse effects on body weight. More specifically, Compound 13 showed significant decreased tumor growth. The totality of these studies show that Compound 13 is worthy of further investigation as a potential targeted therapy for TNBC in both single agent and combination therapy settings.",

    "ip_description": "A novel method to increase the effectiveness and practicality of the cancer treatment drug Flavopiridol. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia and the current therapies are not curative. High-risk genetic modifications are associated with poor response to traditional therapies. Flavopiridol, a broad-spectrum cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, activates significant clinical activity in CLL patients who are in relapse after long and complex treatment regimens and who carry high-risk genetic mutations. Although flavopiridol has been shown to be effective in treatment of CLL, other hematologic malignancies (lymphoma, AML, ALL and solid tumors) are relatively less responsive to this therapy. In addition, in one study, only 53% of high-risk patients receiving flavopiridol treatment showed a partial/complete response (Byrd et al. 2009). Therefore, flavopiridol alone is not the best option for CLL patients or others with hematologic malignancies. The Ohio State University researchers, led by Drs. John Byrd and Dr. Michael Grever, have discovered that autophagy plays an important role in treatment for patients with CLL. Flavopiridol is a broad-spectrum cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and induces autophagy in CLL patients. Adding in chloroquine, which also inhibits autophagy, enhances the efficiency of the flavopiridol and extends the treatment to non-responsive tumors to flavopiridol as well as enhancing the clinical activity of flavopiridol in other cancer types.

    "ip_description": "A method for enhancing the transmission capabilities of sapphire optical fiber for use in extreme environments. Optical fibers are lightweight, small in diameter, and immune to electromagnetic interference. Signal attenuation over great distances is minimal and there is a high potential for large bandwidth data transfer. These qualities make optical fiber-based sensors an ideal candidate for measurements where space is limited. Silica fibers are chemically inert and have a high melting point, 1400 C, making these fibers the current gold standard for harsh environment sensing. As engineers take on ever more challenging projects the limits of silica fiber optic sensors will be pushed. Testing of silica optical fiber beyond its limits has already demonstrated problems, during increased temperature exposure the sensing capabilities of silica optical fiber began to fail and the fiber itself began to crystallize. A plethora of markets will be interested in increasing the limits of optical sensing fibers, new materials and manufacturing processes must be developed in order to move past the 1400 C threshold. Researchers at the Ohio State University, led by Dr. Thomas Blue, have developed a method for enhancing the transmission qualities of sapphire optical fibers by adding an internal cladding. A variety of optical and material sciences engineering challenges have prevented sapphire from becoming the dominate optical fiber material. The first challenge to using sapphire fibers in a sensing network was to increase signal transmission efficiency to that of silica fibers. The best way to increase optical signal transmission is to add a cladding to the optical fiber. However under harsh conditions the cladding needs to maintain its integrity through the whole temperature range and remain chemically inert. Dr. Blue\u2019s brilliant solution was to create a cladding layer by irradiating the sapphire fiber this displaces the atoms a few micrometers deep which changes the index of refraction. This modified layer works as a cladding with identical thermal and chemical properties of sapphire. Dr. Blues technology has shown under lab conditions that it can withstand temperatures of up to 1500 C. This breakthrough will allow engineers to monitor temperatures in confined spaces under extremely harsh conditions. This technology can be utilized to develop sensors and smart structures for: * Aerospace/Defense * Oil and Gas * Utilities and Construction * Nuclear reactor monitoring * Chemical plant monitoring * Life Sciences. Benefits/ Advantages: * Can operate at temperatures higher than silica optical fiber, 1500 C. * Resists degradation by the environment compared to traditional thermocouples, due to sapphire being chemically inert. * Reduces the amount of light modes in the sapphire optical fiber so that the fiber can be used for distributed temperature measurements. * Sensing capability of the sapphire optical fiber has been demonstrated and its transmission performance is comparable to a multi-modal silica fiber with an increased thermal operating range.",

According to the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database, 267,269 children (\u2264 5 years of age) were treated in US emergency rooms for household cleaning product-related injuries between 1990-2006. Spray bottles, which accounted for 40.1% of these cases, were the most likely products to cause injury. Most spray bottles for household hazardous chemicals incorporate child-resistant locks, such as a rotating locks. However, these child-resistant locks are useless when disengaged or improperly used, which can expose a child to chemical related injuries. To mitigate injury risk due to household chemicals, a child-resistant locking mechanism that automatically reengages after use and is easy to use for adults must be developed for spray bottles. Researchers at The Ohio State University, led by Carolina Gill, have developed a novel locking mechanism for spray bottles to ensure the safety of children and reduce the prevalence of accidental poisonings and injuries from household chemicals. Rather than relying on the twisting of the tip of the sprayer to provide the locking capability, this child-resistant sprayer utilizes an additional lever that prohibits the use of the trigger until the safety lever is depressed. This design allows for comfortable, easy use for adults but poses difficulty for children whose hands are much smaller. The incorporation of the spring-assisted safety lever also allows for the sprayer to automatically reengage the locking mechanism at the end of each use.

Treatment failure is one of the leading causes of death in patients with human acute leukemia, yet the cause of treatment failure is still largely unknown. Overexpression of the RNA gene miR-3151 and its host gene, Brain and Acute Leukemia, Cytplasmic (BAALC), is a sign of an ineffective treatment outcome. Targeting miR-3151 as the causal agent of chemo-resistance could improve the clinical outcome in leukemia cases that overexpress BAALC, allowing for improved rates of remission with resilient cases of acute leukemia. Treatment that regulates the expression of miR-3151 in patients with human acute leukemia would improve their chance of survival.

During the procedure, the surgeon creates a small hole, called an anastomosis, to reconnect the newly created stomach to the small intestine. Current State-of-the-Art Roux-en-Y anastomosis devices consist of two pieces: 1) Anvil that provides a stable backing for stapling and cutting of the tissue, and 2) Handle that houses and deploys the cutting blade and staples. Two major problems exist with the current circular stapling devices that perform the anastomosis procedure. First, the 25-30 mm anvil head is bulky and rigid, which makes proper placement of the device within the body difficult. Second, the anvil and stapling head of the device must be connected inside the body, which proves difficult due to poor depth perception and visibility.

    "published_date": "",
    "ip_description": "An enhanced nucleic acid amplification system that is more efficient and cost-effective than conventional polymerase chain reaction methods. Identification of a particular nucleic acid is desirable in the use of diagnostic and forensic applications. However, often the target nucleic acid sequence may only be a small portion of the DNA or RNA in question so that it might be difficult to detect the presence of the target sequence using probes. Processes like Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification are used to amplify the target sequence so that it is present in sufficient quantities. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a diagnostic and quantification tool used by researchers in molecular biology, genetics, and forensic science. Current RT-PCR techniques have several drawbacks, which limit their diagnostic capabilities. Thermal cyclers are needed to constantly initiate denaturation and annealing of sequenced DNA, which is costly and can increase mis-priming of products and influence an unstable environment for polymerases. The yield of specified products is also limited in quantitative RT-PCR diagnostics due to the competition between primer binding and self-annealing of product. In addition, RT-PCR mechanisms are overly complex especially in consideration of the separate binding sites utilized for primer and probe sequences. Dr. Besik Kankia and colleagues at The Ohio State University have developed an amplification system to reduce or eliminate the shortcomings of PCR and clone generation in sequencing for nucleic acids. In addition, they have pioneered a new method of immobilizing nucleic acids for identification. Quadruplex priming amplification (QPA) uses universal guanine primers to create quadruplex nucleic acid sequences. Once formed, the free energy of the DNA quadruplexes drives endergonic reactions of nucleic acids. QPA eliminates DNA self-annealing and proceeds under nearly isothermal conditions. Additionally, fluorescent nucleotide analogs can be incorporated into the primers, eliminating the need for attachment of probe molecules. This technology is a sensitive, specific, robust, and inexpensive method of amplifying DNA and provides significant advantages over the current gold standard. In order to enhance their next generation sequencing method, Dr. Kankia refined quadruplex priming amplification to make it a completely isothermal process, which returns a 1010-fold amplification of a DNA signal in less than 40 minutes. By moving from a linear amplification process to a loop process, not only is an isothermal process possible, but the method can be used in detection of RNA pathogens without reverse transcription. Furthermore, this new sequencing method removes competition from self-annealing, since the process keeps the target region and extended end bound. Finally, with no use for complementary primers, the problem of primer dimers is eliminated. Commercial Applications: Pharmaceutical Development, Forensic Science, Molecular biology, Genetics. Benefits/Advantages: Removes temperature considerations, Higher stability and specificity with QPA, Lower cost and higher yields.",

    "ip_description": "A highly pure and efficient method for anthocyanin purification from fruits and vegetables. Anthocyanins are natural pigments responsible for the vivid red to blue colors of many fruits and vegetables. As highly consumed dietary antioxidants, anthocyanins are receiving increasing attention due to their potential health benefits. Growing evidence from epidemiological, cell culture, animal and clinical studies suggests preventive and therapeutic effects from anthocyanins on oxidative stress related diseases such as cancer and coronary heart disease. Extraction and fractionation of high purity anthocyanins from fruits and vegetables are important for many biological studies as well as food processing applications. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) methods are currently the most commonly used to purify anthocyanin extracts, due to a balance of efficiency and cost. However, the existing methods normally rely on hydrophilic or hydrophobic interactions between the sorbent and the analyte, where a broad spectrum of plant constituents will inevitably mix with the anthocyanin fraction. The impurities, usually phenolic compounds, are likely to interfere with anthocyanin bioactivity in scientific studies and accelerate the degradation of anthocyanins in commercial applications. As a result, a more specific purification is required to ensure anthocyanin potency as a supplement or additive.
