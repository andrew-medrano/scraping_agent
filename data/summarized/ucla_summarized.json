    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers from the Department of Medicine have developed a method for synthetic microvascular network generation for improved coronary disease monitoring.Background:Synthetic microvascular network modeling can be used in diagnosing and managing microvascular diseases such as coronary microvascular disease (CMD). CMD is traditionally diagnosed using invasive techniques that require specialized equipment, limiting their routine use. Noninvasive imaging techniques have emerged as promising alternatives, but existing methods suffer from low and inadequate resolution for precise diagnosis. Computational modeling approaches have been recently developed for this purpose but are constrained by simplified assumptions about vascular structure and blood flow. There remains an unmet need for an advanced method to generate realistic and patient-specific models of microvascular networks for the precise and non-invasive diagnosis of microvascular disorders.Innovation:UCLA researchers from the Department of Medicine have developed a novel method to generate patient-specific synthetic microvascular networks for disease diagnosis. The model integrates imaging biomarkers such as myocardial blood volume maps obtained using traditional imaging techniques such as MRI with three-dimensional models of epicardial coronary arteries to generate a synthetic model of the coronary microvasculature with a resolution of 100 \u03bcm. This novel method captures the unique features of a patient\u2019s coronary microvasculature, allowing for accurate and non-invasive computation of different diagnostic metrics.

    "ip_name": "A Novel Lymphocyte Stimulation Assay To Quantify Immune Responses",
    "ip_number": "2022-079",

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the Department of Medicine have developed lymphocyte stimulation assays to evaluate immune responses, supporting various clinical applications such as adjusting immunosuppressant drug levels and advancing COVID-19 vaccine development. The assay systems are reliable, cost-effective, and easy-to-perform, providing accurate assessments of immune response adequacy.\n\nBACKGROUND:The immune response, mediated by a complex interaction between leukocytes and signaling molecules known as cytokines, is the body\u2019s mechanism for defending against harmful or foreign antigens such as bacteria, viruses, cancer cells, and transplanted organs. The ability to accurately quantify antigen-specific immune responses holds significant clinical value. In solid organ transplantation, accurately assessing the level of immunosuppression in recipients is essential to prevent acute rejection from under-immunosuppression, as well as infections and malignancies resulting from over-immunosuppression. To date, there are still no reliable methods to assess a transplant recipient\u2019s level of immunosuppression. Available methods for assessing immune function, such as the ImmuKnow assay, suffer from poor sensitivity, specificity, and limited clinical utility. More recently, the AlloSure Lung Test that measures the percent of donor-derived cell free DNA present in the plasma received FDA approval as a diagnostic test of acute rejection. Unfortunately, this test also has poor performance characteristics with a positive predictive value of 44%, negative predictive value of 84%, and a cost of over $2500 per test. The current assay developed by UCLA researchers has a cost of $20 with performance characteristics that are expected to exceed the AlloSure Lung Test.\n\nAdditionally, quantifying immune responses is crucial for efficient vaccine development, as it enables the assessment of an individual\u2019s protection against pathogens such as COVID-19, evaluates immunity to novel variants, and aids in optimizing vaccine dosing. Despite the known importance of the cellular immune response in protection against infectious pathogens, available assays of cellular immunity are limited. Cellular responses to viral pathogens are most often measured using flow cytometry with intracellular staining or ELISPOT, both of which are expensive, labor-intensive and require specialized expertise, thus limiting their widespread application. Furthermore, these assays measure the frequency of responding cells, usually based on pre-determined cytokine panels that include interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-2, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa), without regard for the magnitude of cytokine expression by each cell.\n\nINNOVATION:UCLA researchers have developed a whole-blood T cell stimulation assay system (\u201cCytokine Response Assay\u201d [CRA]) that provide several advantages over ELISPOT and flow cytometry with intracellular staining including: 1) simplicity, 2) improved sensitivity, 3) physiologic stimulation involving all whole blood components, 4) the ability to evaluate the concurrent expression of many cytokines quantitatively. The CRA relies on the stimulation of memory T Cells by proteins of interest (e.g. SARS-CoV-2, influenza) and measuring the cytokine response pattern. An evaluation of hundreds of cytokines have identified specific cytokine responses that can serve as optimal biomarkers of the cellular immune response in question. This novel assay has showed promising preliminary data in murine studies and clinical studies in lung transplant recipients, as well as influenza and COVID-19 vaccine recipients. It has the potential to improve clinical management after solid-organ transplant recipients and facilitate the development of novel vaccines.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\nEvaluating immune responses in various contexts, including reactions to transplanted donor tissues, infectious organisms such as COVID-19 and influenza, vaccinations, and tumor cells.Tailoring of immunosuppressive medications for solid organ transplant recipients and patients with autoimmune disease based on assay results.Tool for efficient screening and development of vaccines.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\nThe ability to quantitatively measure cellular immune response to any protein of interest.Physiologic T cell stimulation involving all whole blood components.The ability to evaluate the concurrent expression of many cytokines quantitatively.Simple, reliable, inexpensive, and easy-to-perform.\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:Successful demonstration in murine tracheal transplant models, human lung transplant recipients, and individuals post influenza and SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.\n\nKEYWORDS:Immunization, immune activation, immune response, lymphocyte stimulation, cytokines, ligand, cytokine receptor, interferon-gamma, antibody, organ transplantation, immunosuppression, acute rejection, chronic rejection, cellular response, vaccine, COVID-19, influenza, d2biomarkers.",

    "ip_description": "Summary:Researchers in the UCLA Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a new, high-performance transistor for high-frequency and high-power systems.Background:Gallium nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are critical for high-frequency and high-power electrical applications due to their superior material properties, including their high electron mobility, electron saturation velocity, and breakdown field. Of these, N-polar GaN HEMTs are of particular utility over G-polar GaN HEMTs due to their improved charge confinement and enhanced charge density enabled by a thick GaN cap layer. However, despite the advantages of N-polar GaN HEMTs, manufacturing challenges remain. Industry-standard manufacturing of N-polar GaN HEMTs uses silicon nitride (SiN) dielectric gates, which must be deposited at high temperatures, limiting process flow, and a moderate dielectric constant, which hinders performance. To broaden industry adoption and widespread application of N-polar GaN HEMTs, there is an unmet need to overcome these fundamental limitations.Innovation:To address these limitations, inventors led by Professor Elaheh Ahmadi have developed atomic layer deposition (ALD) hafnium-based (HfSiO) gate dielectrics in N-polar GaN HEMTs. ALD is a widely used and accessible tool used throughout global semiconductor manufacturing. The low deposition temperatures of ALD eliminate traditional process limitations, allowing metal and even photoresist on samples prior to deposition. This enables new processes and earlier quality control checkpoints.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Radiology have developed a novel method to capture time-varying and irregular cardiac motion, producing high-precision, high-quality cine images.Background:Cine MRI is a specialized imaging technique that captures motion through a series of images, often used to evaluate cardiac function and morphology. In cases of complex arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), cine MRI struggles to capture dynamic changes accurately. AF has a high incidence in the United States, ranging from approximately 1-2%, further highlighting the need for enhanced imaging modalities. Irregular cardiac motion frequently leads to imaging artifacts and premature scan termination, hindering diagnostic accuracy of this imaging application. To improve patient outcome and prognosis, there is a need for an imaging method that considers intrinsic cardiac motion and consistently produces high-quality images for both regular and irregular rhythms.Innovation:Dr. Kim-Lien Nguyen and her research team have developed an innovative method for capturing smooth transition between dynamic cardiac motion states across a wide variety of motion patterns. The Dynamic Regularized Adaptive Cluster Optimization (DRACO) method is designed to address the limitations of current state-of-the-art techniques for representing cardiac motion. The adaptive system uses cluster grouping to optimize the generation of time-resolved cine images. By employing a probabilistic approach, it achieves smooth transitions while preserving the sequential timing of motion. Extensive testing has demonstrated the resulting images exhibit reduced noise, enhanced continuity of cluster positions, minimal image artifacts, improved edge sharpness, and the effective handling of time varying motion patterns, such as those intrinsic to atrial fibrillation (AF). DRACO thus offers a promising solution for quantifying cardiac function in the setting of atrial fibrillation and overcoming previous limitations in segmented cine MRI techniques.Potential Applications:\u25cf    Improved diagnosis of arrhythmias\u25cf    Personalized cardiac treatment planning\u25cf    Monitoring disease progression\u25cf    Non-invasive cardiac stress testingAdvantages:\u25cf    Reduces image artifacts\u25cf    Enhances imaging quality and reduces noise\u25cf    Improves temporal resolution\u25cf    Preserves sequential timing of cardiac phases\u25cf    Adapts to a wide range of cardiac motion patternsState of Development:Successfully replicated with complete experimentation proving hypotheses for increased image quality with the proposed model when compared to reference, existing imaging methods.Related Papers:1.

Unlike combustion engine vehicles, EVs lack a large engine block, which provides more flexibility in shaping the vehicle\u2019s geometry. This design flexibility can be leveraged to significantly reduce wind resistance on EVs. This is a critical benefit as it enhances vehicle efficiency and range, which remain a practical limitation to the widespread adoption of EVs.

Real-time imaging techniques of these microscale phenomena provide insights into the dynamic and non-equilibrium processes that occur during battery operation, facilitating the development of improved batteries. However, conventional tools are unable to properly characterize the dynamics of this interface type, leaving major gaps in our understanding of fundamental processes. Existing imaging techniques struggle to provide real-time, high-resolution insights into these dynamic and non-equilibrium interfacial states, particularly at the nanoscale. Specifically, current tools are unable to characterize these structures below 50nm, which is a blind spot that severely hampers battery technology development. There is a clear need for a real-time, nanoscale imaging system that would provide improved insights in solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs).Innovation:UCLA researchers have developed electrified cryogenic electron microscopy (eCryo-EM), a tool that can rapidly trap the dynamic states of the solid-liquid interface during battery operation.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering have developed a novel strategy to synthesize copolymers that can rapidly form robust adhesive hydrogel networks.Background:Wet adhesives provide robust and strong adhesion in moist or submerged environments. These materials are often synthesized using polymers that contain functional groups that mimic the natural adhesion mechanisms used by marine organisms. Existing approaches use catechol derivatives, which can form strong adhesions through covalent bonds and reversible interactions with chelating metals. These methods rely on incorporating catechol groups into polymers such as polyethylene glycol and polypeptides. Current technologies are limited by low and often uncontrolled catechol incorporation within the polymer structure. Other materials lack the mechanical strength and robustness needed for diverse applications and often require complicated synthesis and fabrication procedures. There remains an unmet need for a facile and efficient method of producing materials that possess adhesive properties in wet environmentsInnovation:UCLA researchers from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering have developed a novel approach to synthesize catechol functionalized copolymers with control over catechol density and placement. This strategy allows for direct incorporation of catechol groups into the polymer structure without the need for complicated synthesis techniques, enabling rapid and high-density functionalization.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry have developed a novel coating that is directly sprayed on body surfaces for improved health monitoring, particularly for deep tissues.Background:Deep tissue activities, such as blood circulation and brain function, provide crucial insight into normal and pathological tissue function. These activities are traditionally detected and monitored as changes in electrical potential or impedance at the body surface. Accurate detection of these signals is challenging as electrical signals at the body surface are attenuated by surface irregularities and mechanical mismatches between human tissue and existing electrical readout circuits. Current technologies struggle with stable contact and are prone to motion artifacts and therefore inaccurate signal readout. Other approaches, including ionic gel conductors, can cause discomfort and suffer from low spatial resolution. There remains an unmet need for a robust and comfortable nanomaterial that improves physiological signal monitoring accuracy.Innovation:UCLA researchers from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry have developed a material that can be directly sprayed on body surfaces for sensitive measurement of deep tissue functions. The innovation utilizes a biocompatible material that can be directly applied to the human body under ambient conditions to create an electrically functionalized body surface (EFBS). This technology generates conformal and adaptive van der Waals thin films (VDWTFs) that can form seamlessly on surfaces with irregular and dynamic features such as hairy skin.

    "ip_description": "Summary:Researchers in the Department of Plastic Surgery at UCLA have developed a new and improved drainage system for the removal of silicone from ruptured breast implants.Background:The removal of ruptured silicone breast implants has become increasingly common. Free silicone, a sticky and gelatinous substance, tends to adhere to tissue, making it challenging for surgeons to thoroughly remove it from native breast tissue. This can result in residual free silicone within the breast, posing additional complications. Currently, there are four methods for silicone removal: large incisions with en-bloc removal, manual extraction, use of a 60cc Toomey syringe with the plunger removed, and aspiration with suction. However, each method has significant limitations. En-bloc and manual techniques often fail to achieve controlled, complete removal. The limited capacity of the 60cc syringe can lead to silicone spillage, while aspiration is prone to clogging due to the thick, gelatinous nature of the silicone. These challenges highlight a critical need for a new removal system that can effectively address the limitations of existing methods for improved patient outcomes.Innovation:UCLA researchers in the Department of Plastic Surgery have developed a new drainage system for the removal of ruptured silicone breast implants. This system enables controlled removal using specialized suction tubing. It features a 1000cc capacity container with suction on one end and a 1-inch diameter spout on the other, designed to efficiently handle the volume and viscosity of free silicone.

These constraints hinder their integration into next-generation applications such as wearable and flexible electronics, compact cooling systems, and other space-constrained or adaptive environments. Recent innovations, such as electrocaloric materials capable of absorbing or releasing heat in response to an applied electric field, have shown promise. Despite this progress, these systems still suffer from inefficient heat transfer mechanisms and rigid designs, restricting their versatility and broader applicability.

The gestational period is a critical developmental stage, during which deficiency in maternal protein intake can cause cognitive impairment and anxiety in adult offspring. Human and animal studies have shown that abnormalities in the gut microbiome contribute to the stunting caused by malnutrition. Consequently, microbiome-based treatments hold promise for addressing malnutrition-induced growth defects. However, existing therapies for treating childhood stunting often fail to alleviate the associated neurobehavioral impairments, highlighting an unmet need for developing microbiome-based interventions to ameliorate the neurological comorbidities.\n\nINNOVATION:UCLA researchers have discovered that modifying the maternal microbiome can mitigate adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in offspring caused by maternal protein undernutrition. They have developed a maternal supplementation consisting of 10 diet and microbiome-dependent metabolites that can be administered during pregnancy to reduce the risk of abnormal brain and behavioral development in offspring. In mouse models, the metabolite cocktail was shown to be highly effective in preventing anxiety-like and cognitive behavior impairments in the long-term compared to nutrition support alone.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Urology and Surgery have developed a novel device to continuously track hemodynamic changes in the body wirelessly, compactly, and cost-effectively.Background:Continuous hemodynamic monitoring is essential to treat a variety of diseases, namely hypertension and heart failure, which are two of the leading causes of death in the United States. However, current blood pressure (BP) monitors such as the standard cuff involve a time consuming, cumbersome process causing low compliance as only 51% of at-risk adults perform recommended monitoring. Additionally, these devices only provide single-point measurements, failing to capture dynamic changes in the body over time, which are critical for accurate disease monitoring and diagnosis. Due to the lack of real-time monitoring capabilities, users cannot properly distinguish between normal and pathological BP fluctuations. Implantable sensors have been proposed as an alternative to standard BP monitoring. However, existing implantable sensors have not achieved widespread adoption due to their large external units, requirement for regular recalibration, and lack of clinically actionable data. Thus, there is an unmet need for a device that can provide continuous, flexible, and convenient real-time monitoring of hemodynamic changes for improved patient outcomes and decreased morbidity associated with heart failure.Innovation:Professor Rory Geoghegan and his research team have developed an innovative device that provides continuous hemodynamic measurements using transcutaneous fiber-optic communication. The device enables wireless data transmission between an implanted sensor and a wearable monitor, ensuring seamless real-time monitoring. Thorough experimentation has demonstrated the device\u2019s accurate performance across a broad range of tissue types, meeting the precision of standard monitoring devices. The device may either be integrated into a stent and positioned in patient arteries or veins, enabling right atrial filling pressure and central venous pressure (CVP) measurement, which is a valuable indicator of right heart function. Further, the device requires no recalibration and can adapt to multiple configurations, offering flexibility in both materials and wearability. Compared with the current state-of-the-art, this innovation enables greater compliance with treatment by providing convenient, continuous monitoring capabilities for patients at risk of heart failure.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at the UCLA Department of Neurology have developed an individualized method of delivering non-invasive electrical stimulation to treat acute human ischemic stroke.Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity across the world. Over 80% of strokes are ischemic due to blockage of blood vessels, causing a low blood flow state (ischemia). Treatments for acute ischemic stroke are limited to mechanical opening of the blood vessels via Endovascular Thrombectomy (EVT) or via intravenous lytic medications that can lyse the blood clot, opening the occluded vessel. However, the preponderance of patients are not EVT and lytic candidates, and even in patients who do receive them, outcomes remain suboptimal, with only 20-25% achieving a disability-free outcome. Therefore, there is a tremendous unmet need for developing more therapies for acute ischemic stroke patients.Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique that applies a weak electrical current to the brain via scalp electrodes. Preclinical studies testing tDCS in acute ischemic stroke models have shown that cathodal direct electrical current carries a strong neuroprotective effect, salvaging the ischemic brain tissue at risk of infarction, also known as penumbra, via its anti-excitatory effects. Furthermore, in a pilot first-in-human proof of concept study published in the journalJAMA Network Open, UCLA researchers developed an individualized method of  Cathodal tDCS deliveryonlyto the penumbral brain tissue using high-definition electrodes in patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke. They showed that cathodal direct current enhances blood flow in the ischemic region and salvages penumbra. They also observed a very high recanalization rate (occluded blood vessel opening) in the treated individuals, likely due to enhancement of blood flow. Therefore, given the available preclinical evidence and the promising UCLA researchers' work in humans, individualized delivery of Cathodal tDCS is a novel non-invasive acute ischemic stroke treatment strategy that can improve outcomes of acute stroke patients.Researchers at the UCLA Department of Neurology developed a non-invasive individualized method of delivering cathodal direct current stimulation to the ischemic brain tissue to treat acute ischemic stroke patients. The device includes a helmet embedded with several electrodes operable in combination and in an arrangement to deliver the electrical current to each individual's ischemic brain tissue using hemodynamic and perfusion imaging data. The device delivers a current between the plurality of electrodes when in contact with the patient's scalp. Acute ischemic stroke patients are then treated non-invasively and rapidly via neuroprotection, blood flow enhancement, and by promoting recanalization of the occluded vessels. The treatment can be applied in emergency rooms, hospital beds, and even en route to the hospital in ambulances. Furthermore, the device is the first-in-human individualized method to treat acute ischemic stroke.\u2022    Individualized treatment of acute ischemic stroke\u2022    Non-invasive bedside treatment of acute ischemic stroke\u2022    Promising benefits to treat acute ischemic stroke patients non-invasively\u2022Incorporating patients' imaging data to deliver anindividualized treatment to each patient's penumbral tissue\u2022    Bedside delivery of the treatment in a rapid, feasible manner",

However, current methods, such as transformers and charge pumps, are limited by size, high power losses, and electromagnetic interference, leading to voltage ripples.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers from the Department of Radiology have developed a novel needle-holding clamp for use during minimally invasive procedures.Background:Minimally invasive procedures are now widely used for diagnosing and treating subcutaneous and deep tissue targets. These procedures use percutaneous needle insertions rather than large incisions to access targets, and as such rely on image guidance for precise targeting of the intended tissues. Existing methods involve continuous monitoring through repeated imaging to ensure accurate targeting. These techniques use free-hand needle manipulations based on previous three-dimensional scans. This method can result in deviations from the intended trajectory due to factors including patient breathing, body movement, and tissue deformation. These degrees of freedom can result in poor targeting and prolonged procedures, potentially leading to complications and increased healthcare expenditures. There remains an unmet need for an accurate and minimally invasive needle control method that does not require continuous imaging monitoring for improved surgical outcomes.Innovation:UCLA researchers from the Department of Radiology have developed a novel needle-holding clamp with a built-in rolling sphere. The design of the clamp allows for precise control and stabilization of the needle during minimally invasive procedures. This innovation allows the needle to remain in its intended position and direction, preventing movement during monitoring and confirmation scans. The device provides an adjustable grip on needles with different sizes, minimizing deviation during procedures.

There is a growing emphasis on controlling injury-related bleeding through research and development in bioadhesives. Bioadhesives are substances or materials that bond living tissue together and are used in medical applications, such as wound closure and surgical adhesives. The key qualities of a good bioadhesive are strong bonding with tissues and high biocompatibility. However, many existing bioadhesives have several limitations, such as blood incompatibility, insufficient adhesion to wet surfaces, weak mechanical properties, and complex application procedures. Next-generation bioadhesives are needed to improve excessive bleeding in emergency healthcare.\n\nINNOVATION:The Annabi Lab at UCLA engineered a new bioadhesive that prevents bleeding in living tissue. This bioadhesive has strong mechanical properties that is fatigue-resistant, has robust adhesion to wet tissue within a few seconds, can adjust its shape to accommodate body movement, and stops bleeding efficiently.  Researchers engineered this hydrogel through a novel chemical process. They fine-tuned molecular interactions with different compounds to accomplish several things: build a primary molecular backbone of the hydrogel, create instant tissue-material interactions, strengthen its mechanical properties, enhance tissue adhesion in wet conditions, and create antioxidant and antibacterial properties for wound healing.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering developed a visible light crosslinkable hydrogel-based drug delivery platform that can achieve sustainable release of anti-inflammatory drug molecules to address unmet need of drug bioavailability in ocular injury treatment.\n\nBACKGROUND:The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that approximately 12 million people over the age of 40 in the United States have vision impairment. Ocular inflammations are commonly associated with eye diseases, injuries, and post-operative complications. Bacterial infection is a major cause of eye-related inflammations. Ophthalmic antibiotics are the most used topical treatment, but suffer from poor bioavailability, as less than 5% of a dose can be delivered to the posterior segment of eyes. Various ocular drug delivery methods, like intravitreal and oral injection, also have severe limitations and fail to achieve sustained release.\n\nEffective and sustained ocular delivery of therapeutics remains a challenge due to ocular physiology and structural barriers. So far, nanoparticles (NPs) have shown promising drug delivery outcomes. The NPs-based drug delivery systems can be composed of self-assembled proteins or peptides, synthetic block co-polymers, or lipids. However, current platforms designed specifically for ocular drug delivery show limited therapeutic efficacy due to several limitations in the delivery systems which lack required targeting effect, loading efficacy and doses, biocompatibility, etc.\n\nINNOVATION:UCLA researchers led by Dr. Nasim Annabi developed effective drug delivery platform for controlled and sustained release of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs. They achieved this goal by engineering a photocrosslinkable adhesive patch (termed GelPatch) which was incorporated with nanoparticles loaded with drug (such as anti-inflammatory drug molecules or antibiotics). This GelPatch allows drugs to penetrate the structural barriers of ocular tissues and provides a sustained release of drugs directly to the injured sites. This technology is biocompatible and affinitive to the stromal defected cornea. The GelPatch has strong tissue adhesion to ocular surfaces, enabling localized delivery of drug at the therapeutics doses, and has mechanical properties similar to the eye, avoiding mechanical mismatch and patient discomfort.\n\nThis technology solves the barrier of poor solubility of hydrophobic corticosteroids that was hindering its application. Such a drug delivery platform can be used for treatment of different ocular anterior segment diseases and injuries.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\nSlow and sustained release of therapeutics for treatment of ocular complicationsGelPatch has great potential to circumvent the drawbacks of contact lenses, microneedle patches, and other currently available adhesives in the market.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\nNoninvasive, highly adhesive, and biocompatibleDrug protection and sustained releaseLocal drug delivery at required dose.Lower dosage requirements to ensure better patient compliance\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:The idea of this invention started in August 2020.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA Researchers in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering have developed a method to tune perovskite crystal orientation for increased performance, energy efficiency, and reduced material defect with a variety of field applications, including solar cells and LEDs.Background:Perovskite holds considerable promise as a highly efficient base material in solar cells. Crystal structures are often at the core of perovskite thin films, due to their unique physical characteristics that can be adapted for specific use and detection. However, altering the molecular structure of a crystal to fit its intended use is costly and energy taxing. Current methods are also inconsistent across different crystal structures, causing defects in the material, inhibiting ideal electric and optical properties, and ultimately reducing performance. Further, current methods to resolve such defects rely on thermal energy, which can degrade the molecule, resulting in a sacrifice between increasing optimization versus experiencing degradation. Thus, there is an unmet need for controllable crystal orientation that can reproduce high quality crystal structures tuned for various applications uniformly.Innovation:Prof. Yang Yang and his research team have developed novel additive structures which can create high quality perovskite thin film with controllable crystal orientation. The additives can be tuned in absorption and orientation which boosts surface energy and crystal growth process. The resulting thin film has a high degree of structural order, controllable orientation, and an unbroken structure with little to no defects. The process has been proven to span a large range of perovskite crystal phases, with each phase being characterized with unique atomic arrangements and physical properties specialized for specific application. In demonstrations of the additive\u2019s peak intensity, the tuned molecules experience enhanced behaviors compared to the control and can attenuate phases to boost others. By tuning for specific crystal growth phases and in creating high quality film, a controllable nature of the perovskite structure is attained which is ideal to be modified for preferred functionality.

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCLA under the guidance of Drs. Matthew Rettig and Michael Jung have developed novel molecular compounds that reduce growth of prostate cancer cells. Dr. Jung in collaboration with Dr. Rettig have furthered the development of these compounds by synthesizing a new series of analogues that have similar inhibitory effects.\n\nBACKGROUND:Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men worldwide. Common treatment for prostate cancer includes hormone therapies like androgen deprivation therapy that reduce circulating levels of androgens to prevent androgen receptor (AR) activation in prostate cancer cells. Androgen deprivation therapy, however, is not effective in all patients. Approximately 20-30% of prostate cancer cases will progress to advanced, metastatic disease, with 10-20% of those patients developing castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC is an advanced form of prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormonal therapies traditionally used, generating more aggressive tumor growth and metastasis. A CRPC diagnosis results in very low survival outcomes, demonstrating a significant clinical challenge and an unmet need for alternative treatment strategies. AR directed therapy may play a pivotal role in addressing CRPC, as AR signaling is a key driver in CRPC progression. Importantly, the AR remains a key driver of castration resistant growth even upon disease progression after treatment with novel AR pathway inhibitors such as abiratereone and enzalutamide.\n\nINNOVATION:Dr. Matthew Rettig, Medical Director of the Prostate Cancer Program of the Institute of Urologic Oncology, and Dr. Michael Jung from the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry have identified novel compounds (UCLA technology reference number 2017-094) that can inhibit the AR. These compounds inhibit AR activity by covalently binding to the AR N-terminal transactivation domain and inducing its degradation in vitro and in vivo. The degradation inducing effects of these compounds are highly specific; for example, these compounds do not induce degradation of other steroid receptors such as the progesterone, estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors. In addition, these compounds inhibit growth of AR expressing (but not AR null) tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\nu2022Treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer\nu2022Combination therapy for advanced prostate cancer\nu2022Preventive therapy in high-risk populations\n\nADVANTAGES:\nu2022Does not inhibit the transcriptional activity of glucocorticoid receptors\nu2022Reduces expression in androgen receptor target genes\nu2022Androgen receptors are inhibited in a wide range of concentrations\nu2022Several analogues have been identified\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:in-vitro studies\n\nRelated paper (by the inventors only):Elshan, N.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery have developed a non-invasive method to disrupt biofilms on orthopaedic implants and decrease the overall rate of infections.Background:Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains a serious complication in hip and knee arthroplasty, with skyrocketing revision rates across all orthopaedic implants. The effective treatment of PJI is crucial to the overall success of these implants. Infections occur when a protective biofilm is formed over the orthopaedic implant. This biofilm protects the bacteria from immune reactions and allows the colonization to grow. Biofilms typically form when tissue regeneration at the bone-implant surface has not had enough time to develop. Orthopaedic implants are particularly prone to the growth of these biofilms due to material roughness, hydrophobicity, and surface charge. Typical orthopaedic implants utilize these features to promote bone regrowth; however, this also creates an environment primed for biofilm growth. Specifically, Staphylococcus epidermidis and aureus are the two most common infections that make up two-thirds of all infection cases. Treatment of these infections usually involves prescribed antibiotics; however, new strains are developing which are resistant to modern antibiotic treatments. To address these issues, a novel approach to infection treatments is pivotal to the ongoing success of hip and knee replacements.Innovation:UCLA researchers have developed an innovative, non-invasive method to treat orthopedic implants using iron-core nanoparticles and pulsed electromagnetic fields. This technique employs magnetic nanoparticles, which are set into oscillation by the magnetic field, to disrupt and break down biofilms that form on orthopedic implants. The mechanical disruption causes the biofilm to break down into smaller particles and detach from the implant, leaving it more susceptible to the body\u2019s natural immune response and antibodies. As a result, the implant surface becomes conducive to colonization by osteoblasts, promoting tissue regrowth and enhancing osseointegration.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers from the Department of Integrative Biology & Physiology have identified specific components of ketogenic diets that alter the microbiome and improve seizure resistance, providing valuable data to optimize diet treatments for refractory epilepsy.\n\nBACKGROUND:Refractory epilepsy, a disease characterized by uncontrolled seizures, is particularly hard to treat as this condition is resistant to antiepileptic drugs. Recently, the ketogenic diet, which is high in fats and low in carbohydrates, is used to treat refractory epilepsy in children. However, prescribed ketogenic diets vary in macronutrient composition and result in variability in patient response to the diet. Previous research has shown that the microbiome, the collection of all microbes in the human body, plays an important role in the anti-seizure effects of the ketogenic diet. In fact, alterations in the gut microbiome may lead to the observed patient variability in response to the ketogenic diet. However, how this diet mechanistically prevents seizures is yet to be uncovered.\n\nINNOVATION:UCLA researchers have identified specific dietary fibers that correspond to increased seizure resistance in a mouse model. They screened multiple clinical ketogenic diet (KD) infant formulas in a mouse model of epilepsy and found that different formulas were accompanied by differential seizure responses and altered the gut microbiome. Furthermore, researchers identified types of dietary fiber in the KD that caused changes to the microbiome and promoted seizure resistance. Additionally, they identified microbial metagenomic signatures linked to fiber supplementation, allowing them to identify potential biomarkers for seizure resistance. This provides valuable data to manufacture KDs with specific formulations to optimally prevent seizures in refractory epilepsy.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\nManipulating gut microbiome to treat refractory epilepsy or drug-resistant epilepsy\nRefining prescribed ketogenic diets to include particular fiber types that lead to seizure resistance\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\nKetogenic diets are already approved and used to treat refractory epilepsy, so refining their composition to be more effective is much more efficient than creating a new drug\nManipulating the gut microbiome is very clinically feasible, as most drugs are taken orally\nKetogenic diets are used for other metabolic disorders, so understanding how they impact the microbiome can be valuable to link to other treatments\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:UCLA researchers have identified differential formulations of ketogenic diets in impacting the gut microbiome and inducing seizure resistance in epilepsy.",

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that Nisin is a safe antimicrobial and has a low potential for developing bacterial resistance. Indeed, the research of Nisin for the use of clinical diseases is expansive and ranges from Alzheimer\u2019s, inflammation to periodontal disease. A barrier into leveraging the properties of Nisin for the treatment of disease is finding the correct drug delivery system.\n\nINNOVATION:Researchers led by Dr. Yvonne Kapila have incorporated Nisin into a nanoscale drug delivery system called Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN). These SLNs are nanoparticles created from biocompatible lipids. They are highly stable for over a year while also having low transient toxicityin vivo. The Kapila group constructed Nisin-loaded SLN (SLN-Nisin) and has shown that SLN-Nisin amplifies antibacterial effects by 2 times, antimicrobial effects by 4 times and anticancer properties by 10 times when compared to free Nisin. In Alzheimer\u2019s disease, data from the Kapila group indicate that Nisin can significantly reduce two proteins involved in Alzheimer\u2019s disease progression, the amyloid plaques and Tau proteins, in the brains of mice with polymicrobial periodontal infections. The use of Nisin shows that there is a significant reduction in neuroinflammatory markers in the brain, indicating the use of Nisin for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s. Nisin also reduces NAFLD parameters (fatty liver, liver inflammation, microbiome changes).\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\nDelivery of Nisin at high efficacy rates.Nisin delivery can be used for multiple disease states including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, periodontal disease, NAFLDIncrease therapeutic efficacy of Nisin by using SLN-Nisin.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\nNisin can be delivered alone, or in formulations, vehicles, scaffolds, membranes, or in nano-sized delivery systems to treat multiple diseases and inflammation.Encapsulation of Nisin amplifies its antibacterial, antibiofilm, anticancer and antiinflammation properties.\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:Researchers produced SLN-Nisin by the microemulsion extrusion technique, as well as created the Nisin formulation in vehicles and scaffolds.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics have developed a novel method to produce short lentiviral vectors with tissue-specific expression, with a primary focus on lentiviral vectors for treating sickle cell disease and other disorders of hemoglobin.\n\nBACKGROUND:Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders worldwide and is a major cause of morbidity and early mortality. SCD is cause by a single amino acid change in \u03b2-globin which leads to hemoglobin polymerization and red blood cell sickling. Although SCD is well characterized, there is still no ideal long-term treatment. Current therapies are based on induction of fetal hemoglobin to inhibit polymerization of sickle hemoglobin or transfusions to reduce the percentage of sickle hemoglobin. Stem cell transplantation is a promising technique but its reliance on a sibling donor significantly limits its widespread use. Transplantation of allogeneic cells is high risk due to graft versus-host disease. Recently, gene therapy has emerged as a potential treatment, with lentiviral vectors as gene delivery modalities showing the most promise. Unfortunately, current \u03b2-globin expression vectors suffer from low vector titer and sub-optimal gene transfer, limiting the advancement of this gene therapy to the clinic.\n\nINNOVATION:UCLA researchers have developed novel LVs for the treatment of SCD. These vectors are considerably smaller, up to half the number of base pairs of previous examples. Shorter vectors have higher titer, more complete packaged genomes, and better infectivity. Administration of early versions of these vectors resulted in 18.5% of total hemoglobin tetramers at week 20 (more than 10% provides therapeutic effect) in a mouse model of SCD. These optimized and shortened LVs with erythroid-specific enhancers, provided up to a 10-fold higher titer with superior gene transfer to hematopoietic stem cells while retaining robust expression levels. These enhanced vectors are particularly important in clinical situations where poor gene transfer to hematopoietic stem cells is an issue. Translation of this LV-based gene therapy to the clinic would be facilitated by lower costs due to higher titer and gene transfer. The methods developed in order to design these new shorter LVs can be translated to many other untreatable, chronic diseases.\n\nAPPLICATIONS:\nSickle cell disease treatment\nTreatment of hemoglobinopathies (e.g. Beta-thalassemia)\nExpress other transgenes in erythrocytes, e.g. ADA, IDUA\nApply to development of lentiviral vectors with expression specificity for other cell lineages (e.g. white blood cells, platelets, T cells, muscle, liver, neurons, etc.) to treat other diseases\n\nADVANTAGES:\nShort vector length\nLineage-specific enhancers\nShort sequence DNA enhancers\nImproved titer and gene transfer\nEfficient lentiviral vectors",

In addition, medical facilities with low nurse to patient ratios can generate miscommunications that may lead to catastrophic medical outcomes.

Traditional approaches to tubal sterilization rely on invasive surgery in which the fallopian tubes are either cut, cauterized, or clipped. These existing methods are also hindered by several limitations, including the need for general anesthesia, risk of potential complications, and significant recovery time. Recent developments in surgical technologies have improved the safety and efficacy of this procedure but are still limited by procedural complexity and increased risk of adverse reactions. There remains an unmet clinical need for a minimally invasive tubal sterilization technique.Innovation:UCLA researchers from the Department of Radiological Sciences have developed a novel image-guided technique for effective and minimally invasive tubal sterilization. This technology involves the use of a dual lumen microcatheter to deliver a surgical adhesive into the fallopian tube. The adhesive facilitates formation of scar tissue within the tube, which results in durable and long-term occlusion.

    "ip_description": "Summary:Researchers in the Mechanical Engineering Department at UCLA developed an innovative mechatronic system that can perform fast and accurate pressure regulation during cataract surgeries.Background:Despite being generally safe and successful, cataract surgery has a complication rate of about 6%, which is concerning given the high volume of procedures. Maintaining a specific intraocular pressure (IOP) level during eye surgery is crucial for anatomical integrity and safety. The current method employed in this type of surgery creates pressure disturbances within the eye, which can cause deformation and damage to intraocular tissues.  Fluid control machines that have been developed for other types of eye surgery are not well suited for cataract surgery, and do not provide a rapid enough response time. Therefore, there is a critical need for an IOP regulation system with small pressure excursions and a fast settling time to effectively mitigate surge phenomena.Innovation:UCLA researchers have developed an innovative mechatronic system and control algorithm that can perform fast and accurate intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation. The invention includes an independent irrigation and aspiration system that can be integrated with current fluid control machines. This system employs a dual-pump mechanism that creates a feedback loop for the developed software, allowing four actuators to precisely control IOP levels using three advanced control strategies: IOP regulation without pulsatile flows, pulsatile aspiration, and pulsatile irrigation. This system has shown a 50% decrease in surge peak time, a 74% decrease in maximum pressure, and a 75% decrease in settling time.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Bioengineering have developed a computational imaging method that enables detection of 3D light signals using only a single camera sensor area for optimized surgical visualization.Background:Surgical procedures necessitate high precision imaging, especially when targeting specific anatomical structures. Current preoperative planning includes imaging from MRI, CT and ultrasound scans. These images may not reflect the dynamic changes that occur during the surgery, which can result in a technician's reliance on visual cues and feedback. This is especially problematic in procedures like craniotomies, where brain deformation makes preoperative images unreliable for locating structures. Fluorescent dyes have been introduced to aid real-time identification of targets. Imaging of wavelengths that offer the best visualization, such as the second near-infrared region (NIR-II), may be limited to 2D visualization, which is inadequate for comprehensive tissue imaging. NIR-II imaging offers advantages including reduced autofluorescence and the ability to image in deeper, softer tissues for applications such as tumor detection. However, there remains an unmet need for a novel, 3D imaging method enabling precise, real-time visualization capabilities for high stakes surgical procedures.Innovation:UCLA researchers have developed a novel method titled Squeezed Light Field Microscopy (SLIM) to enable precise 3D imaging in real time in the NIR-II window. SLIM leverages computational imaging to provide high-resolution 3D images using a single, low-resolution camera sensor. This imaging modality is capable of depth retrieval, post-capture refocusing and extended depth of field, all necessary for surgical precision.

These applications require wireless network systems that can transfer massive amounts of data very quickly to be practical. While 5G communication networks have been used successfully in these applications, they will not be able to scale with the data transfer speeds required for ultra-high data networking. Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology can potentially provide this connectivity by operating over a large bandwidth in the high-frequency spectrum. However, mmWave technology operates over a narrow beam and is easily obstructed by objects like walls and people. There is an urgent need to develop new mmWave relay systems that can be deployed rapidly, support multiple users, and are power efficient.Innovation:Researchers led by Assistant Professor Omid Abari in the Department of Computer Science have developed mmXtend, a low-power, low-cost repeater system that can provide high data rate connectivity for mmWave applications. In a scenario where the line of sight between a base station and user is blocked, mmXtend steers the beam from the base station to its intended user. In addition to being mounted on the roof or walls of a building, mmXtend is lightweight enough to be mounted onto a drone system for outdoor applications. The system operates in the 26.5 GHz to 29.5 GHz range, enabling rapid data transfer.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a novel preprocessing algorithm to purify imperceptibly poisoned training datasets that may lead to misclassification and maintain image quality.Background:Large datasets are important for the effectiveness of machine learning models, serving as the main tool for the training of algorithms. Unfortunately, even a small number of poisoned images covertly inserted into these sets can cause significant harm and result in misclassifications and compromised integrity of the entire model. These poisoned images have been remarkably adept at manipulating deep learning systems and pose a big threat across sectors heavily reliant on artificial intelligence (AI), such as healthcare, security, finance, and autonomous vehicles.Poisoned attacks typically come in two forms: triggered and triggerless. Triggered attacks embed imperceptible trigger patterns within training data, resulting in the misclassification of test-time sample containing these concealed triggers. In contrast, triggerless attacks introduce subtle perturbations to individual images, subtly changing their classification and subsequently resulting in incorrect classifications. Given AI\u2019s growing critical role, safeguarding model integrity is paramount. Existing defense strategies often compromise performance, offer limited protection, or impose excessive computational burdens. There is, thus, an urgent need for robust defense mechanisms capable of countering imperceptible poisons without compromising efficiency or imposing excessive computational overhead. Addressing this need is crucial for ensuring continued success of AI models in real-world applications and instilling trust in these machine learning models.Innovation:UCLA researchers have developed a preprocessing algorithm that purifies adversarially poisoned training datasets to enable robust deep learning classifier training. This purifying energy-based model (PureEBM) utilizes the learned energy landscape of an energy-based model (EBM) to identify poisoned data points characterized by high energy levels and subsequently purify them towards the natural data manifold. The PureEBM works through a random process to clean up purified data by iteratively adjusting the data to make it similar to normal, clean data, while preserving image quality. Notably, this model requires no prior knowledge of the poison attack or classifier model to be successful. The key innovation in this technology lies in its ability to purify unnoticed attacks, target both triggered and triggerless attacks, and uphold image integrity throughout the purification process. This innovation thus has the potential to ensure AI models maintain integrity in the presence of poisoned images.Potential Applications:\u2022    Machine Learning Systems\u2022    Network Security Systems for protection against cyber attacks\u2022    Online healthcare systems to protect medical data and patient confidentiality\u2022    Online information services for protecting the integrity and privacy of customer/ financial data\u2022    Watermarking and copyright protection\u2022    Defense applicationsAdvantages:\u2022    Effectively purifies state-of-the-art poison attacks while preserving high natural accuracy with no required prior knowledge of the poison attack\u2022    Targets both triggerless and triggered poison attacks without significant time investments\u2022    Preserves image quality following EBM purification, ensuring high quality training dataDevelopment-To-Date:First successful demonstration of the invention completed June 2023.",

    "published_date": "2021",
    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCLA\u2019s Department of Neurology and Drug Discovery Lab have identified a novel set of biomarkers that change based on levels of Cognitive Fatigue (CF). These biomarkers can be used to non-invasively predict and assess levels of cognitive fatigue.\n\nBACKGROUND: Cognitive fatigue (CF) is an important factor in the efficiency and safety of performance-dependent tasks. CF-associated changes in overall physical state, reflect alterations in both cell signaling processes and biochemistry. It is postulated that the degree of CF experienced by an individual may be reflected by biomarkers in biofluids, such as saliva. Neuronal innervation of the salivary gland results in secretion of neuron-derived exosomes into saliva, while harboring signal molecules (proteins, lipids, mRNA, miRNA, DNA) that are indicative of changes in the cellular and molecular landscape of the central nervous system.\n\nUnderstanding and accurately assessing CF levels is of great interest to a variety of sectors where operators are tasked with high-risk or high-cognitive load tasks requiring the user to execute with minimal mistakes. These sectors include but are not limited to the military, medicine, aviation, and finance. However, quantifying levels of CF is difficult and typical cognitive tests may be misleading as they can be memorized and habituated, in addition to taking valuable time to perform. As a result, there is a need for non-invasive methods of quantifying cognitive fatigue, and which can\u2019t be altered by the user or biased by the administrator.\n\nINNOVATION: UCLA researchers in the departments of Neurology and the Drug Discovery Lab have elucidated protein and microRNA biomarkers that vary significantly with CF in salivary neuronal exosomes. With these findings, they developed a novel panel of biomarkers for non-invasively assessing levels of CF. The biomarker panel was created and optimized on brain-derived exosomes which appear on saliva because of various brain-connected nerves and tissue layers innervating the salivary gland. These biomarkers rely on exosomes, small membrane-bound vesicles which can be readily found in the saliva.\n\nThis is the first discovery of a catalog of molecular predictors of cognitive fatigue present in saliva exosomes. The inclusion of various both miRNA and proteins in this panel, allows for two different approaches to assessing CF. Additionally, the panel contains markers that move in both directions, increasing or decreasing as CF goes up. By assessing CF on multiple fronts, miRNA, protein, increase/decrease, this panel provides a wholistic assessment of CF that is quantifiable and limitedly biased by user physiology. These biomarkers can be utilized in various situations to de-risk operators/user performance before performing high-risk or high-cognitive load tasks. Understanding these changes will enable development of training programs that enhance pilot cognitive endurance.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\nDetecting Cognitive Fatigue (CF) as a result of a particular event\nAssessing CF as a basis of time\nAssessing CF of operators in high-risk positions (e.g. fighter pilots, surgeons, patients)\nAid in the development of cockpit devices and training programs to reduce CF in high-cognitive load tasks\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\nNon-invasive\nRelies on brain-derived exosomes\nPanel of various biomarkers\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE: The project was initiated in September 2017 funded by a grant from the US Air Force. A panel of biomarkers has been developed based on a cohort which underwent a 12-hour cognitively fatiguing event. Publication in an academic journal was successful in 2022.\n\nRelated Papers (from the inventors only): Cohn, W., Zhu, C., Campagna, J., Bilousova, T., Spilman, P., Teter, B., ... & John, V. (2022).

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, in collaboration with Hannover Medical School in Germany, have developed a host-directed therapeutic agent targeting mammalian deoxycytidine kinase to prevent, treat, and even cure any local and systemic infectious diseases in human and animal hosts.\n\nBACKGROUND:Many clinically relevant bacterial pathogens have already developed resistance mechanisms against the most common and even last-resort drugs employed today. Hospital- and community-acquired infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens represent a global public health threat. According to the 2019 antibiotic resistance threat report by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur in the United States each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result. This emergency is being amplified by the rapid exchange of antibiotic resistance genes via horizontal gene transfer events along with the large-scale usage of antimicrobials in hospitals and in livestock industry.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus,orS. aureus, aGram-positive bacterium, is a notorious pathogen that colonizes approximately 30% of the human population. It causes skin and soft tissue infections and is a very common cause of endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and bacteremia. In human immune systems, neutrophils combatS. aureusby inducing phagocytosis, producing reactive oxygen species, and making neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).S. aureusrapidly evades NETs by secreting a potent nuclease, Nuc, capable of disrupting these structures. The Nuc-mediated degradation of NETs, apart from promoting immune evasion, leads to the release of deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates which are then converted into deoxyribonucleosides, such as deoxyadenosine (dAdo) and deoxyguanosine (dGuo). These deoxyribonucleosides disrupt the purine salvage pathway and trigger apoptosis of the host immune cells. Thus, novel methods inhibiting deoxyribonucleoside-mediated cell death could provide new tools for tackling and treating infections byS. aureusand other bacteria.\n\nINNOVATION:UCLA researchers led by Dr. Caius Radu in the Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology have developed a novel host-directed therapeutic agent to treat local and/or systemicS. aureusinfection in human or animal hosts. The researchers synthesized a family of compounds that evidenced oral activity and potent inhibition of mammalian deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), an enzyme involved in the early steps of the nucleotide salvage pathway in immune cells. They saw that this inhibition is effective at boosting macrophage survival during acute and persistent infections. Inin vitrohuman cell lines andin vivomurine models, the researchers demonstrated that administration of the  DCK inhibitor successfully rescued dAdo/dGuo-mediated macrophage cell death and cleared abscess formation by the bacteria. This DCK inhibitor and its derivatives could provide a much-needed therapeutic tool to combat drug-resistant bacterial infections.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\nThis therapeutic method could prevent, attenuate, treat, or cure any local and/or systemic infectious diseases in human or animal hosts, preferably but not limited to an infection caused byS. aureusand its methicillin-resistant or vancomycin-resistant variants.\nThese molecules can be used in combination with othertherapeutic method to treat against another infectious pathogen, such asStaphylococcus pseudintermedius, or polymicrobial infections\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\nThe host-directed compound is FDA-approved and safe in humans\nOral administration allows for easy use in clinical settings\nBroad spectrum activity against multi-resistant bacterial pathogens\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:The therapeutic efficacy of the compounds were successfully demonstrated in human cell line and mouse disease models.\n\nPATENT: US9981961B2\n\nRelated Papers (from the inventors only)\n\nAbt, E.

To address this, water recycling and desalination efforts have been intensely pursued. However, concentrated brines and seawater used in reverse osmosis (RO), a primary technology for desalination, can quickly cause scaling and fouling on membranes.

Soft actuators generally operate by converting input stimuli into useful mechanical outputs. Phase change materials (PCMs) are an attractive component of actuation systems as they can display shape memory with actuation stemming from the dielectric elastomeric properties. PCMs provide materials the capability to change their physical states when triggered by heat. Specifically, stretchable Joule heating electrodes (JHEs) are used to induce the phase change needed for expansion or contraction of the material. Previous JHEs have been fabricated from a wide range of materials, but most were only reported to be bendable and could not retain their resistance at high strains. There is a demonstrated need for a JHE material that would allow strains greater than 100% and be stable to Joule heating at  such strain levels.Innovation:UCLA researchers led by Professor Qibing Pei have developed a new, stretchable, patternable JHE material capable of maintaining the same operating voltage at actuated and relaxed states over more than 20,000 cycles. The researchers demonstrated that strains up to 100% did not affect the resistance of the JHE and applied voltages between 7 and 8 V increased the temperature of the material past the phase change transition temperature.

During transmission, data is combined using generator polynomials to produce an encoded output sequence, including redundant segments to assist with error detection at the receiver. The Viterbi Algorithm is commonly used to decode these received CCs into understandable and interpretable data. However, the Viterbi Algorithm's complexity increases exponentially with the length of the redundant segments, making it challenging to balance error detection and high-speed signal processing. Therefore, new decoding algorithms are needed to enhance both error detection and processing speed.Innovation:Researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a novel decoding algorithm that significantly reduces complexity compared to the standard Viterbi Algorithm.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology have discovered that irradiation therapy can be combined with an antibody drug conjugate to form a novel therapeutic strategy to treat and extend survival of glioblastoma patients.\n\nBACKGROUND:Glioblastoma (GBM) is a fast-growing and aggressive brain tumor. The National Brain Tumor Society estimated that over 14,000 people in the United States received a GBM diagnosis in 2023. GBM\u2019s account for an estimated 50% of all primary malignant brain tumors and survival is poor, with only a 40% survival rate after the first year of diagnosis and 17% in the second year. GBMs are difficult to treat due to the localization of the tumors within the brain and the limited capacity of the brain to repair itself and malignant cells migrating to adjacent brain tissue, among other factors. Current treatments include the chemotherapy agent temozolomide (TMZ) or the use of irradiation (IR). These treatment options transiently halt tumor growth but do not induce cell death. Research has shown that certain GBM cells have an increased expression for BCL-xL, which prevents cancer cell death. UCLA researchers have previously shown that combining TMZ/IR with BCL-xL inhibitions leads to increased GBM cell death in a laboratory setting but work remains to show the clinical efficacy of targeting BCL-xL.\n\nINNOVATION:UCLA researchers led by Dr. David Nathanson aimed to successfully target BCL-xL. Platelets have a high dependency on BCL-xL for survival and treatment with BH3, a BCL-xL inhibitor, leads to thrombocytopenia. UCLA researchers circumvented these issues by using ABBV-155, an antibody drug conjugate, to deliver a potent BCL-xL inhibitor to GBM cells. ABBv-155 delivers a drug through an antibody specific for the B7H3 protein, which is highly expressed in GBM and other cancers. Research showed that combining ABV-155 with IR effectively induces cell death in glioblastoma cells and is a promising therapeutic strategy.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\nTreatment for glioblastomas that can decrease number of GBM cells by causing cell death.\nTreatment for other cancers with high BCL-xL expression.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\nTarget GBM cells without inducing thrombocytopenia.\nCombination of ABV-155 with IR decreased tumor growth and extended survival\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:B7H3 was shown to be highly expressed in GBM autopsy samples.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers from the School of Dentistry have developed zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) nanoparticles-based implant coating system for the controlled release of therapeutics.Background:One of the most significant advancements in clinical dentistry over the past four decades is the development of osteointegrated dental implants. These implants have become a routine and reliable solution for replacing teeth in both completely and partially edentulous patients. Various surface modifications have been explored to enhance therapeutic effects, with implants designed to stimulate bone formation (osteoinduction) and ensure seamless integration with the body (osteointegration). This process relies on the coordinated release of growth factors and peptides, which are incorporated into the implant through surface coatings. However, current coatings face limitations: they cannot store sufficient quantities of bioactive molecules and only offer a limited release. Additionally, dental implants are prone to periimplantitis, the most common inflammatory complication in implantology. This condition leads to bone loss around the implant and, if untreated, to the loss of the implant itself. Described recently as a \"time bomb,\" peri-implantitis represents a serious complication. Present technologies fail to prevent this disease, highlighting a critical unmet need for an implant coating that can deliver a sustained and long-term release of bioactive molecules to support bone formation and growth.Innovation:Researchers at UCLA's School of Dentistry have developed innovative nanoparticles based on Zeolite Imidazole Framework-8 (ZIF-8) for use in dental implant coatings. These coatings are infused with bioactive molecules that promote bone mineralization. Titanium-based dental implants coated with these biomolecule-loaded nanoparticles have demonstrated enhanced cell adhesion and reduced inflammation. Additionally, the coating offers antibacterial properties that combat bacteria responsible for peri-implantitis. The chemical and physical properties of the coating ensure stability for the biomolecules, maintaining their integrity under high temperatures and pressures. This versatile system can be adapted to a wide range of implants, providing a long-term and sustained release of various biomolecules presenting a novel preventive and treatment modality for periimplantitis which is the most common dental implant disease.Credit: Alireza MoshaveriniaPotential Applications:\u2022    Dental implants\u2022    Bone screws\u2022    Biomedical devices\u2022    Orthopedic implantsAdvantages:\u2022    Novel preventive and treatment modality for periimplantitis\u2022    Enhanced bioactivity\u2022    Immunomudolatory properties\u2022    Antibacterial properties\u2022    Sustained release of growth factors and bioactive molecules\u2022    Stability\u2022    BiocompatibilityDevelopment-To-Date:The first demonstration of the invention is complete (08/01/2022).Reference:UCLA Case No. 2023-141Lead Inventor:Alireza Moshaverinia",

Only a few nanometers wide, GNRs have unique properties that distinguish them from graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes. For example, GNRs can display semiconducting behavior and their electronic properties can be tuned by controlling the precise geometry of the lattice structure. They can also be used in energy storage applications, sensor development, and quantum computing., To realize this potential, there is an unmet need to develop rational methodologies for designing and synthesizing GNRs, which currently rely on top-down design approaches (i.e., reverse engineering) that suffer from inconsistent final geometries.Innovation:Researchers in the Physical Sciences Division and Electrical and Computer Engineering Department have developed a new class of GNRs with unique topology induced by an electric stimulus. This bottom-up approach uses monomer precursors to produce chevron-shaped GNRs. Compared to standard top-down approaches, bottom-up design offers numerous advantages. These include atomic-level precision, improved manufacturing control & synthesis, scalability, cost efficiency, and the potential to design materials for novel properties. Importantly, the boundary states between the GNR features can be predicted and physically adjusted by simply altering the direction of the electric field.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a novel computational hardware that combines stochastic computing with compute-in-memory techniques that improves speed and computational efficiency.Background:In recent years, the need for advanced computational technologies has surged, driven by applications requiring intensive data processing such as machine learning and deep neural networks. Stochastic computing (SC) is attractive for neural network acceleration as it requires less space than traditional methods. This is because the hardware is simpler and thus more cost effective, energy efficient and scalable. However, the limited accuracy of SC, tied to the inherent randomness in its computation process, has hindered its widespread adoption. Compute-in-memory (CIM) technologies aim to reduce data movement by performing computations directly within memory arrays, although they are limited by the need for power-hungry analog-to-digital converters. If the advantages of each technology could be combined, adoption would increase, enabling cheaper, more efficient computing.Innovation:UCLA researchers have developed Stochastic Computing in Memory (SCIM) with Range-Extended Stochastic Computing (REX-SC), which addresses the accuracy limitations of traditional SC by integrating SC with CIM techniques. REX-SC enhances computation accuracy without compromising the performance benefits of previous stochastic methods. By increasing the number of output bits after accumulation while maintaining the compactness of SC compute units, REX-SC significantly narrows the accuracy gap compared to fixed-point computations. This innovative approach ensures both the reduction in power and area overhead typically associated with CIM and the improved accuracy required for complex machine learning models.Potential Applications:\u2022    Deep neural network acceleration\u2022    Image recognition systems\u2022    Voice recognition systems\u2022    Machine translation services\u2022    Energy-efficient computingAdvantages:\u2022    Higher computational accuracy \u2013 improvements of 3-8% over previous technologies.\u2022    Reduced energy consumption \u2013 up to 3.6x energy reduction.\u2022    Minimal area and power overhead.\u2022    Lower data movement requirements.\u2022    Scalability to large models.State of Development:The circuit has been designed and demonstrated in simulation.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an event within the spectrum of cardiovascular disease that demands rapid and accurate diagnosis. AMI is commonly detected using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) assays, which quantify the blood levels of proteins associated with myocardial damage. Existing techniques are costly and bulky, require skilled and trained operators, and have long turnaround times. This limits the use of such assays, particularly in remote and low-income regions, which have a higher prevalence of AMI.

Disposable supplies can be packaged in layers of plastic wrap, cardboard, and tamper-proof contraptions. Currently, there is no accepted standard for dealing with this wide array of packaging. As a result, nurses will frequently use their nails, keys, or other tools that may not be suited for the healthcare setting and can introduce contamination. Through a survey of nurses in Los Angeles, many indicated a willingness to try using a tool specifically designed to open packages in a medical setting. The time spent handling packaging reduces the time available to care for patients. This issue is compounded by the growing nursing shortage that is projected to grow as our population ages. Therefore, it is vital that hospitals and clinics provide nursing staff with cost-effective tools to optimize their work.Innovation:UCLA researchers led by Veronica Pellegrino developed a two-piece system to aid nurses in opening packages.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the Department of Radiology have developed a novel method for obtaining simultaneous perfusion and functional MRI data from a single MRI acquisition to improve the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of brain tumors and stroke.\n\nAdvanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are crucial for the diagnosis and management of neurological conditions. In brain tumor and stroke, for example, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion MRI is performed with the use of contrast agents to quantify brain vascularity, blood flow, and other measures of perfusion. Separately, resting-state functional MRI, based on the principles of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)-based MR contrast mechanisms, is an emerging tool to understand insights into brain activity and function. While resting-state fMRI is a potentially valuable tool for patient care and understanding neurological function, it currently requires fMRI-trained neuroradiologists and MRI technologists, lengthy or complicated data processing, and additional scan time. These limitations render the imaging inaccessible to most patients and limit it to select cases at top-tier academic medical centers. There is a clear need for a method to estimate resting-state fMRI data, potentially using standard-of-care MRI techniques, to enable widespread availability.\n\nResearchers led by Dr. Benjamin Ellingson have developed a method that allows technicians to obtain simultaneous perfusion and fMRI data in the same patients. This method operates by modeling and subsequently removing the perfusion signal created by the contrast agent. This improvement enables the collection of a \u201cpseudo\u201d resting-state fMRI signal simultaneously with standard-of-care perfusion MRI, potentially allowing for concurrent estimation of perfusion-based measurements (e.g. blood volume, blood flow, mean transit time, percent signal recovery) along with resting-state fMRI measurements that relate to neurological function (e.g. network-based functional connectivity, seed-to-voxel connectivity, BOLD asynchrony, etc.). Thus, thus method has the potential to provide a new standard of care for MRI exams involving patients with brain tumors, stroke, and other neurological diseases that require perfusion MRI evaluations.\n\n\u2022    Neurological disorders (brain tumors, stroke, traumatic brain injury, cognitive impairment, Alzheimer\u2019s disease)\n\u2022    Cognitive neuroscience\n\n\u2022    Cost effectiveness\n\u2022    Shorter scan times\n\u2022    Clinical integration\n\u2022    Clinical accessibility\n\u2022    Quantitative assessment\n\nMethod has been validated in a study of 24 glioma survivors with resting-state functional MRI, dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI, and cognitive impairment status, which was accepted in the American Journal of Neuroradiology. The study found that resting-state network mapping of the clinically-relevant motor and language networks and the neuroscience research-relevant default mode network is possible using the pseudo-resting-state functional MRI technique, and these image maps have good agreement with actual resting-state functional MRI. The pseudo-resting-state functional MRI technique was also able to predict the cognitive impairment status of these patients with similar performance to resting-state functional MRI. Ongoing work has also involved using the pseudo-resting-state functional MRI technique for more advanced resting-state analyses techniques, including graph theory and BOLD asynchrony.\n\nCho NS, Wang C, Van Dyk K, Sanvito F, Oshima S, Yao J, Lai A, Salamon N, Cloughesy TF, Nghiemphu PL, Ellingson BM.

The success of virtual and augmented reality (AR) is dependent on creating a truly immersive environment for the user. Creating realistic visual stimuli is possible, but other virtual senses remain stunted. Haptic feedback, for example, is a key component of immersion, providing tactile sensations to users, enabling true interaction with the virtual environment. However, advances in haptic devices have not kept pace with VR/AR development. Conventional haptics use mechanically complex actuators, which are limited in their force and displacement output. A device with limited outputs may not accurately simulate the sensation that a user might be expecting, diminishing the realism of the VR experience. Current devices tend to be reliant on auxiliary equipment, as well, hindering the seamless integration of haptic feedback into VR/AR systems. A wearable haptic device that can fully replicate tactile feedback will catapult virtual reality systems to the next level of realism.Innovation:UCLA researchers have developed a haptic feedback array in a patch-like form factor that is capable of higher force output and displacement than traditional haptics without the need for secondary operational equipment. This may enhance the overall user experience and allow for more realistic sensations. The haptic devices can be fabricated in different shapes and sizes to create different feedback systems without any increase in manufacturing complexity and while remaining lightweight and wearable.

Existing technologies for measuring IR radiation rely on either photodetection or thermal detection. The former relies on semiconducting materials that generate an electrical current when exposed to IR radiation, which is measured to determine radiation intensity. These detectors are limited in terms of sensitivity and costs. The latter relies on measuring the heating effect of IR radiation on a material. Such technologies suffer from sensitivity and stability issues. Both approaches require cryogenic cooling to achieve high sensitivity, which increases costs and stability complications. There remains an unmet need for a highly sensitive method of measuring IR radiation that does not require cryogenic cooling.Innovation:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a highly sensitive method for measuring infrared radiation without the need for cryogenic cooling. This technology uses optomechanical oscillators integrated with transduction elements to collect external radiation.

SSPN is critical for the function of adhesion complexes in skeletal and cardiac muscle. For instance, loss of adhesion complex function results in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Studies have also shown that overexpression of SSPN can ameliorate skeletal muscle, cardiac, and respiratory dysfunction in DMD murine models making it a promising therapeutic target. High quality SSPN antibodies are needed for basic research of SSPN interactions and translation research of SSPN-based therapy development. However, current commercially available anti-SSPN antibodies are unreliable as they exhibit significant cross-reactivity leading to high background staining. Thus, highly specific SSPN antibodies are in high demand for various fields of basic and translational biology.\n\nINNOVATION:Researchers at UCLA have generated a novel set of antibodies that recognize human and mouse SSPN protein with superior specificity to current commercially available antibodies. The antibodies were developed against three distinct epitopes of SSPN protein: N-terminus, large extracellular loop and C-terminus. Researchers successfully generated rabbit monoclonal antibodies against mouse SSPN protein and found to be effective for the use in ELISA, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescent analysis even in low SSPPN-abundance samples. Researchers also generated mouse monoclonal antibodies for the recognition of human protein with high affinity and specificity for use in immunofluorescent analysis. No background signal was detected in SSPN null tissues. Human-specific antibodies were also able to detect native SSPN in patient muscle samples. These sets of antibodies demonstrated superior specificity and reactivity to SSPN compared to commercially available antibodies.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\nUnique research tool for basic and translational research in tetraspanin biology for the application of immunofluorescent analysis, immunoblotting, ELISA and immunoprecipitation.Reagent for the use of biomarker detection\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\nSuperior specificity and minimal background compared to current antibodiesDetection of native protein in human and mouse tissue\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:\n\nDeveloped a new panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to SSPN of mouse and human origin.

Large gamma scintillators are used in industrial screening at ports of entry to monitor radiation in luggage and shipping containers, requiring scintillating materials with low natural radioactive backgrounds. By contrast, medical image applications rely on very fast scintillators that can precisely localize the line path of positrons in positron emission tomography (PET). While some commercial scintillators exist for these applications individually, no material has both a low natural radioactive background and very fast emission times. There is a need for new scintillation materials to overcome these challenges simultaneously.Innovation:Professor Qibing Pei and colleagues in UCLA\u2019s Department of Materials Science and Engineering have developed a new composite scintillation material that incorporates high atomic number nanoparticles into a plastic matrix. The percentage of nanoparticles in the matrix can be tuned based on the desired application.

Mobile computing utilizes portable devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables, which are highly dependent on efficient communication schemes with its users. In the realm of typing, efforts have been made to use smaller keyboards with less than 26 keys, for example, T9 typing. Implementing these schemes into everyday mobile computing devices, however, has encountered obstacles due to impracticalities. Predictive text and AI innovations have improved these efforts, but these methods still can be challenging to use and require users to manually select desired words, effectively defeating their purported benefits and rendering them obsolete. Existing technologies are hampered by the need to map 30 or more different brain signals from the user to the letters of the English alphabet and some punctuation marks. The utility of current devices is also limited by time and memory constraints. There is an unmet need to develop algorithms that can accurately predict the desired word from these user instructions, so that these efficient typing methods may be implemented in applications such as mobile computing and gaming settings.Innovation:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a software platform that enables rapid typing in English using only 6 or 9 key keyboards. This system relies on recurrent neural networks, which is a machine learning algorithm that uses inferences from previous datapoints and context to estimate subsequent words. After a character is inserted, this method assigns probability to each upcoming word and presents it to the user. This type of neural network is highly effective, as they have achieved near perfect accuracy in typing up to 120 words per minute using 9 key keyboards. The researchers achieve this using both a QWERTY keyboard configuration as well as an alphabetical one. The neural network and keyboard layout can be potentially modified for different languages, further amplifying the versatility of this technology.This new software platform can accelerate human communication for both commercial users as well as BCI patients. The implications of this technology extend far beyond conventional communication. In the realm of mobile computing, it offers a transformative solution for enhancing productivity and streamlining text input on smartphones and tablets. Likewise, in gaming applications, where rapid and precise input is crucial, this predictive technology opens new possibilities for immersive and responsive gameplay experiences.

As opposed to traditional CT imaging methods which use an energy integrating detector, PCCT uses detectors that count individual photons. The photon counting detectors can discriminate photons based on their energy levels, potentially enabling superior tissue characterization since different tissues absorb and scatter X-rays differently depending on the composition of the tissue. This system creates two major benefits; 1) significantly improved spatial resolutions of CT images, leading to better diagnostic decision making and 2) lower doses of radiation for patients. Despite these benefits, the full utility of PCCT has yet to be realized due to the still highly manual nature of image analysis. A vast number of multi-energy images are available from PCCT, but due to practical time constraints, radiologists and other interpreters only examine a subset of these images to reach diagnostic conclusions. There is a need for automated, accurate methods to screen through the full spectrum of PCCT-derived datasets to provide the greatest utility to patients.Innovation:Researchers led by Professor Matthew Brown have developed a software algorithm that applies deep neural networks to process medical images at high throughput and accuracy. The neural networks are trained on full spectrum PCCT data. The system employs a novel training and optimization process to optimize the algorithm for identification of the most accurate neural network and repeats this process until the best algorithm is identified.

Several pharmaceutical derivatives of THC have been approved by the FDA to treat chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea, and more conditions. While hexahydrocannabinols (HHCs), a specific class of THC derivatives, have been known for over 80 years, synthetic methods to produce them generate a mixture of isomers with a preference for the less active 9S isomer. These methods usually involve catalytic hydrogenation, a method with significant safety concerns. Different isomers often have different effects on the body, so the ability to synthesize the preferred 9R isomer is important.  With the growing market for HHCs, there is a clear need for a safer, more precise approach to HHCs.Innovation:Researchers led by Professor Neil Garg developed a novel method for the reduction of THC, leading to controllable stereochemistry for HHC production. This method can be applied to both \u22069- and \u22068-THC, providing a superior alternative to previous hydrogenation reactions with ratios of 9R:9S up to 10:1.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Bioengineering have developed an ultra-thin, self-powered, waterproof, biocompatible, and sensitive on-eyelid sensor network for wireless eye movement detection, enhancing vestibular diagnostics.Background:The human balance system relies on the interaction of the vestibular system with the visual and somatosensory systems. When disorders affect the vestibular organs in the inner ear, they can result in peripheral vertigo, characterized by feelings of spinning or dizziness. Roughly 40% of U.S. adults encounter vertigo, and approximately 80% of cases are peripheral. Detecting vestibular disorders early is essential to prevent falls and preserve one's overall well-being. Current diagnostic methods, like the bithermal vestibular caloric test and head-impulse test, have drawbacks: they lack objective measurements, depend on bulky recording equipment, and are limited in testing environments. To modernize vestibular assessments, there is a need for innovative wearable sensors for continuous monitoring and diagnosis. Additionally, the growing demand for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) equipment drives the need for improved on-eyelid tracking networks. These technologies rely on precise eye movement tracking for a seamless and immersive user experience, making advancements in this area increasingly crucial. Considering these challenges, there is an urgent need for the development and implementation of a novel on-eyelid sensor network.Innovation:Professor Jun Chen and his colleagues have developed a non-invasive sensor for vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) assessment. It is the first comprehensive and wearable eye tracking system providing high-fidelity and multi-indicator monitoring. The sensor is equipped with an ultrathin structure (~80 \u03bcm) and human skin-like mechanical softness (tens of kPa to ~1 MPa), featuring self-powered, waterproof, biocompatible and high-sensitive properties. This meticulously designed sensor array demonstrates a groundbreaking approach to diagnosing vestibular disorders by continuously tracking eye movements. It offers a quantitative analysis of spatiotemporal eye movement data, including velocity, frequency, and intensity. This innovation effectively addresses the limitations inherent in the existing VOR assessment system. Furthermore, the envisioned on-eyelid sensor network will pave the way for in-home VOR testing, data-driven diagnosis, telehealth monitoring, research into VR/AR devices, and various related domains reliant on the real-time capture of eye-generated signals.Potential Applications:\u2022    On-eyelid sensor/wearable eye tracking system forOphthalmic diagnostic equipmentTelemedicine and remote monitoringRehabilitation and physical therapySports performance technologyVR and AR and other consumer electronics developmentAdvantages:UltrathinBiocompatibleSelf-poweredWaterproofWirelessSensitiveDevelopment to Date:First successful demonstration of the invention: 2022/11/03.Reference:UCLA Case No. 2023-166Lead Inventor:Prof. Jun Chen; Mr. Jing Xu.",

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology have a novel discovery showing the potential benefit of engaging complement-mediated antibody functions in future KSHV vaccine development.\n\nBACKGROUND:Kaposi Sarcoma Associated Herpesvirus (KHSV) is the etiological agent for cancers such as Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion lymphoma. KHSV most frequently causes KS cancer. The American Cancer Society reports that KS develops from cells that line lymph or blood vessels and form colored blotches or tumors on the skin, called lesions, most commonly occurring in the legs, feet, or groin area. When these lesions start to form in the lungs, liver, or digestive tract, KS becomes life threatening. Although the occurrence of KS in the United States is low at about 4.5 cases per million people in 2017, the occurrence goes up 500 times for transplant patients and those with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). There is a need for a vaccine to alleviate the KS burden in the most affected populations.\n\nINNOVATION:UCLA researchers led by Dr. Ting-Ting Wu have used the basic structure of herpesviruses, the fact they contain genes that encode a major capsid protein, a small capsid protein and glycoprotein, to develop novel methods for herpesviruses.Virus-like vesicles (VLVs) are membrane-enclosed vesicles that resemble native enveloped viruses, but lack the viral capsid.Theyare secreted alongside live virions during the lytic infection of herpesviruses including KSHV. UCLA researchers have produced mutant VLVs that contained a deletion of a portion of the major capsid protein and DNA packaging. Further, researchers showed that mice immunized with adjuvanted VLVs generated KSHV-specific T cell and antibody responses. Additionally, neutralization of KSHV infection by the VLV immune serum is enhanced in the presence of a complement system. This novel finding shows that vaccination induces antibody effector functions and can potentially improve infection-induced humoral immunity.\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\nInhibition and treatment of diseases caused by herpesviruses, such as KHSV.Enhancing complement-mediated neutralization of herpesviruses, such as KHSV.\nADVANTAGES:\nUsed novel LNP-based adjuvants which are known to be potent adjuvants for protein-based vaccines.Observed a strong antibody response to ORF4, a complement regulatory protein.\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:This technology has an associated peer-reviewed publication and a pending patent. This work has been shown in a mouse model.\nRelated Papers (from the inventors only):Lan, A.K., et al.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers have developed a novel method to characterize lung tissue biomechanics and applied it to the creation of a computational model to improve understanding and visualization of lung diseases.Background:Chronic lower respiratory disease (ex. COPD) was the sixth leading cause of death in the United States in 2021, taking nearly 140,000 individuals. COPD is characterized by damaged lung tissue with altered biomechanical properties and ventilation profiles. Current staging methods using pulmonary function tests are insufficient to determine COPD phenotypes, contributing to nonoptimal treatment identification and implementation. Recent advancements in computed tomography (CT) imaging have led to improved characterization of lung heterogeneity and pulmonary lung function. In addition, lung biomechanics and airflow dynamics modeling have been investigated which can provide patient-specific models. However, such strategies have not been integrated into the patient selection and treatment process. Another key limitation of existing techniques is the inherent assumption of breathing cycle regularity; however, COPD patients cannot breathe regularly, severely impacting the actual efficacy of these techniques. Although biomechanical properties and airflow dynamics of COPD patients are direct indicators of the phenotype, little work has been done to non-invasively measure or model them in a subject-specific manner.Innovation:UCLA researchers in the Department of Radiation Oncology have developed a novel model for improving COPD phenotype characterization and response monitoring. This model accomplishes high accuracy and non-invasive lung biomechanical analysis through a novel patient-specific flow structure interaction (FSI) model. This model was generated using data acquired during free breathing, avoiding  regular breathing assumptions plaguing existing models. Instead of looking at how stiff lung tissue is in a straight-forward way like before, this new method focuses on how it can stretch and bounce back, which is crucial for understanding the special properties of diseased fibrotic tissue in COPD. . This improved characterization will enable researchers to develop personalized treatments that lead to better treatment response and improved quality of life.Potential Applications:\u2022    Personalized medicine.\u2022    COPD and other chronic respiratory illness diagnosis and treatment.\u2022    Pulmonary research.Advantages:\u2022    Non-invasive, hyperelastic modeling.\u2022    Fibrotic tissue biomechanical analysis without sorting artefacts.\u2022    More accurate COPD phenotype characterization.State of Development:The inventors have developed and experimentally tested a fluid mechanical model for pulmonary analysis.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers have developed a novel method to characterize lung tissue biomechanics and applied it to the creation of a computational model with which to guide lung elastography.Background:Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in people in the US. With an increasing focus on improving the patient\u2019s quality of life during therapy, there is a greater need to spare the normal lung regions and more precisely target the tumor. Approaches such as hypo-fractionated therapy, a method that drastically decreases treatment timelines by increasing individual doses, have been adopted to improve patient outcomes. These therapeutic approaches require an ability to precisely distinguish the regions inside the lung that function normally from those regions that are diseased. Elastography is a non-invasive way to image the local elastic properties of soft tissue to assess mechanical distress commonly associated with many lung diseases. Lung elastography is complicated by the fact that the air in the lungs renders conventional elastography techniques such as ultrasound difficult to perform. However, advances in endobronchial ultrasound elastography have resulted in diagnostic accuracies around 80% and significantly improved malignant vs benign tissue characterization. There remains a growing need to develop new computational models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of elastography measurements using these conventional imaging methods.Innovation:UCLA researchers in the Department of Radiation Oncology have developed a novel method to perform lung elastography using deformation information that would be available from four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) data acquired during radiotherapy. The advantage of this approach is that the model is formulated from well-established physical laws and requires no additional imaging or processing. Other comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can also be precisely characterized to further improve treatment plans. Unlike conventional elastography methods, this method directly correlates elasticity with the displacement of lung tissue in a clinically relevant manner. This new method has the potential to improve patient treatment plans by allowing radiologists to efficiently identify healthy vs diseased lung tissue for targeted radiotherapy.Potential Applications:\u2022    Higher-efficacy lung cancer treatment.\u2022    Personalized medicine.\u2022    Respiratory illness diagnosis and treatment.\u2022    Critical care settings\u2022    Hypo-fractionated therapyAdvantages:\u2022    Non-invasive modeling.\u2022    Increased tumor removal success.\u2022    More accurate elasticity characterization.State of Development:The inventors have developed a methodology for facile determination of lung tissue elasticity.

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UCLA\u2019s Department of Microbiology, Immunology, & Molecular Genetics (MIMG), and the department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology have identified a set of tissue-specific antigens which have been used to isolate and characterize a group of novel T-cell receptors (TCRs) which target prostate cancer specifically. Furthermore, this platform and approach are readily adaptable to other cancer types.BACKGROUND:Adoptive T-cell transfer-based cancer immunotherapy has exhibited the capacity to induce a potent response to solid tumors in patients across several different cancer types. Adoptive cell therapies make use of T-cell\u2019s natural cytotoxicity to target and kill cancer cells. One strategy to direct T-cells at cancer cells relies on the identification of T-cell receptors (TCRs) that specifically target peptide antigens displayed on major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on the surface of tumor cells. These TCRs are then engineered into T-cells to produce populations of therapeutic cells. It is therefore paramount that antigen targets that differentiate cancer-associated tissue from unrelated healthy cells are harnessed for the development of therapeutic TCRs. However, identification of effective antigen-TCR pairings is difficult, as productive targeting requires that the antigen be both sufficiently expressed and tissue specific to create a useful therapeutic window. TCRs directed at an antigen that is ubiquitously expressed by various tissues and organs suffer from \u201con-target off-tumor\u201d toxicity and damage to healthy tissue. As a result, identification of antigen-TCR pairings that restrict targeting to one tissue type with high specificity is incredibly valuable for a clinical response with minimal side-effects.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers have used multiple immunopeptidomic approaches to identify a set of tissue-specific restricted peptides in the prostate. These peptides were then used to identify T-cell receptors (TCRs) that show high specificity for epitopes in these peptides when introduced to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In various assays, these modified PBMCs selectively targeted cells expressing the target epitope without affecting control non-epitope presenting cells. This tissue-specific antigen is predominantly expressed in the prostate. This make this TCR a perfect candidate for treatment of advanced-stage prostate cancer, where many patients have already undergone prostatectomies, and thus reducing \u201con-tumor off-target\u201d toxicity. These epitopes and tissue-specific TCRs serve as a starting point forin-vivoexperiments and further potential clinical development. This technology could be used in conjunction with other T-cell engineering/ affinity maturation strategies to make the engineered TCR T-cell even more potent.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:Treatment of prostate cancer tumorsTissue specific localizationWorkflow can be used for other cancer typesAdvanced stage cancer therapyADVANTAGES:Tissue specificIncreased immune responseHighly selective for tumor cellsReduced \u201con-target off-tumor\u201d toxicityDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:Antigen-TCR pairing has been identified which has a robust but specific response in variousin-vitroassays and preliminaryin-vivo tests against antigens that are presented on prostate cancer.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the Division of Physical Sciences & Engineering have developed an efficient and cost-effective method for the improved simulation of open quantum systems.Open quantum systems are quantum systems that interact with their surroundings and possess dynamics that can be influenced by these interactions, leading to issues such as decoherence and dissipation. All areas of quantum mechanics face these issues of environmental interaction, as quantum systems generally exist in an open state. Existing methods of simulating open quantum systems require complex and computationally heavy approaches, which introduce noise and error to the system. Quantum simulation of non-unitary operators further introduces exponential costs. Current methods are also inefficient in simulating time series and large quantum systems, limiting their scalability and hardware-level integration. There remains an unmet need for an efficient technology for the simulation of open quantum systems.UCLA researchers, led by Professor Prineha Narang, have come up with a new way to simulate open quantum systems. They use a technique called low-depth convex unitary evolutions. This method simplifies the process by breaking down the representation of the quantum state in a straightforward manner. Their approach has several benefits. First, it doesn't rely on complex frameworks, which helps to reduce errors and makes the calculations simpler. Second, they've found a clever way to make the simulations more efficient by adding a random sampling technique directly into the hardware. This means they can run simulations faster and handle larger quantum systems without overwhelming the computer. One tricky thing about simulating quantum systems is that they can grow very quickly in complexity. However, the UCLA team has found a workaround. They limit the number of simulations they need to run by using a specific number of sample circuits. This helps to manage the computational challenges and keeps the simulations from becoming too overwhelming.-    Quantum computing algorithm design-    Quantum chemistry simulations-    Information processing-    Quantum machine learning-    Quantum network computing-    Reduced computational complexity-    Lower computational cost-    Lower simulation noise-    Real-time calibrationFirst demonstration of technology is complete as of March 2023.",

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the School of Medicine have developed a novel single-vector platform vaccine for preventing melioidosis, an infection caused byBurkholderia pseudomallei.BACKGROUND:Melioidosis, also known as Whitmore\u2019s disease, is an infectious disease that can infect both humans and animals. The bacteriumBurkholderia pseudomallei(Bp) is responsible for the disease and is found in contaminated soil and water, especially in tropical areas. Although this disease is predominant in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, the bacterium has been identified in Mississippi, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In total, the disease accounts for an estimated 165,000 cases and 89,000 deaths per year. Additionally, Bp is categorized as a potential bioweapon and Tier 1 Select Agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as inhalation of low doses of Bp can result in rapidly fatal pneumonia. This is a great health concern as melioidosis is not only difficult to diagnose, but it is difficult to treat due to its resistance to most conventional antibiotics. There is no licensed vaccine against melioidosis.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers led by Dr. Marcus Horwitz have developed a single vector platform vaccine for the prevention of melioidosis that is suitable for use in both humans and animals. The vaccine is built upon their previously developed LVS \u0394capBvector, a live attenuatedcapBmutant of the widely used tularemia vaccine known as Live Vaccine Strain (LVS), which has been administered to over 60 million people. Even before the major attenuatingcapBmutation, the parental LVS vaccine had two major attenuating deletions and several minor mutations of its bacterial parent. The melioidosis vaccine, which expresses several highly immunogenic Bp proteins, can be administered intradermally or by multiple other routes, e.g. subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intranasally, inhaled, or even orally to a mammalian host. Even a single dose has demonstrated high efficacy against lethal respiratory challenge in a rigorous and highly sensitive animal model. The developed vaccine is cost-effective, does not contain animal products, does not need an adjuvant, and has the ease of rapid large-scale manufacturing.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:Vaccine forBurkholderia pseudomalleifor both humans and animalsADVANTAGES:Simplified regulatory approvalCan be administered with other vaccines using the same vector including vaccines against the Tier 1 select agent diseases tularemia, anthrax and plagueNo need for animal products, adjuvantsMultiple routes of administrationLow toxicityDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:In vivovalidation in relevant highly sensitive mouse models show that the vaccines are safe and highly protective against lethal respiratory challenge.",

Leveraging the unique properties of quantum mechanics, quantum computers execute complex calculations exponentially faster than classical counterparts. Quantum random access memory holds a crucial role in quantum computing by enhancing data storage and retrieval processes, ultimately bolstering the efficiency and scalability of quantum computer systems. While various concepts of qRAM devices have been proposed, these systems operate at liquid helium temperatures, up to 9K, and none of them incorporate a molecular component, indicating an unexplored area.

Within the context of hydrogen production via electrolysis, platinum supported by carbon (Pt/C) catalysts plays a pivotal role. However, these catalysts exhibit limitations, including low durability, susceptibility to impurity poisoning, and relatively high costs. Notably, impurities like CO or H2S can readily impair activity and lifetime of Pt/C. With projections of a significant surge in global hydrogen demand, there arises a pressing need for the development of advanced catalysts.Innovation:UCLA researchers have developed a promising catalytic structure referred to as \"Ni(OH)2-shelled Pt-tetrapods.\" This new core-shell structure can significantly enhance reaction kinetics and allow selective transport of certain feedstock, while protecting the core catalysts from competitive adsorption and morphology degradation, leading to both optimized activity and durability. It allows the hydrogen transport rate to be tuned through the shell and thus tailor the local equilibrium pH at the surface of the core catalysts, leading to the desired proton concentration for pH-sensitive reactions. The technology offers improved reaction kinetics, the ability to effectively counteract catalyst poisoning, and an extended catalyst lifespan, even under challenging conditions.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Radiological Sciences have developed a novel method for coincidence counting to reduce the noise inherent in photon counting detectors.Background:The computed tomography (CT) scanning market is projected to grow from ~$6 billion to over $10 billion in 2030. Approximately 10% of this market size is the cost of the x-ray detector. Photon counting detectors (PCDs) are poised to play a critical role as components of next-generation CT technologies and are expected to eventually displace conventional energy-integrating detectors, starting from the premium segment. PCDs offer several advantages over energy-integrating detectors and they can provide multi-material and spectroscopic imaging while offering superior spatial resolution. In addition, PCDs improve contrast and are less susceptible to electronic noise. However, limitations to real PCD systems persist. Primarily, when employing secondary methods to increase the number of photons measured, single high-energy photons can be read as multiple events; this charge sharing limits the speed and resolution of next generation scanners. Several attempts have been made to mitigate charge sharing, but most existing proposals exacerbate pulse pileup, another detector non-ideality, and are hence not suited for PCDs today.Innovation:UCLA researchers have developed a method for charge sharing compensation called a coincidence counting bin (CCB) that can correct for charge sharing in the detector circuitry without compromise to resolution or pulse pileup and by using fast digital logic. This method stands to drastically decrease the noise experienced during x-ray CT scans. The proposed CCB improves spectral dose efficiency by 50-80%.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the David Geffen School of Medicine and Department of Neurosurgery have created a novel ventriculoperitoneal shunt failure detection system that can alert patients and healthcare providers to prevent life-threatening emergencies.Background:Each year, an estimated 30,000 ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts are surgically implanted in the United States to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients suffering from hydrocephalus and divert it to the abdomen. A significant proportion of these shunts face failure within the first two years, due to causes such as shunt obstruction, valve malfunction, or catheter fractures. These issues become apparent as early as the first year, with a substantial 30-40% of shunts experiencing failure, and a staggering 50% of these failing within two years of implantation. The commonality among all these failing cases is the interruption of CSF flow through the shunt.There is currently no FDA-approved, fully implantable VP shunt failure detection system capable of autonomously alerting patients and physicians to deteriorating shunt performance. While several devices have been developed for measuring CSF flow rate within VP shunts, their practical utility is hindered by various limitations, including over-the-skin operation, power-expensive operation which precludes battery-powered implantation, intermittent functionality, insufficient sensitivity for monitoring slow CSF flow, and disruption of CSF flow dynamics. Consequently, the need for an advanced warning system is increasingly evident, one that can alert both patients and medical care personnel to declining shunt function and impending VP shunt failure before the onset of symptoms, thus mitigating life-threatening emergency scenarios.Innovation:Professor Geoffrey Colby, David Zarrin, and their team have developed an innovative VP shunt failure detection system that can be seamlessly integrated into existing VP shunt systems during placement. This technology not only proactively alerts patients but also keeps medical care personnel informed about diminishing shunt function and the impending risk of VP shunt failure, significantly reducing the potential for life-threatening emergencies. At the core of this advancement is a highly sensitive flow sensor capable of measuring CSF flow with exceptional precision. It can detect flows as low as 0.01 mL/minute through a CSF shunt valve assembly and measure rates up to at least 0.3 mL/minute, covering the full range of physiologic CSF generation rate.The system consumes minimal power, making it an ideal candidate for use in an implantable and battery-powered VP shunt failure detection system. Additionally, the sensor's compact dimensions and flexibility allow for straightforward implantation with a new shunt system or to upgrade an existing shunt system, with minimal added bulk. This design also prioritizes patient comfort and compliance. Ultimately, this innovative technology not only promises to enhance awareness of shunt health but is also of paramount importance for the well-being of the thousands of patients in the United States whose health relies on the continued functionality of their ventricular shunting system.Potential Applications:VP shunt health/function detection systemIntracranial Pressure (ICP) MonitoringTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI) ManagementPressure sensing scenarios that require compatible and delicate designsAdvantages:Sensitive to low CSF flow velocitiesFunctional over the range of relevant CSF flow velocitiesLow power use for existing implantable systemRobust sensing mechanismCompact and flexibleCompatible with the existing VP shunt systemsDevelopment to Date:First successful demonstration of the invention completed.Reference:UCLA Case No. 2023-057Lead Inventor:Prof. Geoffrey P.

    "ip_description": "Summary:Researchers in UCLA's Department of Materials Science and Engineering have developed a solution-based synthesis platform capable of generating micro and nanostructured gels, polymers, and composites with simultaneously improved safety, mechanical and ionic conductivity/transport properties.Background:Pore structure engineering holds immense promise across various applications, such as energy storage, tissue engineering and drug delivery, positioning it as a versatile material platform in emerging fields like soft robotics and electronic devices. The surging demand for energy storage, particularly in systems exposed to harsh environments, emphasizes the critical necessity for electrolytes that seamlessly integrate mechanical robustness, thermal stability, and efficient mass transport. However, despite their potential, conventional porous materials experience a key technological hurdle: they often excel in either diffusion/transport or mechanical performance, presenting a fundamental trade-off between the two desired properties. Striking a balance has proven difficult for conventional porous structures, and existing approaches face limitations such as complexities in synthesis, encompassing expensive raw materials and non-tunable structures. Within the context of battery separators/electrolytes, the common strategy of implementing liquid electrolytes compromises mechanical integrity, leaving devices vulnerable to freeze-induced damage and mechanical impacts. Remarkably, previously reported anti-freezing strategies involving salts or additives have proven detrimental to mechanical properties. Therefore, the urgent need arises for a novel synthesis approach capable of creating a hydrogel electrolyte that is mechanically robust, thermally stable, and mass transport-friendly simultaneously, addressing the limitations and paving the way for transformative advancements in various industries.Innovation:Professor Ximin He and her team have developed a solution-based synthesis platform for producing porous gels, polymers, and composites featuring a distinctive open-cell porous structure, providing exceptional and customizable mechanical properties, ionic conductivity, and thermal stability. The method, driven by generic interactions, exhibits versatility across diverse polymer frameworks, offering a facile, cost-effective, and scalable solution-based synthesis operating at room temperature. The innovation extends to the creation of highly-ionically-conductive porous structures, exemplified by an electrolyte showcasing unparalleled ion transport speed. In battery prototypes, this translated to an impressive one order of magnitude lower overpotential under the same current. Impressively, the as-prepared product also boasts tunable mechanical properties, with the highest toughness surpassing the state-of-the-art gels by a factor of 1000 and exceeding Kevlar\u00ae by 10X. The method's versatility is further demonstrated in an anti-freezing zinc-ion battery electrolyte. This electrolyte is featured with ultrahigh strength (tensile strength 15.6 MPa), freeze-tolerance (maintaining mechanical flexibility at -77 \u00b0C for 24 hours), dendrite and parasitic reactions suppression, ensuring stable performance over 30,000 cycles with negligible capacity decrease. In their culmination, these landmark properties spanning mechanical resilience, electrical performance, and thermal stability indicate clearly a new platform that is non-flammable, less prone to catastrophic thermal or mechanical failures, faster to manufacture, more flexible, longer lasting, and overall higher performing than conventional technologies present in the industry, especially those producing and relying on batteries.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Physics and Astronomy Department have developed a quantum information processing method that encodes multiple qubits within single atoms in trapped atom quantum processors, enabling efficient qubit manipulation for enhanced computational capacity.Background:Quantum computing is an emerging technology with immense market significance. The global quantum computing market is projected to reach $4.375 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of over 38%. Quantum computers leverage quantum mechanics' unique properties to perform complex calculations much faster than classical computers. This has implications for cryptography, optimization, and AI, promising breakthroughs in fields such as simulating quantum systems, developing advanced materials, and optimizing supply chains. Quantum computing's potential to revolutionize industries and solve problems that are currently intractable positions it as a transformative force in the technological landscape. Researchers are exploring methods to enhance the capabilities of quantum computing systems. The exploration covers the two extremes of the spectrum: encoding all qubits within a single atom (unary encoding) and encoding one qubit per atom (monoqubit encoding). Unary encoding becomes resource-intensive as the problem size increases, while monoqubit encoding faces limitations due to the unreliable utilization of atoms. Hence, there is a potential advantage in encoding a modest number of qubits per atom, making it imperative to develop a practical technique to achieve this polyqubit encoding.Innovation:Professor Wesley Campbell and Professor Eric Hudson have developed a method called polyqubit processing within trapped atom quantum processors. This innovation successfully demonstrates a way to encode multiple qubits within a single atom and introduces techniques to perform operations and computations on these qubits without disturbing other qubits stored in the same atom. This achievement enables a higher level of information storage and manipulation within quantum systems. By utilizing the existing internal states of atomic processors, this polyqubit processing approach enables a more efficient utilization of resources and offers practical advantages due to the compatibility with standard binary quantum algorithms and qubit quantum error correction (QEC).

However, traditional FLIM methods suffer from long acquisition time, especially in 3D imaging as slices must be taken at many points along the depth axis. Other technologies such as Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) utilize conventional gated cameras in both temporal resolution and sensitivity, but significant amounts of information in each pixel is lost to complicated processing requirements of SPAD arrays. Linear SPAD arrays allow for much more useful information in each pixel, increasing image quality, but 3D imaging using linear SPAD arrays greatly increases acquisition time.

However, fluorescence emission from samples is both spatially and temporally incoherent, and fluorescence microscopy generally lacks digital image propagation and time-reversal framework that is commonly employed in coherent microscopy for 3D imaging. Therefore, 3D fluorescence imaging used in confocal or various super-resolution microscopy techniques is generally acquired through scanning across the samples volume, where several 2D fluorescence images are acquired, one for each focal plane or point in 3D. Because of the requirement for mechanical scanning in 3D fluorescence imaging, the image acquisition speed and the throughput of the system are greatly limited for volumetric samples, even with optimized scanning strategies. Additionally, because the images at different sample planes/points are not acquired simultaneously, the temporal variations of the sample fluorescence can inevitably cause image artifacts. Moreover, photo-toxicity and photobleaching are also concerning because the sample needs to be repeatedly excited during the scanning process. Thus, non-scanning 3D fluorescence microscopy methods are needed to overcome these challenges.Innovation:Researchers at UCLA have developed a deep learning-based neural network termed Deep-Z that inherently learns the physical laws governing fluorescence wave propagation and time-reversal, and computationally retrieves 3D image of fluorescent sample from a single 2D wide-field fluorescence image, without sacrificing the imaging speed, spatial resolution, filed-of-view, or throughput of a standard fluorescence microscope. This data-driven fluorescence image propagation framework does not need a physical model of the imaging system, and rapidly propagates a 2D fluorescence image onto user-defined 3D surfaces without iterative searches or parameter estimates.

However, for higher-stake tasks like tumor detection and rare disease diagnosis, AI is not yet ready to replace human pathologists as any erroneous diagnosis is potentially a matter of life and death. Pathologists today still must manually examine histopathological images, which is a laborious process because each patient\u2019s case often consists of multiple ultra-high-resolution images. Ultimately, a successful AI pathology tool needs to bolster a practicing physician\u2019s repertoire, rather than attempt to replace it.Innovation:UCLA researchers have developed a smart histopathological image viewer called NaviPath. NaviPath, guided by artificial intelligence, recommends regions of interest likely to contain tumor cells on a digital histology slide for a pathologist to further investigate. As a pathologist proceeds through his or her standard histology examination workflow, the viewer displays regions of interest overlaid onto the image, as well as the criteria that were used to identify the regions; criteria that are weighted by the examining pathologist. The pathologist can then examine the proposed region in depth as the NaviPath viewer displays the factors that went into its decision matrix. The displayed decision-making removes blind trust from the physician\u2019s point of view. Even with the AI\u2019s guidance, the final medical decision is made by the pathologist, ensuring software accountability. This tool leverages AI\u2019s medical diagnostic capabilities to inform medical professionals, saving both time and effort in a clinical setting.Potential Applications:\u25cf    Tumor detection and grading\u25cf    Rare disease identification\u25cf    Drug response predictions\u25cf    Education and medical learning toolAdvantages:\u25cf    Reports multiple AI-computed pathology criteria.\u25cf    Presents traceable evidence for each report.\u25cf    Allows pathologists to perform diagnoses in routine practice workflows.\u25cf    Establishes symbiotic relationship between AI and clinicianState of Development:The inventors have developed a software, NaviPath, which has been technically evaluated and tested by 12 clinical pathologists.Related Papers:1.

    "ip_description": "UCLA Researchers in the Department of Neurology/Neuro-Oncology and the David Geffen School of Medicine have developed methods for the Cas9-CRISPR mediated epigenetic targeting of malignant glioma, and which results in enhanced chemosensitivity to standard chemotherapeutic agents.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nMalignant gliomas are aggressive brain tumors originating from the glial cells that support and protect neurons in the central nervous system. They are the most common primary brain tumor with approximately 20,000 new cases diagnosed each year resulting in nearly 10,000 deaths. Gliomas are one of the deadliest categories of cancer, and nearly 50% of gliomas are diagnosed with the most aggressive form, glioblastoma (GBM) which has an average five-year survival rate of less than 10%. Current treatment approaches for malignant gliomas typically involve a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy; however, despite an emphasis on precision and targeted therapies, to date, the development and approval of new therapeutic modalities for gliomas and GBM has been limited. Additional approaches, which work as standalone or in combination with current standards, are still needed; specifically, there\u2019s an absence of methods that exploit the epigenetic states of gliomas for therapeutic advantage.\n\nINNOVATION:\nUCLA Researchers in the Department of Neurology and Neuro-Oncology have developed novel protocols for the use of CRISPR-based editing tools to modulate the expression of key molecular factors involved in brain tumor pathophysiology. This approach utilizes deactivated Cas9 ( dCas9 ) based fusion proteins in conjunction with short guide RNA constructs to target specific curated regions in the genome for methylation. Epigenetic modification with these constructs of targeted genomic regions resulted in enhanced sensitivity of tumor cells to alkylating chemotherapy agents in vitro. This versatile technique can be adapted to selectively silence or activate target gene transcription, meaning it can be tailored to optimize therapeutic efficacy for  specific disease context and brain tumor subtype.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\nCombination therapy for gliomas / GBM\nGeneral method for targeting methylation in specific regions of the genome\nTherapy for other cancers that benefit from methylation-based silencing/activation\n\nADVANTAGES:\nCan be tailored to increase/decrease transcript gene expression\nIncreases the response to DNA alkylating agents\nDoes not need to edit the genome.

Given the prevalence of GI tract diseases globally, addressing the challenges they present is paramount. In 2018 alone, there were 37.2 million visits to physician's offices in the USA for digestive system disorders. The significance of localization system cannot be overstated in advancing the treatment of not only GI tract diseases but also a spectrum of biomedical applications.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers at the Departments of Medicine and Microbiology Immunology and Molecular Genetics have developed a novel bispecific antibody-based immunotherapy strategy for the treatment of Cytomegalovirus infections.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nThe human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a widespread virus estimated to infect 60% of American adults and nearly 100% of the population in some parts of the world. Most infections in healthy individuals are lifelong and immunologically contained and therefore asymptomatic. However, immunocompromised individuals and those perinatally infected can develop severe infections that can result in high morbidity and mortality rates due to organ damage. FDA-approved drugs are available to treat CMV infections but come with major limitations. For instance, foscarnet and cidofovir pose a high risk of nephrotoxicity. For all currently used drugs, there is also growing concern of viral resistance mutations developing in CMV strains reducing their therapeutic efficacy. A new class of immunotherapies are being developed for the use against CMV. Immune cells responsible for controlling CMV infection are CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs). Anti-CMV antibodies and autologous immunotherapy using CMV-specific CTLs have limited efficacy or labor intensive and technically challenging to mass produce. Thus, there is a strong need for safe and effective therapeutics against CMV.\n\nINNOVATION:\n\nResearchers at UCLA have developed a novel therapeutic strategy to treat CMV infections utilizing a T cell redirecting bispecific antibody (TRBA). This entails an antibody-based molecule with binding domains against cell surface viral antigen and a CD3 antigen found on CTLs. The bispecific antibody will crosslink CTLs to target cells to induce killing of CMV-infected cells. Researchers identified a viral surface protein expressed abundantly in CMV-infected cells in the early stage of the viral life cycle. The variable chains of the antiviral antigen and anti-CD3 antibodies were used to form the TRBA, bispecific against a CMV-infected cell and immune cells responsible for curtailing CMV infections.In vitrostudies confirm the TRBA\u2019s ability to recruit CD8 T cells and antiviral activity against CMV-infected cells with majority clearance as early as 6 hours.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\nImmunotherapy against human cytomegalovirus infection\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\nLonger in vivo half lives compared to single chain antibodies (so-called \u201cBiTEs\u201d or bi-specific T cell engagers)\nIncreased affinity due to the use of two binding sites against each specificity per molecule (as compared to BiTEs that have one binding site each)\nAntibody-based therapeutic that accomplishes the same effect as chimeric antigen-receptor T cell gene therapy\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:\nValidation of concept shown in human cells infected with CMV\n\nRelated Papers (from the inventors only)\n\nChiuppesi et al, J Virol. 2015 Dec;89(23):11884-98 (PMID 26378171)",

Terpenoids have found a wide array of commercial applications, ranging from cosmetics, foods, personal care products and even pharmaceutical compounds. The enzymes within these bioengineered microorganisms not only exhibit great biodegradability, but they can also catalyze specific reactions with high precision. For example, the total synthesis of terpenoids from commercially available materials can be challenging due to their complex functionality and multiple stereocenters, but these issues can be addressed through genetic engineering of enzymes. However, current genetic manipulations can be unpredictable. There is a need to include multifunctionality within genetically engineered enzymes to enhance their catalytic efficiency and reduce chemical production costs.Innovation:UCLA researchers have developed a method to genetically engineer Y. lipolytica to increase sustainable production of valuable terpenoids. A novel terpenoid named farnesyl diacid can be produced within this microorganism directly from cellulose.

The ear-related effects of Usher\u2019s disease are caused by an abnormal development of sound receptor cells in the inner ear. In contrast, progressive degeneration of RT initially causes night-blindness and a loss of peripheral vision until only central vision remains and results in a condition known as tunnel vision. The National Eye Institute reports that Usher syndrome is an inherited genetic disease attributed to 9 different genes and affects approximately 4 to 17 per 100,000 people in the United States. There is currently no cure for Usher syndrome.\n\nINNOVATION:UCLA researchers led by Dr. David Williams have discovered a novel approach utilizing gene augmentation for the treatment of Usher syndrome. They have discovered that one of the most common USH1 genes,MYO7A, has two isoforms with varying expression.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Medicine have developed a novel geometric model for the determination of the time constant in variable oxygen uptake kinetic systems.Background:The kinetic response of oxygen uptake adjustment to moderate-intensity exercise is a main factor of the aerobic function. Aerobic function is an indicator of physical fitness, differing in healthy individuals, and those with various cardiovascular diseases. Typical kinetic response to a change in power can be modeled as an exponential function with a time constant (\u03c4VO2). Although critical to oxygen uptake modeling, \u03c4VO2 is difficult to measure due to the variability of breath-by-breath uptake values and breath interval variability. Overcoming the oxygen uptake variability is a matter of physical repetition and the superimposition of the measured breath-by-breath data; typically six exercise repetitions are implemented for power output tests. Current testing protocols are time consuming and burdensome to subjects in clinical studies, and thus there is a need for a novel method to efficiently determine the time constant.Innovation:UCLA researchers have developed a novel mathematical method for the determination of \u03c4VO2, a vital component of aerobic fitness useful in assessing the efficiency of a person\u2019s oxygen use. This model requires only a single exercise protocol while maintaining an accuracy equivalent to or better than the current gold-standard methods reliant on multi-point studies.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering have designed a modular robotic system termed the Latching Intelligent Modular Mobility System (LIMMS) for the manipulation of a typical last-mile delivery.TITLE: Latching Intelligent Modular Mobility System (LIMMS) for Logistics and Last-Mile DeliveryBackground:The rapid growth of e-commerce has placed tremendous pressure on companies to efficiently deliver packages directly to customers' homes, transforming the delivery landscape and making last-mile logistics a critical focus for businesses. While last-mile delivery is crucial to the overall customer experience, the process is complicated by the range in urban terrains and package size and weight. Traditional methods of last-mile delivery rely heavily on manual labor, which is costly and time-consuming. Recent advances in wheeled and legged robotic delivery systems have addressed some of these issues. The design complexities posed by dynamic environments and varying package sizes, however, have hindered the effectiveness of existing robotic platforms. Additionally, these technologies tend to occupy a large amount space and have a high cost of transport, limiting their use in general purpose deliveries. There remains a need for an affordable and automated robotic system that can efficiently deliver a large number of packages and traverse a range of unpredictable environments for last-mile deliveries.Innovation:UCLA researchers in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering have developed a modular robotic system, the Latching Intelligent Modular Mobility System (LIMMS), specifically tailored to address the challenges of last-mile delivery.  The design removes the need for a centralized body by using the package being transported or the inside walls of the delivery vehicle for that purpose.  Limb-like robots equipped with latching mechanisms are attached to the vehicle wall or payload.  This modular approach offers significant energy and space savings in delivery tasks. The latching mechanisms allow for a significant tolerance to misalignment that is twice as high as traditional methods (2X). Furthermore, LIMMS exhibits remarkable versatility, enabling it to perform a wide range of tasks by skillfully interacting with the surroundings and adeptly manipulating objects. In a typical delivery scenario, LIMMS units attach themselves to anchor points within delivery trucks, providing assistance in the movement of boxes. Once the package is positioned for removal from the vehicle, the LIMMS units attach to the box, transforming into a quadruped structure that facilitates autonomous delivery. LIMMS units are engineered to operate effectively within dynamic environments and have the capacity to handle diverse package sizes and loads, ensuring optimal performance and adaptability. Furthermore, the design principles underlying LIMMS have the potential for broader applications beyond last-mile delivery. For instance, the device can be adapted to develop innovative robotic systems aimed at safely transporting wounded soldiers from the battlefield to secure zones. The first hardware prototype of this system has been successfully designed and demonstrated.Potential Applications:\u2022    Robots for automated last-mile delivery\u2022    Robots to move equipment/materials inside humanless warehouse/factory\u2022    Autonomous robots that can carry wounded soldiers to safety\u2022    Other mechanical systems that require similar latching mechanismsAdvantages:\u2022    Great mobility and manipulation capability\u2022    Robust and compact design\u2022    Saves energy and space\u2022    Adapts to different environment based on need\u2022    Tolerates a high degree of misalignment\u2022    Highly customizableDevelopment to Date:First successful demonstration of the invention: September 2021Related Papers:Zhu, Taoyuanmin, Gabriel I.

Concurrently, significant progress has been made in creating computer vision models for this domain. However, reluctance to deploy these models on actual patient data stems from their \"black box\" nature, prioritizing accuracy over interpretability. Traditional slide viewers facilitate annotation and abnormal region detection but do not integrate advanced computer vision models. There is a need to harness computer vision advances in a manner that gains pathologists' trust. This requires integrating models into a slide viewer with findings that can be interacted with, enabling scalable diagnoses and annotations, reducing slide analysis costs and time, and generating more training data to improve existing models.Dr. Chen and his research team have developed an interactive and hierarchical reporting tool for histopathological image analysis, which combines AI diagnostics optimized for explainability with the pathologist's expertise in detecting abnormal tissue samples.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed an accelerometer model that uses optomechanical transduction, enabling higher precision motion detection through a simplified design.Modern transportation and communication technologies rely on the measurement and transduction of minute forces for position determination. Traditional technologies use capacitive or piezoresistive techniques that incorporate micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) via integrated circuit technologies to convert accelerometer motion into an electric readout. The required circuit components are often complex, bulky, and costly, and suffer from increased noise and reduced sensitivity. Laser-based optomechanical transduction has emerged as a method of increasing device sensitivity.  However, the practical implementation of optomechanical systems remains a challenge due to their complicated fabrication and limited dynamic range. There remains an unmet need for an affordable optomechanical device for inertial sensing.UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a novel optomechanical accelerometer system with an integrated optical feedback system. This accelerometer is comprised of an optical oscillator acting on a mechanical oscillator. The radiation pressure of an integrated laser drives the mechanical system into oscillation, allowing for significant improvements in measurement sensitivity and dynamic range. Minute changes in mechanical resonance are used to measure specific force. The photonic crystal integrated onto the silicon-on-insulator has been optimized for maximum radiation pressure generation by reducing electric field leakage.

    "ip_number": "2022-322",
    "published_date": "2022",
    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:Researchers at UCLA\u2019s School of Dentistry have developed methods and protocols for culturing and priming various immune cells into a \u201csupercharged\u201d phenotype. The studied cell types include NK and iNKT cells, gamma delta T cells, and CD8+ T cells. When deployed in combination, these supercharged cells were found to eliminate both poorly and well-differentiated oral and pancreatic tumours and cancer stem cells, and thus are well suited for dealing with heterogenous tumor types.BACKGROUND:Biomedical research over the last two decades has highlighted the role of the immune system in stopping or slowing tumorigenesis while showcasing the importance of the immunological state of the tumor. This has made it possible to target tumors with immunotherapeutic approaches such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. More recent discoveries have made it clear that different immune cell populations such as natural killer cells (NK), or specific subsets of T-cell populations such as gamma delta T cells and supercharged CD8+ T cells can also be isolated from patients and redeployed as directed therapeutic intervention against various cancers. However, such approaches have suffered from a similar theme in their limitations to fully eliminate the tumor: the eventual development of resistance or inability to turn the tumors responsive. These obstacles are in part a result of the heterogeneous nature of cancer as well as the varying capacities of the different types of immune cells to preferentially target some cell types over others. These issues are further confounded by the isolation and culturing process which may reduce therapeutic capacity of the immune cells. For further maturation of immunotherapeutic approaches, new culturing and expansions strategies are needed alongside improved methods for managing the heterogeneous nature of tumors.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers from the laboratory of Dr. Anahid Jewett have previously discovered and established protocols for using osteoclasts to effectively expand and/or activate gamma delta T (gdT) cells, various types of T cells (e.g., CD8+ T cells, CD3 T cells), and/or invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells. These coculturing protocols result in a \u201csupercharged\u201d phenotype where the expanded cells elicit an improved and robust response against the tumor. These supercharged immune cells were also found to preferentially target different aspects of the tumor. For example, supercharged NK cells are more adept at eliminating cancer stem cells, while other types preferentially target highly differentiated tumors. Finally, these supercharged phenotypes have been shown to target and reduce tumor size in pancreatic and oral cancer models. In instances where different supercharged types are combined, a greater response and reduction of the tumor burden has been observed.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022    Treatment of both oral and pancreatic tumours\u2022    Targeting cancer-stem cells\u2022    Treatment of immunologically cold tumoursADVANTAGES:\u2022    Combination treatment addresses the pitfalls of single cell-type immune therapies\u2022    Suited for treatment of heterogenous tumours\u2022    Supercharged cells better target autologous tumoursDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:Protocols for priming and culturing of supercharged immune cells have been established.

Despite continued progress in limiting mortality with new treatments, including monoclonal antibodies and immunotherapy, the high death rate from cancer is primarily contributed by metastasis and relapse. Increasing evidence points to the key role that cells in the tumor stroma play in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. The chemokine CXCR4 has been implicated as a key factor that mediates communication between cancer cells and immune cells in their microenvironment. In fact, CXCR4 is overexpressed in more than 23 human cancers, playing a key role in excluding immune cells from the cancer core and impacting metastatic spread of cancer cells. Thus, developing treatments to disrupt the function of CXCR4 by inhibitory drugs could transform cancer treatment for a wide variety of tumors.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers led by Dr. Andre Nel in the School of Medicine have developed lipid bilayer coated nanocarriers for delivery of a CXCR4 antagonist to treat tumors. Using in vivo murine models of pancreatic and breast cancer, they found that the CXCR4 antagonist successfully disrupted tumor-stromal interactions, with reduction of tumor growth and metastasis.  The impact of growth reduction included the ability of the antagonists to increase immune cell access to the tumor core and reducing the impact of immune suppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment.  Targeted delivery of the CXCR4 antagonist to the tumor microenvironment helped to diminish off-target systemic inflammatory effects. Taken together, a new method to deliver therapeutic agents to tumor microenvironments could reduce mortality of cancers.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022    Targeted delivery of CXCR4 antagonists to treat pancreatic cancer and triple negative breast cancer, in adjunct to chemo or chemo-immunotherapyADVANTAGES:\u2022    The lipid bilayer coated nanocarrier platform allows versatility of also including synergistic therapeutic agents in the lipid bilayer, in addition to CXCR4 antagonist in the carrier interior\u2022    Improved pharmacokinetics of drug delivery\u2022    Reduced off-target effects\u2022    Carrier can be intravenously injected for targeted deliveryDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:This technology was successfully demonstrated to reduce tumor growth in multiple types of tumor murine models, including pancreatic cancer and triple negative breast cancer.Related Papers (from the inventors only):Nel AE*, Mei KC, Liao YP, Liu X.

This has resulted in over 6.9 million deaths worldwide.  There have been numerous efforts to prevent and treat COVID-19 infections, such as vaccines and antiviral medications. The Center for Disease Control reported that in January 2023 alone, adults who received the COVID-19 vaccine treatment with the associated bivalent booster had a 10.9X lower risk of having a COVID-19 associated hospitalization. At-home oral treatments such as the antiviral Nirmatrelvir with Ritonavir (Paxlovid) have proven to reduce the risk of hospitalization for some patients, but researchers have found that a COVID-19 rebound is more common in patients treated with Paxlovid. Despite a worldwide need, there is no safe, efficacious oral antiviral that can be given long term for patients with prolonged virus shedding such as immunocompromised patients or even for post-acute COVID-19 condition. An accessible, safe and highly effective oral treatment for COVID-19 is needed.INNOVATION:Researchers at UCLA led by Dr. Theodoros Kelesidis have uncovered a novel COVID-19 therapy to inhibit viral replication, cytotoxic injury, aberrant host inflammatory responses and progression of lung injury.

Anti-tumor antibodies (ATAbs) induce abundant active humoral immune response against many tumor types. However, due to mechanisms of cancer immune evasion, ATAbs only weakly induce tumor cell deathin vitroand are ineffective at eliminating tumorsin vivo. Recently, studies of monoclonal Ab therapies for infectious disease have revealed that regulation of Ab responses occurs not only through antigen binding but also a network of immune receptor interactions via Fc domains of antibodies. The properties of Fc domains, including type, isotype, and glycan changes, play a significant role in determining the nature and magnitude of ATAb immune responses. In infectious disease studies, system serological techniques to profile Ab Fc properties have been applied. These approaches involve enrichment of antibodies with antigen-conjugated beads and detection of Fc properties with florescent reagents. These measurements quantitatively reflect regulatory changes in Fc composition, predict functional immune cell responses, and identify mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection. However, this standard system serology approach is precluded in cancer studies by the complexity and uniqueness of antigen targets in tumor cells. Given that it is critical to determine Fc properties for enhanced understanding of cancer humoral immunity, a standard systematic serological method to determine these properties of ATAbs could revolutionize cancer therapy.\n\nINNOVATION:\n\nUCLA researchers led by Dr. Aaron Meyer in the Department of Bioengineering have developed a novel systems serology platform for profiling the Fc properties of ATAbs. The researchers have implemented an optimized protocol to selectively isolate ATAbs. They have demonstrated successful quantitative profiling of Fc properties using known mixtures of monoclonal Abs. This assay shows high sensitivity and reproducibility in various metrics, including the ability to predict immune effector cell-elicited responses in a panel of high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas. Using the assay, researchers demonstrated that the Fc properties of ATAbs have distinct properties from those against viruses in the same patients, and the differences consistently correlated with poor induction of effector responses. Characterizing ATAb Fc properties as an important regulatory checkpoint indicates new therapeutic approaches for overcoming anti-tumor immune dysregulation.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\nReveal the regulatory mechanism by which ATAbs are ineffective at tumor elimination\nCharacterize the specific antibody-immune receptor interactions that predict treatment response and other clinical features\nAllow for high-resolution monitoring of tumor immune responses\nEnable the development of a personalized autologous therapy\nServe as an effective prognostic signal for predicting and monitoring therapeutic responses\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\nThe assay has been shown to be effectively quantitative, comprehensive, and multiplexed in profiling the immune receptor interactions of ATAbs\nThe platform is easily adopted clinically as antibodies are systemic and easily accessible through a blood dra\nThis approach could potentially be applied in other diseases where the antigen targets are unknown or complex but the cellular targets are known, such as in autoimmune diseases",

    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:Researchers at UCLA\u2019s School of Medicine have developed a potent multi-antigen vaccine for protection against tuberculosis.BACKGROUND:Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that, when active, can affect many organs in the body but can especially cause severe lung disease manifest by chronic cough, fever, and weight loss, and, if left untreated, death. Globally, an estimated 10 million active TB cases are reported each year, resulting in ~1.5 million deaths. The only licensed vaccine against TB (BCG) was developed 100+ years ago; while reasonably effective in protection of infants and young children, BCG vaccine has poor efficacy in adolescents and adults. Thus, of great interest are novel vaccines and booster vaccines that confer potent protection against TB and reduce global mortality. Alternative approaches to the Listeria vectored vaccine described herein, including protein/adjuvant vaccines and viral-vectored vaccines, have delivered poor or only modest results in human studies. In order to end TB as a global health problem, there is an urgent need for an effective and safe vaccine for use in adults and adolescents.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers led by Dr. Marcus Horwitz in the School of Medicine have developed novel TB vaccine candidates to operate as stand-alone vaccines for adults or as boosters to BCG-vaccinated persons. The researchers designed their vaccines employing a safe and powerful attenuated Listeria monocytogenes vector to express five or nine highly immunoprotective antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes TB. They tested the 5-antigen vaccine as a booster vaccine for BCG in two mouse models and demonstrated that the vaccine enhances the level of protection conferred by BCG against aerosol challenge with the highly virulent Erdman strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mbt). They subsequently tested the 5-antigen and 9-antigen multi-antigenic vaccines as standalone vaccines in two mouse models and an outbred guinea pig model. The UCLA researchers found that these vaccines, when administered subcutaneously, induce strong antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses and protect against aerosol challenge with the Mtb Erdman strain. Both of these vaccine candidates were safe in all these animal models and also in non-human primates. These promising new vaccines hold great promise as a tool for eradicating TB.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022    Vaccination against TB in people previously vaccinated with BCG\u2022    Vaccination against TB in people not previously vaccinated with BCGADVANTAGES:\u2022    Broader and increased protection against TB\u2022    Increases protection in BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects\u2022    Low toxicity.

    "published_date": "2020",
    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:UCLA researchers in the Department of Psychiatry have discovered a novel approach that decreases the additive response of patients to opiates, but maintains their potent pain relief property.BACKGROUND:Prescription opioids are commonly prescribed by medical doctors to treat symptoms of severe pain. Opioids function by binding and activating receptors throughout the central nervous system and other organs. Once the opioid binds to the receptors, they block pain signals from being sent to the brain and can release dopamine in the body. Although patients receive pain relief, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention have issued a caution about their use in the medical field due to their addictive qualities, and the damage caused by these drugs in the ongoing opioid epidemic. The CDC estimates that 841,000 people have died from a drug overdose since 1999 in the United States, of those drug overdose deaths, over 70% of them were caused by opioids. Current efforts to combat the opioid epidemic with consideration for the medical value of opioids in the clinic are limited to educating healthcare providers with tools and guidance to enhance decision making when potentially prescribing opioids to patients. The guidance and resources offered to doctors is often ambiguous and unclear, leading to unfortunate consequences for patients in need of severe pain management. The addictive characteristics of opioids must be overcome to fully leverage their pain-relieving potential in a safe and effective manner.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers led by  Dr. Jerome Siegel have shown that it is possible to provide patients with the potent pain relief provided by opiates, while reducing the risk of addiction through co-administration of another FDA approved molecule. Leveraging previous research from the same group that showed that human heroin addicted brains have cell morphology changes in their neurons that can remain for up to a three years after opioid drug treatment, the researchers have now made significant progress in identifying addiction-associated changes in neurons and how they can be prevented. The researchers identified that co-administration of this molecule, which is FDA approved and widely used in the clinic, with opioids completely prevents these physiological changes in neurons, without affecting the analgesic properties of opioid administration. This technology can serve to revolutionize how prescription opioids are administered to prevent addictive consequences.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022    Management of severe pain for individuals at risk of addiction\u2022    Combating opioid epidemic by reducing total volume of opioid drugs produced.ADVANTAGES:\u2022    Reduced risk of addiction.\u2022    Maintains analgesic properties of opioids.DEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:Researchers have data that shows that the addiction-associated changes in specific neurons produced by morphine treatment of mice, is completely prevented through co-administration of an FDA approved drug.Related Papers (from the inventors only):McGregor, R., Ming-Fung, W., Holmes, B., Lam, H.A., Maidment, N.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have created a fleet of robots capable of performing autonomous 3D printing with exceptional speed, resolution, and precision.Background:The 3D printing robot industry has witnessed exciting developments in recent years, with advancements in precision, speed, and versatility. As demand for customized and intricate structures increases across industries like aerospace, automotive, and construction, the evolution in 3D printing technology is expected to drive a growth surge in the market. However, despite these improvements, several challenges still need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of 3D printing robots. One obstacle is the limited printing area, which hinders the printing of large structures. Additionally, current 3D printing techniques only allow for simple-shaped structures, requiring custom robots for different shapes. Another challenge arises when 3D printing in space or other harsh environments, where unanticipated amount of vibration from all possible degrees of freedom can cause significant inaccuracies in the printed structure.  Considering these challenges, there is an urgent need for innovative solutions to enhance 3D printing performance and enable better structures under demanding conditions.Innovation:Professor Jonathan Hopkins and his research team have developed a 3D printing robot that is capable of crawling on the structures it prints. The robot's feet use granular jamming pads to adhere to any shape that is printed, allowing it to move along and stabilize itself during the printing process. Multiple robots, each with a specialized ink deposit, could be deployed to collectively print entire buildings or structures in space or other challenging environments, similar to the way spiders spin webs. The robot's legs serve multiple purposes, including stabilizing, propelling, and positioning the deposition nozzle during printing. The most notable feature of the robot is its flexure bearing design. The robot's flexure bearings are driven by high-speed linear actuators and allow the deposition nozzle to be actuated with 5 degrees of freedom, including tip, tilt, x, y, and z. The surface being printed is constantly monitored by multiple sensors to ensure high precision. The robot's fine-positioning control can self-correct for unexpected vibrations and disturbances, and closed-loop control is used to produce high-quality structures. Overall, this innovative 3D printing robot has the potential to revolutionize the construction industry by enabling the creation of complex, delicate structures with high precision and speed.Demonstration Video:Compliant 6-Degree-of-Freedom Precision Motion Stage: The Hexblade PositionerRelated Inovation:High-Speed Large-Range Flexure-Based 6-Axis Stage.Potential Applications:High-resolution 3D printingUnmanned drones with 360\u00b0 high-speed cameras or scanning devicesRobotics or any teleoperation systemsAdvantages:Automated and fast 3D printing process in large scaleHigh precision and resolution for exotic configurationsFunctional in space and other challenging environmentsClosed-loop control systemDevelopment to Date:First description of complete invention (oral or written): 04/26/19.Related Papers:Yang, Zhidi, Ryan Lee, and Jonathan B.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA Researchers in the Department of Radiology have developed a computer-aided diagnostic model that uses histology slides to interpret and detect prostate cancer diagnoses with high levels of accuracy.Background:In the United States, prostate cancer ranks as the most prevalent and second deadliest cancer among men. Diagnosing this disease typically involves manual histology reviews of biopsied tissue, which helps determine both the cancer's aggressiveness and the appropriate treatment. During this process, a pathologist must meticulously examine histology slides to identify regions of interest (ROIs) that are crucial for accurate diagnosis. However, this method can be time-consuming and is susceptible to human error and variability. As a result, there is a growing demand for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to expedite and enhance the diagnostic process. Existing CAD approaches often require labor-intensive labeling and pre-identified ROIs provided by pathologists. Consequently, there is an urgent need for advanced CAD techniques capable of leveraging easily accessible pathology reports with minimal human intervention.Innovation:Dr. Arnold and colleagues developed a two-stage, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model for slide-level cancer grading and weakly-supervised ROI detection. In contrast to previous models that necessitate manual identification of ROIs by pathologists, this innovative method is trained solely using slide-level labels (weak labels) readily obtainable from pathology reports. The two-stage model first employs a lower-resolution approach to pinpoint potential regions of interest. Subsequently, it conducts a more in-depth analysis using a higher resolution, mimicking the process a pathologist would undertake during a manual histology review. Remarkably, this model achieved state-of-the-art performance, boasting an 85% accuracy rate in classifying benign, low-grade, and high-grade biopsy slides during an independent test.Patent:Systems and Methods for Automated Image AnalysisPotential Applications:\u2022    Cancer diagnosis\u2022    Histology screening\u2022    Computer-aided diagnosticsAdvantages:\u2022    High accuracy\u2022    Minimal human input required\u2022    Operates using weak labelsDevelopment to Date:Successful demonstration of invention reported in an independent testRelated Papers:An attention-based multi-resolution model for prostate whole slide imageclassification and localizationA multi-resolution model for histopathology image classification and localization with multiple instance learningReference:UCLA Case No. 2019-943Lead Inventor:Corey Arnold",

    "ip_description": "Summary: UCLA researchers from the Departments of Anesthesiology & Perioperative Medicine, Ophthalmology, Computational Medicine, and Computer Science have developed a novel uniform framework to diagnose disease-related risk factors in any volumetric medical imaging data.Background: Automated diagnosis of medical imaging is undoubtedly important as in most cases, in addition to reducing costs and treatment burden, it may ameliorate patient care. Many medical imaging diagnoses rely on 3D medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, and ultrasound (US) videos. Training an AI model to accurately measure disease-related risk factors in such volumetric medical imaging generally requires a large annotated dataset. However, the procurement of annotated volumetric-medical-imaging datasets is expert-time prohibitive (far more than 2D medical imaging) and thus, the existence of such datasets is very limited. Consequently, even if a transfer learning approach is being taken, conventional 3D-based AI vision models are practically bounded by a performance ceiling. Several attempts were undertaken to tackle volumetric medical imaging tasks with sparsely annotated training datasets on different data modalities. The main limitation of these approaches is that due to the limited data, they are tailored and optimized for a specific medical data modality. While each modality requires a specific treatment, there are commonalities across the different data modalities, and leveraging them can provide improved results across multiple modalities (even when data are limited) and a faster development time for future predictive models.Innovation: Dr. Avram and his research team have developed an innovative framework called SLice Integration by Vision Transformers (SLIViT) for detecting clinical features in volumetric imaging data. SLIViT employs cutting-edge computer vision techniques to extract features from each 2D layer and comprehensively integrates them to generate a single diagnostic prediction. Importantly, the unique architecture of the model allows pre-training on 2D annotated medical imaging data, which are more affordable to annotate and thus more accessible. The pre-training enables SLIViT to effectively learn visual features and leverage them to make predictions on 3D imaging data, which typically has fewer available annotations. SLIViT surpasses domain-specific state-of-the-art computer vision models in various learning tasks and data modalities demonstrating its utility and generalizability. When trained on less than 700 annotated volumes, SLIViT was also able to reach trained clinical specialists' performance, 5,000x faster illustrating its potential to reduce the burden on clinicians and expedite ongoing research.Press Release: UCLA Health: New AI model efficiently reaches clinical-expert-level accuracy in complex medical scansPublication: Accurate prediction of disease-risk factors from volumetric medical scans by a deep vision model pre-trained with 2D scansDemonstration Video: An AI method for diagnosing disease risk factors in 3D medical imaging data presented @ AI Week 2023Potential Applications: Volumetric imaging diagnostics (MRI, OCT, ultrasound)Disease quantification (cancer, retinal, cardiac, hepatic, and others)Treatment strategy improvementAutomated patients\u2019 prioritizationAdvantages: Leverages existing (and more affordable) 2D annotated dataOutperforms existing domain-specific computer vision modelsCompatible with any volumetric data modality and learning taskRobust to within-volume frames permutation (allowing it to handle chaotic datasets)Development to Date: A series of benchmarking comparisons were conducted to evaluate the performance of SLIViT in comparison to other models (SLIVER-net, EchoNet, and 3D ResNet) across various classification and regression tasks of retinal disease, cardiac function diagnosis, and hepatic fat content measurement using only the hundreds to thousands available annotated volumes per learning task.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Radiological Sciences have developed a new computational pipeline for identifying lesions in MRI data.Background:Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancer types with 12.6% of men diagnosed within their lifetime. Prostate cancer ranks as the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and contributes significantly to Medicare expenditures, recently ranking as the highest mean expenditure. Increasingly, current radiology-based detection methods rely on multiple MRI sequences to grade the appearance of lesions based on the radiologist\u2019s level of suspicion. However, the accuracy of this methodology is variable and highly dependent on the radiologist\u2019s experience. This is largely due to benign elements which obfuscate cancerous lesions and result in a persistent need to confirm suspicious findings with biopsy, a costly and highly invasive procedure. Moreover, reliance on multiple MRI sequences leads to long patient scan times. Improved quantitative methods are needed to exploit subtle MRI imaging findings that may not be readily appreciated by the trained radiologist.Innovation:Dr. Yeager developed an algorithm that allows radiologists to identify statistically significant focal T2-intense regions whose global clustering patterns have been implicated as a defining characteristic of prostate cancer. With this algorithm and analysis pipeline, there is potential for improved cancer screening accuracy and reduced need for physical biopsy by improving the diagnostic sensitivity of MRI. This algorithm could simplify the current complex MRI prostate scanning protocols down to a single sequence and significantly reduce the total scan time per patient. Additionally, automation of this algorithm has the added potential to streamline the radiologist\u2019s workload, diminishing the time spent to read each prostate study, as well as improving the radiologist\u2019s consistency.Potential Applications:\u2022    Prostate cancer identification\u2022    Lesion characterizationAdvantages:\u2022    Simple and interpretable algorithm\u2022    Characterizes pixel intensity distribution\u2022    Extendable analysis to differentiate other non-cancerous lesions\u2022    Reliance on a single MR sequence which directly translates to reduced MRI scan timeDevelopment to Date:A working pipeline has been developed for detecting benign and cancerous lesions based on a single MR sequence from data stored in the DICOM format.",

Static culture methods rely on diffusion to supply the growing tissue with necessary nutrients and oxygen, leading to stunted growth and hypoxic necrosis. Current state-of-the-art flow methods are not compatible with individual culture and require large amounts of media. In addition to relying on complex instrumentation, they do not allow for easy replication, and fail to generate uniform shear stress. Without uniform stress applied, cultured tissues fail to develop structural details necessary to better replicate in vivo experiments. There is a clear need for an ability to grow organoids more accurate to in vivo conditions.Innovation:UCLA researchers led by Professor Lin and his team have developed a novel, simple-to-use 3D tissue culture system which improves outcomes of stem cells developing into target tissues and reduces injury to cells due to lack of oxygen. This method is compatible with standard incubators using accessible 3D printed parts. The device is compatible with standard 96-well plates and is operable inside incubators while requiring less than a third of media compared to a spinner flask or bioreactor.

It\u2019s important that these electronic devices have material properties that closely resemble those of native tissues, such as stretchability, to ensure high-fidelity sensing and stimulation and reduce the risk of complications. However, achieving the required mechanical properties can sometimes hinder the electrochemical and electrical performance of these materials. Currently, clinical materials used in these applications are either made of stiff and brittle metals with good electrochemical performance or stretchable, polymer-based bioelectrodes that can exhibit a wide range of electrochemical performance. There is still an unmet need for highly active electrochemical devices that are insensitive to strain and exhibit favorable mechanical properties.Innovation:Dr. Emaminejad and colleagues have developed a new library of soft, stretchable, and strain-insensitive bioelectronics with brittle interfacial materials.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Radiology have developed an innovation algorithm that measures lung damage associated with COVID-19 using computed tomography (CT) data.Background:Computed tomography (CT) scans are essential in diagnosing and monitoring different types of lung damage. At present, radiologist manually inspect CT scans and provide non-standardized qualitative estimates. High resolution-computed tomography (HR-CT) scans with a quantitative aspect (QHR-CT) are being adopted to monitor the progression and recovery from respiratory diseases.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the devastating effects acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can have on patients. ARDS is a severe type of lung injury commonly seen in patients suffering from pneumonia and COVID-19. By some estimates, ARDS is responsible for up to 10% of all ICU admissions and carries a mortality rate above 30%. While QHR-CT have improved the quantitative analysis of pulmonary health, more sophisticated algorithms are needed to study and eventually predict the progression of chronically critically ill patients. There is a need for rapid and accurate technology to quantify lung capacity and damage in critical patients as well as track the recovery process.Innovation:UCLA researchers in the Department of Radiology, led by Dr. Grace Kim, have created a machine-learning algorithm that uses visual patterns from COVID-19 CT scans to determine the extent of lung damage caused by pulmonary disease. This innovative method includes two new markers of disease that other algorithms do not consider, resulting in a more accurate representation of pulmonary health.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA Researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a thin-film transistor-based image sensor that can quantify and identify bacterial colony forming units (CFUs) with high accuracy using a deep-learning algorithm.Background:Bacterial infections are a leading cause of death every year in both developed and developing nations, accounting for millions of deaths annually. The associated expense of treating bacterial infections cost more than $4 billion annually in the United States alone. Among bacterial infections, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and other coliform bacteria are the most common ones and typically transmitted via fecal contamination in water. The basic and most frequently used EPA-approved methods to test for the presence of these bacteria (EPA 1103.1 and EPA 1604) are bacterial-culture based methods. These traditional techniques take at least 24 hours for the read-out and necessitate expertise from the trained microbiology professionals for the final results. Nucleic acid-based approaches have been developed that produce results in less than a few hours, but these methods suffer from poor sensitivity and difficulty differentiating live versus dead bacteria\u2014and thus are not EPA approved for screening water samples. Other rapid identification technologies exist, but they suffer from limits in the volume of water that can be tested at once (< 0.1 L) or are operationally intensive to use. There is a growing need for a rapid bacteria colony determination method that is both operationally simple and capable of high throughput detections.Innovation:UCLA researchers have recently developed a thin-film transistor (TFT) based imaging sensor in conjunction with deep learning algorithms to rapidly identify and automatically count bacterial colonies and species on agar plates. The sensing system has an ultra-large imaging field of view and does not require mechanical scanning making it cost-effective, operationally simple to use, and portable. In addition to the foregoing advantages, this TFT based imaging method is free of any spurious result from the image processing step.  The combination of TFT-based imaging and the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques enable the differentiation between dead and living bacteria and can properly identify bacterial colonies in as little as six hours with high accuracy\u2014minimizing identification time by up to 12 hours.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:UCLA researchers in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics have developed a novel chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell manufacturing process to prevent premature CAR-T cell dysfunction and enhance CAR-T cell durability and potency.BACKGROUND:Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is an emerging pillar in cancer treatment and has provided remarkable patient response in select cancers including B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. CAR-T cell therapy takes advantage of the patient\u2019s own immune system, utilizing T cells drawn from the patient and modified in a laboratory setting with added receptors to better target cancerous cells. In most cases, the T cells isolated from a patient must be expanded to larger quantities ex vivo to result in a clinically efficacious response in patients; this step, however, introduces additional barriers and limitations. Current manufacturing processes are suboptimal as they utilize cell growth conditions that can lead to CAR-T cell dysfunction, ultimately reducing the applicability of the therapy. Tonic signaling, referring to CAR signaling activation in the absence of tumor-cell encounter, can further contribute to CAR-T cell dysfunction and lead to early T-cell exhaustion. Given the expanding need and market of CAR-T based therapies, there exists great clinical and economic incentive for improved manufacturing methods to limit or prevent T-cell dysfunction and subsequently increase the efficacy and duration of CAR-T therapy across multiple disease contexts.INNOVATION:Researchers at UCLA led by Dr. Yvonne Yu-Hsuan Chen in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics have developed a novel method of pre-conditioning CAR-T cells with pharmacological inhibitors to enable researcher-defined control over CAR-T cell tonic signaling. They found that when CAR-T cells were cultured in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors targeting a bevy of signaling pathways, the CAR-T cells demonstrated decreased activation and exhaustion marker expression. In in vivo murine models of lymphoma, survival could be altered depending on the CAR-T cell pre-conditioning regimen. Pre-conditioned CAR-T cells showed improved durability upon adoptive transfer into the lymphoma murine models. Taken together, a novel pharmacological inhibitor cocktail for pre-conditioning CAR-T cells during manufacturing could boost more rapid translation of novel CARs into the clinic.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022    Novel manufacturing process of CAR-T cells that can modulate tonic signaling as well as CAR-T cell function\u2022    Decrease the required iterations of CAR design-build-test cyclesADVANTAGES:\u2022    Decreases premature CAR-T cell exhaustion\u2022    Improves turnaround time for CAR-T cell therapy to be delivered to patients\u2022    Increases overall CAR-T cell therapy durability and efficacyDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:The researchers have demonstrated that their novel method of pre-conditioning CAR-T cells with a pharmacological inhibitor cocktail significantly reduces premature T-cell exhaustion and increases anti-tumor potency in multiple in vitro contexts and in vivo murine models.",

    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:UCLA researchers from the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics have developed a novel method to clone human T cell receptors from single lymphocytes.BACKGROUND:Immunotherapy is a growing therapy type for the treatment of disease, especially cancer, by activating or repressing the immune system. One major type of immunotherapy is Adoptive Cell Transfer (ACT). In ACT, peripheral blood monocyte cells (PBMCs) are harvested from a patient, modified to increase tumor cell recognition, and then re-introduced into the patient. The critical step of harvesting PBMCs from the patient is the lower incidence of treatment rejection: where several alternative immunotherapy options have had issues with successful adoption in the clinic. Currently, a critical bottleneck in the ACT treatment process is the isolation of T cells from the patient with a high affinity to the disease antigen. In this step, isolation of the mRNA sequence of the T cell receptor (TCR) that encodes the high affinity for targeted cells of the therapy must be done in such a way as not to degrade the sequence. While many potential methods in this process have been proposed, many are low throughput and not clinically translatable. Once the mRNA encoding the TCR is isolated, this sequence can be used to modify other T cells to selectively target cells: enriching the number of T cells that can effectively target and ablate cancer cells. Therefore, a desperate need exists to isolate cell-specific TCR sequences for the effective clinical translation of ACT.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers have developed a novel method to perform intracellular staining of T cells while preserving human TCR mRNA quality at the single-cell level. This technique allows for single-cell FACS sorting of human cytokine-producing cells, followed with TCR mRNA paired alpha and beta sequencing. UCLA researchers are able to generate cDNA sequences covering the variable regions of the TCR to allow reconstruction of the full-length TCRs and evaluate the function of individual clones in healthy donor PBMCs.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022    Cancer immunotherapy\u2022    Discovery of novel reactivities defined by phenotypeADVANTAGES:\u2022    Preserves TCR mRNA\u2022    Allows for analysis of up to 18 transcription factors and cytokines, depending on the FACSmachineDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:This approach has been confirmed with multiple peptide antigens, including well-described viral epitopes from cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus. UCLA researches have shown they can capture human, intracellularly stained T cells and single-cell sequence TCR alpha and beta pair cDNA. Identified clones have been cloned into retrovirus vectors and tested for reactivity to the cognate peptide in donor PBMCs. TCR clones have been tested for the ability to kill target cell lines expressing full-length CMB protein. Derived clones successfully recognize endogenous processed peptide and kill target cell lines at an efficiency comparable to clinical-grade TCRs used in adoptive cell therapies.Related Papers (from the inventors only)Thomsen, E.

Amongst the different types of T cell-based immunotherapy, adoptively transferred genetically engineered T cells, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, have shown substantial anti-tumor activity in patients with hematopoietic malignancies, but have so far demonstrated limited benefit in patients with solid tumors. CAR-T therapy is limited by the ability of adoptively transferred cells to expand and proliferatein vivoand maintain their anti-tumor function. Even those T cells that expand and persist can often become terminally differentiated and dysfunctionalin vivo. To mitigate these issues, patients undergo toxic conditioning regimens, including chemotherapy and radiation, to deplete the host immune system prior to adoptive transfer of engineered T cells. Thus, novel approaches of modifying the biology of adoptively transferred T cells to obviate conditioning chemotherapy while maintaining resilient anti-tumor functionsin vivocould make CAR-T therapies more clinically feasible and powerful, especially for solid tumors.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers led by Dr. Anusha Kalbasi in the Department of Radiation Oncology have engineered T cells with a cytokine receptor not commonly expressed on T cells, which endows the T cells with greater anti-tumor efficacy and new functions removing the need for conditioning chemotherapy. To show that the receptor platform successfully enabled redirection of signaling, the researchers stimulated modified T cells with its cytokine ligand, which resulted in specific and dose-dependent phospho-STAT signaling that was consistent with known signaling through the cytokine, and was not observed in unmodified T cells. They then tested the modified T cells in mouse models and saw that specific stimulation of the cytokine receptor signaling in vivo led to improved anti-tumor activity, without the need for conditioning lymphodepletion in a difficult-to-treat solid tumor model of melanoma. Therefore, by endowing T cells with signaling from a receptor not commonly seen in T cells, the T cells can gain new functions that lead to improved anti-tumor activity for hard-to-treat solid tumors.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022    TCR-engineered or CAR-engineered T therapy for cancer, especially solid tumors (in vivo use)\u2022    TCR-engineered or CAR-engineered T therapy for cancer, especially solid tumors (ex vivo use during manufacturing)\u2022    Cytokine / receptor-based drug developmentADVANTAGES:\u2022    Improved anti-tumor efficacy of adoptively transferred T cells\u2022    Removes the need for conditioning chemotherapy that can cause severe side effects for patients\u2022    Utilizes native signaling biology and avoids regulatory and safety issues of using synthetic proteinsDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:The researchers have demonstrated the success of this therapeutic method in mouse models.Related Papers (from the inventors only):Kalbasi, A., Siurala, M., Su, L.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a novel camera design that is capable of target-specific imaging with instantaneous optical erasure of irrelevant objects.Background:There are over 1 billion surveillance cameras around the world today, and the installation of such video surveillance technology will continuously grow due to increasing adoption of automation systems in public and private settings. In this digital era, privacy protection has become a rising problem. Moreover, the demand for digital computing power and data storage space is constantly growing to support the processing of massive amounts of visual data gathered every day. The basic and most commonly adopted image processing methods, such as image blurring, encryption, and deep learning-based algorithms, address privacy concern with software-based techniques. The intrinsic flaw of these techniques is that the sensitive information is only preserved after the recording and transmission of the raw data. Data breaches can still easily occur during image digitization and transmission, especially when captured from remote devices. Another set of solutions are implemented at the hardware level, in which the data processing happens before data transmission. However, they do not completely address the privacy concern, and exposure of confidential information can still happen during the digitization process. There are methods that can enforce privacy before the image digitization, but they are not widely adopted because of poor quality of the generated images, and such methods limit the further application of captured images for downstream tasks, i.e., human pose estimation. There is a growing need for a novel camera design that can generate images with desired quality while ensuring privacy and promoting sustainability.Innovation:Professor Ozcan and his research team have invented a novel camera design that can intervene into the light propagation and image formation stage to passively enforce privacy before raw data is recorded. This innovation provides a desired solution to both privacy and environmental concerns. The imaging system is comprised of diffractive layers that are trained using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and fabricated with a 3D printer.

    "ip_description": "Researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA have developed a non-contact force sensor that relies on laser speckle imaging to precisely sense changing forces on the surface of a variety of materials.Force sensing capabilities enable the ubiquity of a wide range of modern technologies, from touch screen in consumer electronics and autonomous vehicles to robotics feedback systems. Useful information can be obtained from such forces, such as the weight of an object or a user\u2019s intent, which can serve as new channels of information for intelligent interaction systems. Demand for smart force sensors is rapidly growing, particularly with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT). Conventional force sensors rely on contact sensors made of pressure-sensitive materials such as piezo films and discs or force-sensitive resistors. These contact-based sensors either require wiring, which offers little flexibility in its application, or operate on battery-powered, wirelessly-enabled systems which are costly to scale up. Additionally, contact-based sensors are sensitive when exposed to natural elements (e.g., moisture, rain), making repairs and replacement costly. These drawbacks further limit their potential applications for low-cost and passive objects such as 3D prints and room utilities. Additionally, contact-based sensors, on many occasions, might not be preferable to on-body interactions. There is an unmet need to produce a low-cost and robust non-contact force sensor that can be used in many environments for a wide array of applications.Professor Zhang and his research group have developed a non-contact force sensor bundle and processing algorithms to detect and quantify applied forces with high precision and accuracy. This invention, titled ForceSight enables ubiquitous fine-grain touch experience, a key interaction in everyday environments. The sensing capabilities of the minute surface deformations without users\u2019 exaggerated motions are realized by utilizing laser speckle imaging technologies. The principal phenomenon that this innovation relies on the discovery that surfaces of materials deform in the presence of force. These minute deformations can be quantified using an algorithm developed by Professor Zhang. The force sensor can be implemented on different everyday surfaces (wood, plastic, and metal) and exhibits high accuracy amongst these materials, and is robust to various sensing distances and calibration methods. This technology has been demonstrated in many real-world applications, including force-based material identification, touch screen sensing, and implementation as a force-sensor into 3D-printed materials. Implementation costs are negligible, as the entire sensor bundle costs less than $10 to manufacture.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:UCLA researchers in the Department of Medicine have discovered an enzyme that downregulates tumor expression levels of PD-L1/L2 in MAPKi-resistant melanoma with the potential to enhance cancer immune surveillance and therapeutic efficacy in drug-resistant melanoma. TITLE:   Methods to enhance cancer immune surveillance and therapeutic efficacy in melanoma by control of cancer cell-surface PD-L1/L2.BACKGROUND:Melanoma is one of the most common cancer types globally and the deadliest type of skin cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 100,000 new patients will be diagnosed with melanoma and 7,650 of these cases are expected to be fatal in 2022. Currently, two therapies have been developed to treat melanoma. One inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway, while the other regulates expression and activity of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligands, PD-L1 and L2. While MAPK inhibition (MAPKi) and anti-PD-1/L1 therapies effect antitumor responses by disparate mechanisms, around 50% of patients receiving either of these therapies develop resistance within the first year of therapy. As a result, researchers are exploring the rationally sequenced combination of these two therapies to help reduce resistance to either therapy. In response to both therapies, cancer cells can express high levels of PD-L1 and PD-L2 during quasi-mesenchymal transition, which enables cancer cells to metastasize and acquire resistance to treatments. Over the last decade, strategies to enhance cancer immune surveillance by reducing PD-L1 protein levels with post-translational modifications have been developed. However, no such strategy has been tested successfully in the clinic. INNOVATION:Researchers led by Dr. Roger Lo in the Department of Medicine have discovered an enzyme that regulates levels of PD-L1/L2 in tumor cells to prevent acquired resistance. Since targeted therapies, including MAPK inhibition in melanoma, leads to PD-L1/2 upregulation, UCLA researchers used mass spectrometry of immunoprecipitates from cells expressing PD-L2 to identify proteins that may regulate PD-L2 levels. They identified a ligase that binds to PD-L1/L2 and validated its mechanism and binding affinity to PD-L1/L2. To test its efficacy as a target for therapy, they conducted knockdowns and over-expression of the ligase in melanoma murine models that had undergone MAPK inhibitor therapy, and respectively saw acceleration and suppression of MAPK inhibitor resistance. Murine models with deficiency in the ligase showed less CD8+ T cell infiltration. Taken together, the researchers present a novel target for preventing development of resistance in melanoma.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022    Alleviate the immune evasion in immune checkpoint blockade therapy, including MAPK inhibitor therapy, PD-L1/2 targeted therapy, and combination therapies\u2022    Enhance cancer immune surveillanceADVANTAGES:\u2022    Novel target for drug development\u2022    Has broader implications for cancer as MAPK- and PD-1/L1-targeted therapies have shown clinical success in other cancer typesDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:The UCLA researchers validated the relationship between expression of the identified enzyme to cancer cell survival rate in 471 melanoma patients. They have demonstrated knockdown and over-expression of the identified ligase accelerates and suppresses, respectively, resistance development to MAPK inhibitor therapy in murine models.

Furthermore, they have outlined cellular targets in the tumor microenvironment with key roles in improving sensitivity to therapy.BACKGROUND:Programmed cell death protein-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/L1)- and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-targeted therapies have revolutionized the treatment of various cancers, notably improving the outcomes of BRAFV600* malignancies. For melanoma, wherein 50% of cases harbor BRAFV600* mutations, advanced standards of care consisting of MAPK inhibitors have increased the 5-year survival rate to almost 30%, but it remains low because the majority of patients acquire resistance to treatment within one year. Immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) with anti-PD-1 agents results in a more potent and sustained response in the 30%\u201340% of responding patients with BRAFV600 melanoma. Furthermore, recent data has shown that combination ICT with anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 agents reduces the rate of innate resistance from 60%\u201370% to 40%\u201350%. Current laboratory work and clinical trials are now focused on assessing the effects of combination therapy using anti-PD-1/L1 and MAPK inhibitors; however, the optimal timing, drug regimen, and sequence of administration for such combination therapies have yet to be elucidated.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers led by Dr. Roger Lo in the School of Medicine have developed a strategy combining PD-1/L1- and MAPK-targeted therapies to enhance and overcome resistance to treatment for melanoma. They tested various sequential and/or combinatorial regimens in subcutaneous murine tumor models driven by BRAFV600 and found a regimen that led to increased anti-tumor efficacy, suppression of therapeutic resistance, and increased response durability. Using this regimen, the researchers also observed activity against melanoma brain metastasis. They further validated their findings in other cancer models including an Nras mutant, Nf1 mutant melanoma, as well as Kras mutant colorectal carcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Additionally, the researchers sampled the treated tumors and used immune cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) to identify the specific tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subpopulations that were elicited by the regimen.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:UCLA researchers in the Department of Bioengineering have developed valency-mediated cytokine improvements, enabling the development of significantly more specific cytokine therapies.BACKGROUND:Cytokine therapy, in the growing arsenal of immunotherapies, aims to enhance, suppress, or alter the function of certain immune cells in a highly specific manner. Cytokines play an integral role in the cellular communication of the immune system, modulating both innate and immune responses. Many advances have been made to increase the specificity of cytokines for specific target cell populations through protein engineering. An example of the beneficial translation of protein engineering can be seen in the case of interleukin-2 (IL-2). Low-dose IL-2 leads to the expansion of regulatory T cells, with beneficial effects in several autoimmune diseases. Engineered binding affinity changes for IL-2Ra over IL-2Rb have led to marked efficacy increases and reductions in toxicity over native IL-2. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of protein-engineered cytokines is stymied by the complexity of their binding to target cells and their activation mechanisms. Significant off-target effects are still seen because of signaling through other IL-2-responsive cellular targets such as NK cells. Therefore, a need exists to further improve the selectivity of IL-2 and other cytokine therapies.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers in the Department of Bioengineering have developed an alternative route toward obtaining cell-selective cytokines. By profiling various immune cell populations and comparing the responses to a computational model, they determined how cytokine structure influences response. While protein sequence changes can alter the relative affinity of cytokines toward different receptors, these changes do not provide selectivity between cells expressing different receptor amounts. Due to the observation that on-target and off-target cells express the same receptors, just in varying amounts, protein sequence changes can only achieve an upper limit of selectivity. Instead, the researchers found that changes in cytokine valency could improve selectivity based on receptor density. High valency effectively enabled enhanced selectivity toward cells with high receptor abundance; bivalent cytokines increased selective regulatory T cell binding up to 5-fold compared to their monovalent counterparts. Furthermore, researchers predicted and experimentally verified that tetravalent cytokines produce even greater cell selectivity. This approach may allow cytokine treatments in many pharmaceutical pipelines to achieve greater target specificity with reduced toxicities.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS\u2022    Further improvement of cytokine specificity\u2022    Immunosuppressive cytokine therapy (e.g., autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection)\u2022    Immune stimulatory cytokine therapy (e.g., cancer immunotherapy)ADVANTAGES:\u2022    First to show the potential superiority of tetravalent immune-modulatory cytokines\u2022    Multiple implementation strategies to obtain high-valency cytokines\u2022    Expected to be synergistic with affinity changes through alterations in cytokine sequenceDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:A panel of IL-2 designs, including both muteins and Fc fusion structures, were profiled.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed an all-optical diffractive network that can find applications in machine learning-related vision tasks and all-optical computing systems.Background:Optical computing is a gateway to the future, as it can revolutionize computation by making classically stubborn problems solvable. Compared to classical computing schemes, an optical computing system requires little to no power to operate. At this moment, countless computing devices that store and process unprecedented amounts of data are consuming non-renewable power heavily. In 2019, the electric power consumed by the global data centers reached around 190 billion kilowatt-hours, and the data centers in the U.S. consumed approximately 40% of it. Another key factor fueling the growing interest in optical computing is the massive progress achieved in artificial intelligence. Together with transformative hardware advances\u2014including innovations in autonomous driving, remote sensing, robotic systems, smart homes, surveillance, and the Internet of Things\u2014the development of practical optical computing systems represents a paradigm shift in machine learning-related tasks, especially for visual computing applications. Despite many research works conducted, currently, no optical computing system is matured enough to perform computations that traditional computers could. In order to quickly complete future artificial intelligence tasks that require low-power execution, there is a clear need for a novel computing framework.Innovation:Professor Ozcan and his research team have invented a single diffractive network that is operated optically to enable multiple arbitrarily-selected linear transformation operations with complex values. In this all-optical system, the computational task is completed as the light passes through thin and passive optical elements, so the execution is performed at the speed of light, and the process does not consume power except for the illumination light. It utilizes standard isotropic diffractive materials, which make the fabrication cost-effective and scalable. Compared to traditional methods to employ multiple diffractive subsystems, this innovation applies polarization multiplexing in a single diffractive network, and integrates multiple tasks within the same system, rendering it better in terms of speed, versatility, and compactness. Additionally, the computing capacity of this diffractive network can be improved further, as the polarization multiplexing can be flexibly coupled with other multiplexing methods.Potential Applications:\u2022    All-optical high-throughput processors\u2022    Machine vision computing systems\u2022    Polarization-aware optical information processing systems\u2022    Artificial intelligence tasks\u2022    High-performance general-purpose processing systems\u2022    Optical information processing (e.g., object classification & image reconstruction)\u2022    Quantitative phase imagingAdvantages:\u2022    Processing at the speed of light\u2022    Low-power execution\u2022    Simple design and common materials selection\u2022    Easy fabrication with great scalability\u2022    Versatile, compact, and cost-effective systemDevelopment to Date:First successful demonstration (first actual reduction to practice): July/2021.Related Papers:Li, J., Hung, Y.C., Kulce, O., Mengu, D. and Ozcan, A., 2022.Polarization multiplexed diffractive computing: all-optical implementation of a group of linear transformations through a polarization-encoded diffractive network.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a touch-based sensor for non-invasive, real-time, and accurate lithium-ion monitoring in patients.Background:Lithium salt is one of the most widely utilized psychiatric medications for individuals with bipolar disorder. However, it is difficult to translate its effectiveness into positive patient outcomes due to its narrow therapeutic window, severe adverse effects if overdosed, and poor adherence rate from patients (~60%). Lithium monitoring is one tool to overcome the drawbacks of lithium salt treatment. Traditionally, lithium monitoring for precision dosing is carried out at centralized hospitals and involve invasive blood draws with expensive and sluggish lab-based analysis techniques. Indirect lithium intake monitoring (e.g., pill counters) are available but incapable of verifying actual intake events. Non-invasive, direct lithium monitoring exists, albeit with poor accuracy due to drifting of lithium concentration signals and poor readout stability. There remains an unmet need for direct, accurate, and real-time lithium monitoring.Innovation:Prof. Emaminejad and his team of researchers in the UCLA Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a touch sensor capable of determining lithium-ion concentrations. Recent studies have shown that many circulating biomarker molecules partition onto the fingertip surface with high flux. By taking advantage of this flux, lithium ions can be sensed in-situ via a touch of a finger. Combining aspects of ion-selective electrodes and thin hydrogel coatings, this innovative sensor overcomes instability issues often associated with typical sensing modalities, leading to accurate and non-invasive lithium monitoring.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA Resident Physician, Dr. Kyle Klingbeil, MD., in the Molecular, Cellular & Integrative Physiology (MCIP) program and Karie Villanueva, MD., have developed a novel image-guided surgery (IGS) modality that utilizes non-invasive, real-time high-resolution imaging techniques to better guide surgeons during operations.Background:Intraoperative imaging systems are extremely beneficial for surgeons to more precisely image and visualize anatomical parameters during surgery. Image-guided surgery (IGS) has become a revolutionary technique for the treatment of various hard-to-treat carcinomas. The most commonly accepted IGS technology is near-infrared fluorescence (NIR) imaging that creates high-quality images by exposing a light-emitting molecule, or a fluorophore, under a 700-900 nm wavelength light source. However, there are only a handful of suitable fluorophores; the most widely used, indocyanine green (ICG), suffers from unfavorable aggregation properties, instability, and poor sensitivity. The process of approving new fluorescent labels is time consuming and limits the development and advancement of this technique. Fluorophore-free technologies (i.e. thermoacoustic imaging) have become popular alternatives in recent years. This technique provides enhanced visualization capabilities as well as functional information. However, there is no standardized procedure or system to obtain images. Other high-resolution imaging techniques are either preoperative or operationally intensive to use, limiting their utility. There is a growing need for a novel intraoperative imaging device that can produce high quality images in real-time while mitigating risk and complications of operations.Innovation:UCLA Resident Physician, Dr. Kyle Klingbeil, MD., and his colleague have recently developed a real-time, high-resolution infrared imaging technology for intraoperative use. This technology combines existing advancements in thermal imaging coupled with novel applications within various surgical procedures to provide functional, anatomic, and pathological information. This technology is a real-time imaging technique, incorporated into a hand-held device or an attachment for existing surgical devices. It produces high-resolution images and does not require any fluorescent agent, making it ideal in certain instances such as plastic surgery, transplant surgery and surgical oncology. The use of a real-time, high-resolution infrared imaging system during medical procedures can effectively reduce perioperative complications and increase positive patient outcomes. The combination of this technology with diagnostic devices can improve diagnostic ability, as well as reduce operation times. Lastly, this imaging technology is non-invasive which minimizes negative side effects as well as the patient's discomfort and recovery time.Potential Applications:\u2022    Image-guided surgery: intraoperative imaging tool\u2022    Enables virtual operations, telementoring, robot-assisted surgeries, etc.\u2022    Theranostics\u2022    Monitoring for industrial complex and large-scale infrastructure systemAdvantages:\u2022    Real-time and high-resolution imaging\u2022    Non-invasive\u2022    Mitigates surgical complications\u2022    Reduces operative time\u2022    Avoidance of erroneous injuriesDevelopment to Date:First description of complete invention has been accomplished.Reference:UCLA Case No. 2022-296Lead Inventors:Dr. Kyle Klingbeil, MD; Karie Villanueva, MD.",

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA Researchers in the Department of Radiological Sciences have developed a deep learning-based approach for super-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. This method incorporates a novel slice-profile transformation super-resolution framework for through-plane super-resolution of multi-slice 2D MRI. This approach results in  higher accuracy and improved clinical assessment when compared to current super-resolution MRI approaches.Background:Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique that uses a magnetic field and computer-generated radio waves to create detailed images of organs and tissues in the human body. MRI is the most frequently used imaging instrument for the brain, spinal cord and other organs and is widely accepted in diagnostic procedures. The data from conventional 2-dimensional (2D) MRI scans can be viewed into multiple imaging planes, such as coronal and axial images, but its clinical utility is limited due to a thicker through-plane resolution. Therefore, alternative approaches are to acquire other 2D MRI scans in orthogonal imaging planes to allow multiple imaging views, but this method suffers from extended MRI acquisition times, which reduce their clinical applicability. A common practice using deep learning super-resolution (SR) MRI to circumvent these issues has become increasingly popular but, in most cases, have only shown promise in achieving high in-plane resolution, not through-plane resolution. Applying deep learning to improve through-plane resolution is still challenging due to the difficulties of achieving proper training for deep learning models. Novel deep learning MRI techniques for high through-plane resolution could revolutionize the efficiency and accuracy of using MRI in diagnosis and guided treatment.Innovation:UCLA researchers led by Dr. Kyung Sung in the Department of Radiological Sciences have developed a novel slice-profile transformation super-resolution (SPTSR) framework with deep generative learning for through-plane super-resolution (SR) of multi-slice 2D MRI imaging. After training their framework with 3,453 clinical subjects, they validated the framework in 392 patients and had two genitourinary radiologists qualitatively evaluate images taken with the framework in 50 patients. They found that this approach overcomes some of the current limitations of conventional approaches and reduces the need for acquiring additional orthogonal imaging planes. Furthermore, this method helps address the physical discrepancies between slice-encoding and frequency/phase-encoding in 2D MRI. Their novel approach is applicable across various disease contexts and results in higher accuracy imaging and reduced MRI acquisition time, making it a valuable tool in clinical settings to increase patient care and reduce the time burden on clinicians.Potential Applications:\u2022    Improves multi-slice 2D MRI imaging\u2022    Physics-informed down-sampled 2D MRI scans can be used for other data processing procedures\u2022    Synthesizes 3D MRI volumes from serial multi-slice 2D MRI scansAdvantages:\u2022    Faster MRI acquisition time\u2022    Low noise level, including reduced smear effect\u2022    Reduction of stair-case artifact\u2022    Higher overall image quality and resolution for greater diagnostic confidence and depthDevelopment to Date:The researchers trained and validated the framework in 3453, 392, and 50 clinical subjects, respectively.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a minimally-invasive wearable device that continuously monitors pharmaceutical concentrations in a user to optimize the drug\u2019s dosage.Background:The annual cost of medication-related morbidity and mortality due to non-optimized pharmacotherapy was estimated as $528 billion, equivalent to 16% of total US health care expenditures in 2016. Thus, personalized medication is required to achieve widespread well-being. The medication dosage is usually dependent on the drug manufacturer's suggestion, which is based on statistical averages from trials with a very limited patient sample size. Consequently, the suggested dosing may fall beyond an individual's optimal therapeutic concentration window, resulting in adverse effects and ineffective treatment.To promote personalized medication, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is often utilized to measure the concentration of medication in a patient\u2019s blood, and ensures the consumed concentration is both safe and effective. However, current TDM solutions are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. Patients are committed to frequent blood draws and long wait times that prohibit adequate and timely intervention. Therefore, there is a need for new TDM solutions that can continuously measure the circulating concentration of a drug. Clinical staff may adjust the dosage appropriately to optimize a patient\u2019s health and well-being.Innovation:UCLA researchers led by Professor Sam Emaminejad have developed a wearable, minimally invasive device that can monitor drug concentrations within a patient. The innovation can serve as a critical component to solve the grand healthcare challenge: non-optimized medication therapy. It incorporates both real-time sensing and machine-learning based analytical capabilities together. The actual monitoring device is in a typical body worn patch design, which limits discomfort and intrusiveness for the end user. From the manufacturer\u2019s perspective, this simple design, in comparison with the traditional sensor-on-microneedle fabrication, is more scalable and practical for widespread implementation.The mechanical features and fouling resistance of the device have been extensively tested in experiments, and the findings have shown substantially improved mechanical robustness and bio-fouling resistivity. Compared to the classical way of assessing personalized medication dosing, the UCLA invention can achieve real-time monitoring with a minimally invasive method to measure the circulating medication in the interstitial fluid (ISF). This invention can also investigate the performance profile of a broad range of drugs, both electroactive and non-electroactive, due to the versatile sensing interfaces with built-in signal enhancement capabilities. In the matter of data analytics, this solution utilizes the physiologically inspired machine learning inference models to predict the drug\u2019s performance profile with an improved accuracy for different end users.

This task, however, is nontrivial, due to the high structural complexity of biomolecules and the general difficulties in predicting their behaviors. Inspired by natural self-assembling biomolecules, such as protein capsids in bacterial cells, protein assemblies are emerging as a potential novel system for achieving molecular sensing. Recent bioengineering methods, many pioneered by the Yeates laboratory, have made it possible to create a diversity of self-assembling protein cages with novel compositions, shapes, structures, and ultimately, applications. However, typical protein cages must undergo lengthy re-engineering and design efforts for each new target protein. Thus, more facile and modular methods to adapt protein cages to sense different targets and elicit diverse responses could enhance and expand their utility in a wide variety of applications.\n\nINNOVATION:Researchers at UCLA led by Dr. Todd Yeates in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry have engineered a universal protein cage that is readily adapted for the sensing and responding to the presence of any target protein. Since they previously demonstrated the broad utility of structurally diverse protein cages, including applications in displaying enzymes or viral antigens on the surface and encapsulating nucleic acids, the researchers chose two specific structures, T33-31 and T33-51 to model their advancements. After attaching a \u2018modular adaptor\u2019 protein to the surface, they demonstrate via size exclusion chromatography that the cages remain stable in the absence of the target protein to which the adaptor was selected to bind, and expose their interior once the target protein binds. To enhance possibilities for dose-dependent responses, the researchers designed the construction such that the binding of a target protein to one adaptor protein causes it to either collide with neighboring cage subunits or with other copies of the target protein. Taken together, the universal protein cages offer a sense-and-respond system with broader applications.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022    A universally adaptable system for sensing and responding to a wide variety of target molecules for molecular diagnostics, biosensing, and in-situ biomarkers\u2022    Protein cages can be designed to open and release various biological compounds or signaling molecules in applications such as targeted drug delivery\n\nADVANTAGES:\u2022    Can be readily adapted for sensing of essentially any target protein\u2022    Diverse modes of signaling upon cage opening, depending on the enclosed molecular species.\u2022    Vast possibilities for the internal component, including drugs, nucleic acids, polypeptides, fluorescent motifs\u2022    Unlimited architectural designs of protein cages that broaden their utility\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:The researchers have previously demonstrated the use of protein cages for various applications. Here, they used modeling and experimental tests to demonstrate a more advanced type of protein cage design, which critically introduces the capacity for cage-opening in response to diverse cellular proteins of interest, in a dose-dependent fashion.  The researchers have demonstrated multiple types of readouts upon cage opening, including fluorescence unquenching and luminescence by enzyme complementation.",

With global meat consumption at an all-time high, new, more sustainable sources of meat are being developed. Cultured meat, a form of cellular agriculture, can sustainably produce muscle from a bioreactor that uses in vitro animal cells. The grown meat aims to mimic the texture of conventional meat, a trait that is defined by its general mechanical properties and the ability of the muscle cells to contract. To improve the properties of the meat during its growth, various strategies have been developed including mechanically stretching the cells, electrical stimulation, and seeding cells onto hydrogel scaffolds. However, these manipulations are challenging to implement at scale and fail to reduce costs of cultured meat production. Therefore, there is a need for a scalable technique that can improve the overall texture and quality of cultured meat.Innovation:UCLA researchers in the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology have developed an approach to enhance the texture and quality of the cultured meat products. This method can increase the levels of protein content of the cultured meat and meat nutrient value. It can also enhance its mechanical properties, improving its overall texture.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:Researchers in UCLA\u2019s Department of Microbiology, Immunology & Molecular Genetics have developed an off-the-shelf cell therapy method for reduction of Graft vs Host Disease (GvHD) following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This approach uses engineered third-party iNKT\u2019s to ameliorate severity of GvHD without negatively impacting treatment potency.BACKGROUND:Worldwide it is estimated that over 40,000 patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to treat or cure various diseases including bone marrow failure syndrome, hematologic malignancies, and numerous immunodeficiencies. While the use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the current standard of care for various maladies, it is not without drawbacks, as within the first year following the procedure up to 70% of patients experience some form of acute Graft vs Host Disease (GvHD). This is a potentially serious complication where the donor\u2019s T cells (the graft) view the patient\u2019s healthy cells (the host) as foreign, and attack and damage them. Amongst these patients, some develop a chronic condition of GvHD which can last several years to a lifetime. Despite the risks of GvHD, for various pathologies allo-HSCT is the only available form of curative treatment. As a result, there is an unmet need for and great interest in the development of additional accompanying treatment modalities that can reduce the severity of both acute and chronic GvHD. Previous approaches attempting to reduce GvHD have been thus far unsuccessful due to adverse side-effects or the inadvertent reduction of allo-HSCT\u2019s efficacy.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers led by Dr. Lili Yang from the Department of Microbiology, Immunology & Molecular Genetics previously developed a scalable method for engineering invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells via TCR gene engineering of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vivo. They have now further expanded on this approach and developed an ex vivo culture method to produce third party human iNKT cells in mass. These third party / \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d cells have shown the capacity to effectively reduce the GvHD associated phenotypes through the elimination of antigen-presenting myeloid cells. Testing in both in vitro and xenograft preclinical models of lymphoma and leukemia demonstrated that these third-party HSC-iNKT cells reduced GvHD without dampening the treatment efficacy of transplanted allogeneic T cells. Taken together, the HSC-iNKT cells are a promising off-the-shelf cell therapy candidate for GvHD prophylaxis.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022    Treatment of graft-vs-host disease\u2022    Supplementary treatment following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantationADVANTAGES:\u2022    Reduction of graft-vs-host disease\u2022    Better maintains graft vs disease activity than alternatives\u2022    Production and engineering of these HSC-iNKT cells is scalable: thousands of doses can be generated from a single donor\u2022    MHC matching is not neededDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:HSC-iNKT cells have been developed and shown to closely resemble subsets of endogenous human iNKT cells in phenotype and functionality.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Bioengineering have built a new cell sorting system that can handle and maintain linear flow control for a broad range of mesoscale particles in fluids.Background:The global market for drug discovery technologies was valued at $65.3 billion in 2019, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.6%. The growing field of drug discovery and development is enabled by the automation technologies that can further reduce spiraling costs and alleviate the stringent timelines associated. Automating the identification and manipulation of bioparticles in fluids forms the cornerstone of future biomedical laboratories. Current automated flow manipulation can be broadly divided into 2 techniques: robotic liquid handling and flow cytometry. Robotic liquid handling technologies are specially designed for millimeter-scale particles and reaction volumes, whereas microfluidic and flow cytometry technologies are made for single cells and microscale particles. Automating the flow manipulation of mesoscale particles, therefore, is challenging as they sit in the gap between commercial flow manipulation technologies. Those bioparticles are too small to be correctly handled by the robotic handling methods during liquid transferring. At the same time, they are too large to have negligible inertia and may block flow cytometers or microfluidic channel flows. Moreover, to decipher the complex yet fragile structures of the newly developed mesoscale bioparticles, an automated and scalable high-content screening method with modular flow control is required. Therefore, a real-time analysis and sorting system is necessary to precisely control flow manipulation of mesoscale particles in a consistent manner.Innovation:Professor Di Carlo and his research team have invented a novel manipulation system for mesoscale biological objects by a series of robotic micro-motors. Utilizing this manipulation system with image-based feedback, a fully-automated bioparticle sorting solution is successfully developed. This invention will serve as a critical component to eliminate the gap left by the current commercial sorting solutions. Compared to the conventional flow manipulating techniques, this technology handles bioparticles in a broad size range (100 \u00b5m to 1 mm) and various shapes. The mechanism behind motor driven flow is well understood and applied in this UCLA innovation to realize linear control and precise sorting of the mesoscale particles in diverse biocompatible carrier fluids.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering have developed a new type of meta-material that can actively adapt its mechanical properties from exposure to external stimuli.Background:As technologies have evolved, humans developed new methods to produce unique materials, such as plastics, steels and composites, whose mechanical properties can be customized during production to meet a particular demand. These methods have allowed for the tailored synthesis and production of materials with novel and desirable mechanical properties. However, once the material is chosen and manufactured into a device or product, its mechanical properties are usually fixed. There are limited examples of materials, such as shape memory polymers and piezoelectric ceramics, that exhibit varying mechanical properties after production. However, these materials are subject to their physical limits, difficult to control, and do not possess the inherent capability to learn. They therefore cannot achieve a specified mechanical property in response to varying external stimuli. There remains an unmet need for smart materials that are tunable and responsive to their environment.Innovation:Professor Hopkins and his research team have invented a new kind of architected meta-material referred to as mechanical neural networks (MNNs). These consist of an array of interconnected tunable beams which are driven by forces or displacement inputs. It is a physical embodiment of an artificial neural network (ANN) that can autonomously adapt its mechanical properties via prolonged exposure to external forces. The MNN is able to learn and control its bulk mechanical properties (e.g., shape morphing, acoustic wave propagation, and mechanical computation) and bulk properties (e.g., Poisson\u2019s ratio, modulus, and density) by actively tuning the local properties/stiffness of each individual beam. This invention is the first mechanical meta-material that shows learning capabilities analogous to how the ANNs map inputs to outputs. Additionally, the tunable beams used in this invention can be replaced by a variety of materials that continuously exhibit the desired mechanical properties previously learned from an external influence. This new type of meta-material introduces a novel class of smart, artificially intelligent materials.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering & Bioengineering have developed a constant flow path mechanical ventilator used for the treatment of advanced respiratory diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).Background:Respiratory failure leading to the need for respiratory support is a very serious problem that may yield a lower functional lung volume and decreases the ability of the patient to successfully perform gas transfer with the alveoli in the lungs, thus limiting the intake of oxygen and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Mechanical ventilators are designed to treat a wide range of respiratory issues, including pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and more. A mechanical ventilator is a machine that takes over the work of breathing when a person is not able to breathe sufficiently on their own. Mechanical ventilation can be noninvasive in cases of a milder degree of respiratory insufficiency, or invasive requiring endotracheal intubation. Endotracheal intubation is a procedure by which an endotracheal tube (ETT) is inserted through the mouth into the trachea. Modern mechanical ventilators utilize variable flow valves and orifices. These devices are cost prohibitive, difficult to produce, difficult to service, and require significant training to operate. They are not appropriate for low-resource settings or as a broad public or global health tool. Thus, there is a need in the art for an improved mechanical ventilator system that can better address these obstacles.Innovation:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering & Bioengineering have developed a mechanical ventilator that operates with a set of flow paths. The invention consists of at least one orifice plate and valve flow paths to create a constant flow rate of gas across the ventilator with the principle of \u201cchoked flow.\u201d It makes use of a series of flow paths, which allow for optimization of system design while allowing for improved simplicity and flexibility in controlling the various parameters for the ventilator. Upstream of the valve and orifice is a constant pressure source which ensures that the flow rate across each orifice of a given diameter does not change with time. This reduced complexity in the electromechanical design of the ventilator allows for a device that is very straightforward to manufacture and is designed for ease of use and control. The ventilator has been extensively tested on the benchtop at the UCLA Simulation Center and its performance compared with an FDA cleared critical care ventilator.

Transport limitations of ions, however, may lead to the polarization of electrolytes within lithium-ion batteries. This is particularly an issue with EVs as they undergo many high current charge/discharge cycles during rapid charging, dynamic acceleration, and regenerative braking resulting in severe polarization that limits the battery\u2019s efficiency.

    "ip_description": "Background:Broadband pulse generation has a wide range of applications such as high-speed communication, high-resolution radars, spectroscopy, and remote sensing. Techniques to increase bandwidth and radiation power have generated great interest in terahertz (THz) and mm-wave research but are hindered by the limitations of silicon-based technologies. Methods to overcome these limitations have included the use of dynamic pulse generation but programming the phase and amplitude of tones at mm-wave/THz frequencies requires complex circuit blocks. Step-Recovery-Diodes (SRD) are popular for harmonic generation and frequency multipliers due to their ultra-sharp reverse recovery, yet SRDs are not available in silicon processes typically used in THz frequency generation devices. There is a need for SRD available in silicon processes for THz and mm-wave generation.Innovation:UCLA researchers have demonstrated a PIN diode-based THz pulse radiator implemented in a silicon-based process for broadband pulse generation. In this invention the reverse-recovery of a PIN diode is used to generate THz-pulses (wideband frequency comb), which are radiated through a wideband on-chip antenna. When used in an on-chip slot bow-tie antenna the THz pulse radiator demonstrated an efficiency above 60% over the band of radiation. The disclosed invention demonstrates higher radiation power at frequencies above 300 GHz, a flatter average ERIP spectrum, and lower power consumption (<50x) compared to the current state of the art THz broadband pulse generation.Potential Applications:High-speed communicationHigh-resolution radarsSpectroscopyRemote sensingAdvantages:Higher radiation power at frequencies above 300 GHzFlatter average ERIP spectrumLower power consumptionBackground:Terahertz (THz) detectors can play a key role in a diverse range of applications including measuring the speed of large moving objects and detecting and reconstructing sound over long distances. To be widely used in these areas, these detectors require additional hardware which decreases sensitivity. There is a need for improved THz detector technology to improve sensitivity and expand the potential applications for THz detectors.Innovation:UCLA researchers have built a terahertz (THz) detector with improved sensitivity. The custom picosecond pulse radiator uses the micro-Doppler phenomenon in the THz regime to improve the sensitivity of detection and accuracy of reconstruction of THz waves. The device was tested in the transmission and reconstruction through micro-Doppler of a ten-second music track and multiple frequency tones. The researchers used sound vibrations over a long frequency range (Hz to KHz) to modulate a carrier signal radiated from a digital-to-impulse silicon chip and the sound waves were recovered via frequency demodulation at the receiver.Potential Applications:THz detectorsRadarsMedical devicesMaterials identification/detectionImagingAdvantages:Utilizes micro-Doppler effectDetects vibration signals in THzDetects sound waves in THzRelated Materials:1S.

Babakhani, \"THz Micro-Doppler Measurements Based On A Silicon-Based Picosecond Pulse Radiator,\" 2019 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS), Boston, MA, USA, 2019, pp. 309-311.Development-To-Date:A prototype silicon-based picosecond pulse radiator was used to detect and reconstruct a ten-second music track. The device can detect and distinguish between sound tones from 100-400Hz and can use sound vibrations over the frequency ranges of 50 Hz to 1 KHz to modulate a 395.2 GHz carrier signal radiated from a digital-to-impulse (D2I) silicon chip.Background:Broadband integrated circuits in millimeter-wave and terahertz (THz) frequencies provide low-cost and compact solutions for high-resolution hyper-spectral imaging and molecular spectroscopy.  Non-linearity of the direct CMOS THz detectors based on the plasma-wave effect in MOS transistors recovers the power of the millimeter-wave/THz signal for building imaging arrays.  However, in order to develop hyper-spectral imaging systems or trace-gas spectrometers, coherent receivers are required to extract the frequency content.  Sub-harmonic mixers have been used in to coherently receive the sub-THz signals.  High-power LO signals are needed in these mixers to down-convert the received signal to low frequencies and multiple VCOs need to be implemented to cover a wide LO frequency range.Innovation:Researchers at UCLA have developed a millimeter-wave spectrum analyzer that uses a non-linear fast switch to generate a broadband frequency comb LO with a tunable repetition rate.  A broadband frequency comb with a frequency spacing of frep is used to detect the spectrum of any received signal within the same bandwidth.  An NFET is used as a broadband heterodyne plasma-wave detector to down-convert the received tones to distinguishable low frequency tones.  The receiver is operated from 30 to 160 GHz, where the maximum frequency is limited by measurement equipment.Potential Applications:High-resolution hyper-spectral imagingMolecular spectroscopyAdvantages:The receiver operates at a wide frequency range, thus no longer require to down-convert the received signalDevelopment-To-Date:The described millimeter-wave spectrum analyzer was tested experimentally.Background:Efficient THz generation in silicon technologies has been of great interest over the recent years, as it enables an integrated low-cost solution for sensing, radar, communication, and spectroscopy.

    "ip_description": "Background:Over the past two decades, silicon chips have decreased in size by 1000x, while packages on circuit boards have only shrunk by 4x. This will eventually limit scaling of integrated circuits and subsequent processor performance. A solution is the invention of platforms for packageless integration of heterogeneous dies, such as silicon interconnect fabric (Si-IF), exhibiting significant improvements in thermal and electrical properties. Silicon Interconnect Fabric (Si-IF) is a material placed on a silicon wafer that connects multiple bare dielets, allowing for quicker signaling speeds and improved energy efficiency. This silicon-silicon based material may eventually replace printed circuit boards (PCBs) and offer promise in the field of smaller, wearable electronics which require compact processing units.2020-861 Superconducting Silicon Interconnect Fabric (Superconducting-IF)Background:Quantum computing is an essential part of next generation heterogeneous computing. The computational unit, quantum bit, is very sensitive to energy loss and noise, especially thermal noise. Although various types of quantum computers exist, superconducting quantum computers are an excellent candidate to reduce the mentioned noise and loss problems. Superconducting quantum computers utilize integration method bumps to adhere superconducting dies to substrates. It is impossible, however, to manipulate the height of the bumps with current integration methods during fabrication when the area of the wetting layer is fixed. This has also limited fabrication of silicon interconnects to above cryogenic and below superconducting temperatures.  Therefore, a method that can extend the temperature of interconnects and control the height of integration method bumps during fabrication is needed.Innovation:Superconducting-IF is a platform that allows heterogeneous integration of dies with controlled bump height on silicon wafers and extends the fabrication of silicon interconnects to cryogenic and superconducting temperature ranges. The platform has been successfully prototyped and demonstrated to achieve 10 \u03bcm interconnect pitches. The Si-IF is an advanced packaging technology that possesses fine-pitch (\u226410 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a), metal-to-metal bonding, high bandwidth, and low latency characteristics. The platform also has low power generation and low power dissipation and also extends the ability to integrate bumps above cryogenic and below superconducting temperatures.Related Materials:Yu-Tao Yang et al., \u201cDemonstration of Superconducting Interconnects on the Silicon Interconnect Fabric Using Thermocompression Bonding,\u201d IEEE 70th Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC), Jun 1-30, 2020, Vista, FL.STATE-OF-DEVELOPMENTDevelopment to Date:Platform has been successful prototyped and reduced to practice.2018-220 Network On Interconnect FabricBackground:Modern systems contain a variety of heterogeneous circuit blocks, and require ultra large-scale integration to accommodate different applications. Ideally, silicon interconnect fabric (Si-IF) is a compatible platform to satisfy the needs of modern systems through supporting integration of bare (unpackaged) dies using thermal compression bonding on a Si wafer substrate. Fine pitch horizontal and vertical interconnects are feasible within the Si-IF using standard Si processing techniques. However, to enable the Si-IF as a practical platform for ultra large-scale heterogeneous integration, system-level issues, similar to a large system on a chip, must be addressed.Innovation:Researchers at UCLA have developed a novel network on interconnect fabric (NoIF), which enables integration of ultra large-scale heterogeneous systems within the technologically mature Si-IF platforms. NoIF is based on utility dies that serve as intelligent nodes within the network.Potential Applications:NoIF offers a wafer-level framework to enable multiple services, including:Global and semi-global communicationPower deliveryConversionManagement, synchronization, testingAdvantages:Heterogeneous, ultra large-scale integrationRelated Materials:1B.

In this approach, a series of copper stubs are used to connect the back of the Si-IF to the socket. The front of the Si-IF is then powered using through wafer vias (TWVs), which penetrate the silicon substrate.

Popularity and demand for wafer-scale engines has grown steadily, serving as a potential solution to this dilemma. Silicon Interconnect Fabric (Si-IF) has been developed by researchers at UCLA in order to enable wafer-scale processing and dense integration of heterogenous dielet-silicon interactions to drastically improve processing power. These wafer-scale systems typically utilize through-silicon vias (TSVs) to supply power and communication to the system. However, manufacturing large wafer-scale systems with TSVs is expensive and complex, and uniform power and signal distribution not guaranteed.Innovation:UCLA researchers have developed an alternative solution to drilling TSVs that is cheaper, simpler to fabricate, and enables fine-pitch power and signal processing. This solution is a vertical connection by through-polymer-vias (TPVs) located between dielets, enabling signals and power to be routed around, between and under dies to enable uniform delivery. This solution is not limited to Si-IF-based engines and is proposed to improve upon processor designs in general.Potential Applications:Wafer-scale engine designHigh-performance computer designAdvantages:Improves processing capabilitiesAffordable and simple manufacturing vs. standard TSVsEnables heterogenous integration of microchipsImproves power and signal communicationRelated Materials:H.

The novel Si-IF assembly allows for agnostic dielet structuring and therefore heterogenous integration. The design of the Si-IF provides a platform to integrate a wafer-scale system constituted of a diverse array of dies, enabling high-performance computing.

These dual-mode optical microscopes are sensitive enough for protein and salt crystal distinction.  However, these microscopes require UV-grade optics, which are relatively bulky and expensive.

The introduction of CTT's can prove an invaluable tool for manufacturers, allowing them to turn stock logic transistors into multi-time programmable (MTP) non-volatile  memory elements that operate at logic compatible voltages without the need for  any additional processes or masks.2021-167 Non-Volatile SRAM Using Charge Trap TransistorsInnovation:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have designed an embedded non-volatile SRAM (nvSRAM), using Charge Trap Transistors (CTT) in a CMOS logic process, without any extra fabrication steps (such as floating gate). Because of its unique design, it can rapidly store data on chip and then quickly power down or enter a lower power mode as necessary. For example, when the memory is idle, its power supply can be turned OFF to eliminate the leakage power consumption by the idle memory. Once the power is back ON, memory can recall the original data. This design can be used as both regular SRAM and an embedded non-volatile memory (NVM) for IoT devices, implantable medical devices, systems that rely on power harvesting and see fluctuations in their power supply, and systems that work based on intermittent-computing methodology.Applications:Low-power-budget devicesCMOS Logic-based embedded non-volatile memoryIoT sensorsMedical devicesPower supply fluctuation resilient memoryAdvantages:Stores data despite power lossCan be used in designs with a low power budget or a fluctuating power supplyArea efficientImplemented in a CMOS logic-process with no extra fabrication step5Can be implemented in advanced nodes2020-770 Apparatus and Method for Changing the Functionality of an Integrated Circuit Using Charge Trap TransistorsInnovation:Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors (CMOS) are utilized for the generation of integrated circuits used in devices such as memory chips, microprocessors, and other digital/analog circuits. Miniaturization of CMOS circuits produces smaller transistors, which are faster and more power efficient. However, reduction in size often results in fabrication defects which can negatively impact the performance of the resulting chip and significantly reduce production yield. Methods to overcome these defects and calibrate the performance of CMOS wafers post-production are therefore vital to increase yield and decrease cost. UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a method to increase CMOS wafer yield through post-production modification. Enhancement in performance is achieved through calibrating the threshold voltage of a transistor by charge trapping. Importantly, this method does not incorporate any additional fabrication steps which are lengthy and costly. Overall, enhanced utility of produced CMOS wafers could result in significant downstream cost reduction of consumer electronics.Applications:ElectronicsMemory devicesServersComputers and tabletsWearable ElectronicsAdvantages:Reduces transistor mismatch electronically in post-fabricationFine tunes circuit parameters in a non-volatile fashionExtra fabrication steps are not required4Higher effective yield of produced CMOS wafers2021-125 Analog Nonvolatile Memory-Based In-Memory Computing Multiply-And-Accumulate (MAC) EngineInnovation:UCLA researchers led by Professor Iyer have developed a method to use Charge-Trap Transistors (CTTs) for analog nonvolatile memory-based multiply-and accumulate (MAC) systems.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a method titled Collaborative Memory ECC Technique (COMET), to efficiently detect two error correcting codes (ECC) and eliminate silent data corruption (SDC) when double-bit errors occur within DRAMs.Background:Technological abundance has been the prime driver of manufacturers increasing the capacity of the Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) modules for electronics such as computers, phones, and cars. DRAM manufactures have begun to adopt on-die error correcting coding (ECC) to deal with increasing error rates during usage. However, the on-die ECC can miscorrect double bit errors, which can result in triple bit errors more than 45% of the time. Triple bit errors are then undetectable or miscorrected in the memory controller more than 55% of the time, resulting in silent data corruption (SDC). Therefore, there is a need for a method that can improve the detection of silent data corruption when a double bit error happens to avoid further damage of data in the DRAM of electronics.Innovation:To solve this issue, UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed Collaborative Memory ECC Technique (COMET). This method efficiently co-designs two of the error correcting coding (ECC) codes to guarantee no silent data corruption when a double-bit error happens within the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Moreover, the method allows the collaboration between the on-die and in-controller ECC decoders that corrects most of the double-bit errors without adding any more redundancy bits to either of the two codes. Furthermore, COMET was able to eliminate all double-bit error induced silent data corruptions and corrected ~99.9997% of double bit errors with negligible data, power, and performance impact.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARYUCLA researchers in the Department of Psychiatry have developed novel methods to use human genomic DNA context to drive the expression of microglial-expressing Alzheimer\u2019s disease genes in mammalian cells or mammalian animal models.BACKGROUNDMicroglia are resident innate immune cells in the brain derived from myeloid precursors. Microglia contribute to synaptic plasticity and learning at the resting state, and reactive microglia mediate phagocytic uptake and secretion of inflammatory cytokines in response to injury or neurodegenerative disorders. While short-term microglia activation promotes tissue repair, chronic microglia activation in the case of Alzheimer\u2019s disease may elicit neurotoxicity and contribute to disease pathogenesis. TREM2 is a membrane protein selectively expressed in myeloid cells, including microglia. TREM2 plays a critical role in age-dependent microglial proliferation and survival, as well as proper function of microglia and myeloid cells in the context of age-dependent brain disorders. Recent Genome-Wide Association Studies in Alzheimer\u2019s disease identified genes that significantly modify the risk of late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease to have relatively enriched expression in microglia in human and mouse brains. And a number of these microglia-enriched, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease-associated genes also have genetic, physical, or functional interactions with TREM2, and appear to function in a broad TREM2 signaling pathway.INNOVATIONResearchers at UCLA have developed two strategies to express microglial-expressing Alzheimer\u2019s disease (ME-AD)-associated genes under human genomic regulation in mammalian cells or mammalian animal models. The mammalian cell models carrying human ME-AD genomic reporters are used to screen for molecules that can modulate the protein or RNA levels of ME-AD genes expressed from the human genomic reporters, and the mammalian animal models are used to test the ability of molecules to modulate the expression of ME-AD RNA or protein that are expressed from these reporters either in the brain (e.g. microglia), or in the periphery cells (e.g. myeloid cells).POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:1.The method is generalized to any ME-AD genes that are implicated in the regulation of microglia function and in pathogenesis of AD and related brain disorders that have implicated microglia in their disease etiology2.The method is suitable for identifying molecules that can affect the transcription, RNA splicing, trafficking and stability of ME-AD genes in the proper cell types under baseline conditions, or in a condition of environmental or disease-related challenges3.The method is suitable for high-throughput screening of molecules that either downregulate or upregulate the levels of ME-AD genes in cell models, and low-to medium throughput screen of any molecules that may regulate the expression of ME-AD genes in vivo in intact animals, both in the CNS or in the peripheral tissuesADVANTAGES:1.Screen and test molecules that can regulate the levels of human microglial-expressing Alzheimer\u2019s disease-associated RNA and protein from human genomic contextDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:Several cell models and animal models are available",

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a cost-effective cellphone-based micro-plate reader to rapidly perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) with >99% accuracy.Background:Immunoassays are biochemical tests that are conducted to measure the presence and concentration of large proteins or antibodies in a sample. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is a critical component of diagnostic testing within a heath care setting to mitigate the spread of dangerous bacteria. Commonly, an ELISA test is utilized to perform AST for accurate antibody or antigen recognition for the diagnosis of many important infectious diseases. Standard ELISA procedures may utilize microliter plates (i.e. 96-well plates) to analyze samples via colorimetric readouts. These colorimetric assays correlate color changes from chemical reactions to specific quantities of substrates. However, current preparation and analysis of ELISA tests require large integrated infrastructure that include robotic systems and multi-well scanning spectrophotometers, which are generally only available in high resource capacity regions. There is a pressing need for a fast and cost-effective method to analyze ELISA immunoassays to increase accessibility for point-of-care AST in developing regions.Innovation:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a cost-effective and hand-held smartphone-based ELISA immunoassay reader. The immunoassay reader is capable of performing rapid monitoring of microliter plates and analyzing the colorimetric changes of the ELISA test. The reader contains a unique optical fiber array-based smartphone attachment to capture the transmitted light from each well by the smartphone camera. Furthermore, compared to other micro-plate readers, the design provides a significantly more compact and light-weight imaging platform that did not suffer from optical aberrations.

    "published_date": "2021",
    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:UCLA researchers in the Department of Neurology have developed a novel small molecule to improve native gamma oscillations as a treatment for cognitive decline in various neurological disorders.BACKGROUND:Neural circuits are facilitated by brain oscillations or rhythmic electric activity at distinct frequencies. These frequency variations are critical for correctly linking together circuits of neurons in the central nervous system. These oscillatory activities are dependent on precise inhibitory-excitatory neuronal interactions. Oscillations at the frequency 30-120 Hz, also known as \u03b3-oscillations, are known to organize the neuronal circuits critical for learning and memory. Importantly, numerous studies also characterize reduction of \u03b3-oscillations in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as early cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease . Recent evidence suggests that stimulating brain frequencies in mouse models of Alzheimer\u2019s diseases is able to alleviate disease pathology. However, such approaches are not feasible in human cases of cognitive impairment due to the required duration of stimulation, lack of access to all brain regions, and misalignment with native brain oscillations.In humans, the generation of \u03b3-oscillations is regulated by the brain\u2019s parvalbumin (PV) expressing interneurons (PV+INs) that uniquely express \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs). GABAARs from interneurons have been shown to powerfully regulate the dynamics of \u03b3-oscillations. Thus, these receptors are ideal therapeutic targets to selectively increase \u03b3-oscillations throughout the brain. GABAARs, however, have been shown to be insensitive to benzodiazepines, popular small molecule drugs targeting brain activity. To effectively target these receptors as a means to treat cognitive impairment from neurological disorders, a novel class of small molecules must be designed.INNOVATION:Researchers at UCLA from Dr. Istvan Mody\u2019s group have proposed the use of small molecule new chemical entities (NCEs) to inhibit GABAARs. NCEs will increase \u03b3-oscillations by reducing the tonic inhibition of PV+INs. Unlike cranial stimulation, this approach will amplify naturally occurring \u03b3-oscillations through activity of PV+INs resulting in improved cognitive function. Dr. Mody\u2019s research has validated this concept by identifying small molecules that reduce receptor expression and increase \u03b3-oscillations. Conversely, they identified that positive modulators decrease oscillations. Using EEGs on hippocampal slices, lead drug candidates have been identified to increase \u03b3-oscillations by engaging GABAARs. These novel brain permeable NAMs will have profound change in the underlying cognitive impairments found in various neurological and psychiatric disorders.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022    Treatment to improve cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s, Schizophrenia, epilepsy, and others\u2022    Improve on brain stimulation-based treatmentsADVANTAGES:\u2022    Modulates native brain oscillations\u2022    Improved bioavailability of treatment to the all regions of the brain\u2022    Increased specificity to only neurons that modulate \u03b3-oscillationsDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:Proof of concept in laboratory settings has been established.

Lung cancer has a poor prognosis because most lung carcinomas are diagnosed at an advanced or metastatic stage. Thus, techniques to identify lung cancers at an earlier and potentially curable stage are urgently needed. In addition, 80-90% of lung cancer cases can be attributed to smoking, which damages patients\u2019 cardiovascular system and makes surgical or aggressive multimodality therapies unfeasible. Novel therapeutic targets and strategies to noninvasively prevent lung cancer metastasis could therefore revolutionize lung cancer treatment in the clinic.INNOVATION:Researchers at UCLA led by Dr. Claudio Scafoglio have discovered that a specific sodium-dependent glucose transporter, SGLT2, is expressed in the lungs pre-malignancy and in early stage cancers. Through this discovery, a novel approach using a glucose analog probe to image SGLT2 via positron emission tomography (PET) has been shown to successfully detect early lung cancer development in murine models. Additionally, the researchers have demonstrated that specific inhibitors of SGLT2 prevent further growth of pre-malignant and early-stage lung tumors, aiding in cancer interception.

However, these tissues have been out of reach by classic endovascular techniques for drug delivery, as their vascular supply is too small to image, access, and isolate.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:UCLA researchers in the department of Electrical Engineering have developed a method for recording of terahertz waveforms which can be used for both sensing and communication in the terahertz spectrum.BACKGROUND:Terahertz waves are part of the electromagnetic spectrum between infrared and microwaves. In optical sensing, infrared waves can induce stretching of bonds and microwaves can induce rotation of bonds. Terahertz waves have the ideal energy to induce torsions and collective vibrations within molecules. For example, large scale molecular structures act as a fingerprint that can be induced and read with these waves. This can be used in analytical chemistry devices but also in surveillance where terahertz waves can be used to detect concealed compounds. They can also be used for wireless communication by expanding the usable wavelengths and improving the communication bandwidth. Terahertz waves, however, are notoriously difficult to measure. While there has been success with measuring repetitive Terahertz waves, the ability to measure a single snapshot of a terahertz signal has proven to be even more difficult. Therefore, there is a need to be vast improvement in the ability to detect and measure terahertz waveforms from single snapshot measurements especially in the case of non-repetitive signals.INNOVATION:Researchers at UCLA have developed a method for detecting and recording the waveforms of individual Terahertz signals and does not rely on repetitive signals.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the department of Electrical Engineering have developed a deep learning approach that is capable of performing image reconstruction from raw holograms, which proves to be faster and superior at reconstruction as well as generalizable to new data.Background:Holographic imaging provides significant advantages over standard phase contrast microscopy. In conventional microscopy, the sample is projected onto a sensor. The distance of the sample and the multiple optical parts determine which part of the sample is in focus at any time. This has significant drawbacks. The optics required are inherently complex and expensive, and only the information from a single two-dimensional region is captured at any time. In addition, standard microscopy often utilizes inaccurate autofocus to ensure that the area imaged is exactly what is desired.In contrast, holographic imaging acquires the hologram of the entire thickness of the sample at once. This means that all the information for all focal distances are present in the data, removing the need for complex optics or expensive autofocus systems. Users also acquire all the three-dimensional information at once which is limited in speed only by the camera\u2019s frame rate rather than the thickness of the sample and speed of conventional autofocus systems. While the image generated from standard microscopy is human-interpretable right away, the data collected from a hologram is not as clear. Fortunately, all of the information exists within the data and algorithms can be created to generate interpretable images from holograms. These algorithms should be capable of performing digital autofocus across the sample as well as correcting optical aberration and reconstruct the image, preserving the three-dimensional information in the case of tomography. While there are some statistical approaches for holographic image reconstruction, the majority of the success has been in deep learning approaches. Consistent of most machine learning approaches, these algorithms are typically only capable of reconstructing samples that they were trained on, leading to the inability to generalize to new data. There is a clear and pressing need to improve these algorithms in speed, accuracy, and generalizability to new samples before holographic imaging can truly begin to be useful in replacing conventional phase contrast microscopy.Innovation:Researchers at UCLA have developed a deep learning-based Fourier transform-assisted holographic image reconstruction algorithm that is far superior than other existing options. In terms of speed the algorithm is capable of reconstructing images of 1 mm2 in ~0.04 s which is near the frame rate of the camera. Reconstructed images using this algorithm prove to be accurate when compared to phase contrast microscopy images collected on the same samples. The algorithm also has shown to be generalizable to vastly different sample types which were not used for initial training.Potential Applications:\u2022    Computational Microscopy\u2022    Inspection of materials\u2022    Detection of Counterfeiting\u2022    Image Reconstruction\u2022    Holographic Imaging\u2022    Holographic Tomography\u2022    Fluorescence and brightfield compatibleAdvantages:\u2022    >10X Faster (approximately same speed as sample collection)\u2022    Ability to parallelize to increase speed\u2022    Accurate compared to phase contrast images\u2022    Generalizable to other sample typesDevelopment-To-Date:Fourier Imager Network (FIN) has been successfully demonstrated on a variety of sample types that were not part of the initial training.",

BMIs have remained in pilot clinical trials for years due to the lack of technology that enables larger communities to design and optimize BMIs. Current technologies to study BMIs require expensive equipment and lengthy experiments, which reduces the pace of BMI research and limits accessibility to only a specific set of laboratories. Therefore, there is a need for tools that accelerate BMI development.Innovation:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a method that utilizes deep learning to create a BMI simulator. This method uses human-like artificial intelligence to efficiently interact with decoders in a simulated BMI environment, replacing the need for a human or macaque test subject. It enables rapid and efficient optimization of BMI decoders, a process which traditionally leads to the high cost and lengthy experimental times associated with BMI research. The method incorporates timely advances in systems neuroscience and deep learning to solve fundamental challenges in BMI simulation.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:UCLA researchers in the Department of Neurology have developed a novel small-molecule protease inhibitor cocktail to robustly suppress COVID-19 infection.INTRODUCTION:COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Despite the development of vaccines, COVID-19 was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2021, highlighting the continued need for more and varied interventions against the disease, especially for immunocompromised individuals. The urgency for further development of effective interventions is further stressed by the anticipated rise of more variants. One strategy being explored in the development of antiviral medications to mitigate severe COVID-19 infections is targeting of the virus\u2019s two cysteine proteases, the main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro), that mediate host immune response evasion and viral replication. These proteases are promising drug targets since they are dissimilar to human proteases and crucial to infection. Most research has so far focused on developing inhibitors for Mpro, and clinical data has shown that they successfully reduce hospitalization from COVID-19. Clinical effectiveness of protease inhibitor cocktails for treatment against HIV and Hepatitis C support the potential of using protease drug combinations for effective healthcare management and treatment of COVID-19. Thus, there is great potential that PLpro-targeting drugs, in combination with Mpro protease inhibitors, could further improve suppression of COVID-19 infections and reduce mortality. This approach would also decrease the likelihood of emergence of viral drug resistant mutants as it would be much harder for the virus to out-mutate two inhibitors at the same time.INNOVATIONUCLA researchers led by Professor Varghese John, Director of the Drug Discovery Lab in the Department of Neurology, in collaboration with Professor Robert Damoiseaux in the Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology and  Director of the Molecular Screening Platform at the Californina NanoSystems Institute, along with Professor Melody Li a UCLA virologist, have identified a FDA approved drug that functions as a PLpro protease inhibitor and could be used to treat COVID-19.  The research team employed high-throughput screening using a clinical compound library to identify molecules that inhibit PLpro. The drug is known to inhibit viral replication in Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, the researchers tested the drug\u2019s dose-response against inhibition of PLpro, its deubiquitinase and interferon-stimulated gene product activity. They found that the IC50 of the compound for PLpro inhibition is lower than its steady state plasma levels achieved clinically, after administration of a typically used dosage. This indicates that the current FDA approved dosage of the drug would inhibit the PLpro enzyme in patients and should produce robust suppression of COVID-19 infection. The researchers also demonstrated that the drug can work as a PLpro inhibitor in combination with the Mpro inhibitor nirmatrelvir and paxlovid.  Thus the drug when administered in combination with existing, clinically used Mpro inhibitors should show robust antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, repurposing of this already FDA-approved drug in protease cocktails could be used to treat severe COVID-19 cases and reduce hospitalization and deaths resulting from the disease, and speed up post-infection recovery. This drug combination is also likely to more resistant to emergence of single agent resistant viral mutants.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:Antiviral medication used by itself or in combination as a protease cocktail for more effective COVID-19 treatment, particularly for patients with high risk factorsADVANTAGES:Drug is already available as an oral tablet for easy administration.FDA-approved dosages of the drug achieve plasma levels that are above its IC50 for inhibiting PLpro, so clinical approval can be expeditedFewer anticipated COVID-19 long term side effects  due to the uniqueness of PLpro to SARS-CoV-2Resistance to the development of single agent resistant viral mutantsDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:The researchers have established that the candidate drug effectively inhibits PLpro enzyme, by itself and in combination with MPro inhibitors and clinically the protease cocktail could be highly effective against SARS-CoV-2.Based on their findings, the researchers have designed novel drug candidates with greater binding affinity to the active site domain of PLpro, and are working on synthesizing these compounds.RELEVANT PUBLICATIONS:Identification of a Papain-Like Protease Inhibitor with Potential for Repurposing in Combination with an Mpro Protease Inhibitor for Treatment of SARS-CoV-2Jesus Campagna, Barbara Jagodzinska, Pablo Alvarez, Constance Yeun, Patricia Spilman, Kathryn M.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Mathematics have developed a technology to improve Artificial Intelligence pattern recognition for image segmentation, bio-chemical reactions and security applications.Background:Recently, there has been an increase in the quantity and complexity of generated data. Businesses that deal with large or complex datasets often struggle to interpret that data in meaningful ways. One new approach is to use graph theory to process the data. The idea behind graph theory is that each object in the data can be represented as a node. Each node can be connected to other nodes and the strength of their connection can be weighted to represent the connection of multiple objects within the complex dataset. Together this creates a graph that can be visualized and inspected for patterns. These patterns can be represented multiple times within the data. The attempt to find these patterns is known as subgraph matching.While the human mind is good at pattern recognition, we cannot scale this ability to process massive graphs of complex data. While there are computational approaches for finding subgraphs, they are computationally expensive, inaccurate and miss patterns. Some machine learning approaches have been proposed although they require a large, annotated dataset for training. Active learning is an approach in which a human will generate a smaller training dataset. The system will then train a machine learning model and attempt to process unlabeled data. The human will then curate the attempt and correct the incorrect attempts. Together the human and the machine can generate a large amount of training data and train an accurate machine learning model in a shorter amount of time than it would take for a human to manually generate all of the training data. These active learning strategies have yet to be incorporated into the subgraph matching problem despite the clear and pressing need.Innovation:Researchers at UCLA have developed a system that combines active learning with machine learning to efficiently solve the subgraph matching problem. This system used machine learning to determine nodes that will most likely reduce the solution space and allow humans to supply additional information about these nodes to sort through large data more efficiently. This reduces the need for large, annotated training sets that are conventionally used in machine learning algorithms. It also will allow for more accurate analysis of the vast complex data that exists and continues to grow. This system can be applied in a variety of solutions generating large datasets, including image segmentation processes, bio-chemical reactions, and security applications.Publication:Yurun Ge, Dominic Yang, Andrea L.

In 2020, about 80 million patients suffered from glaucoma, and over 110 million are projected to have the disease by 2040. To ensure proper treatment of the disease, diagnosis and progression monitoring are critical, and can be accomplished via several modalities. Retina Tomography (HRT) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) are viable methods, but they are new and often prohibitively expensive for clinics in lower socioeconomic regions. Fundoscopic photos of the optical disc and cup, on the other hand, are commonly used and are widely accessible. These photos are graded to determine the severity and progression of the glaucoma using the Disk Damage Likelihood Scale (DDLS). However, DDLS is implemented by clinicians, and the degree of diagnosis can therefore vary greatly from doctor-to-doctor. Therefore, there is a need for a standard method to perform DDLS scoring for the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma.INNOVATION: UCLA researchers in the Department of Ophthalmology have developed a standardized method to execute the Disk Damage Likelihood Scale (DDLS) using a deep learning-based system.

Typically, colorimetric and fluorescent readouts can be obtained in cells that adhere to the bottom of these wells to study biological functions. However, to sort single cells and perform functional biological assays, microwell plates are not optimal as the signal from individual cells is diluted by the large volume of fluid in the well.

Xerostomia ranges in severity from mild discomfort during chewing, swallowing, and speaking, to causing a variety of oral health problems including tooth decay and gum disease. Even for those with mild symptoms, dry mouth can compromise an individual\u2019s dietary intake and overall quality of life. The American Dental Association (ADA) estimates that xerostomia affects nearly 80 million people. In particular, elderly individuals aged 65 years or older and women experience xerostomia at a higher rate. The most common cause of dry mouth is medication, with over 1500 known drugs associated with the condition. The risk of suffering from xerostomia increases even more for patients taking three or more medications daily. Additional causes include radiation therapy to the head and neck, as well as systemic diseases such as Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. Although a bevy of treatments are available to remedy dry mouth, most cases go unreported because of the lack of a method for diagnosis. Thus, developing methods of detection for xerostomia could have huge implications benefiting the public and oral health of the general population.INNOVATION:Researchers at UCLA led by Dr. David Wong in the Department of Dentistry have developed a novel method for diagnosing xerostomia in patients. To do this, they used molecular profiling of saliva and parotid glands of 20 non-Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s, non-radiation induced dry mouth patients and 20 normal patients using RNA microarrays and DNA methylation analyses. From these subjects, they identified salivary biomarkers that indicate dry mouth for clinical evaluation. The researchers then utilized a systems network approach to identify key biological pathways and molecular targets associated with dry mouth. To aid in clinical settings, the researchers also developed a non-invasive biofluid for early detection of dry mouth. Their identification of biomarkers and the key biological pathways and molecular targets implicated in xerostomia could allow for further development of therapeutic interventions.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022    Diagnosis of xerostomia and monitoring of treatment progress\u2022    Aiding assessment of new xerostomia treatments in clinical trialsADVANTAGES:\u2022    Novel and comprehensive list of xerostomia biomarkers\u2022    Method of detection is noninvasive\u2022    Elucidated biological pathways and molecular targets that are unique to xerostomia could allow for further development of therapeutic interventionsDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:UCLA researchers developed a novel method of detection for xerostomia using saliva and parotid glands tissue samples from 20 dry mouth and 20 non-dry mouth subjects.",

    "ip_description": "INTRODUCTIONUCLA researchers in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, & Molecular Genetics have found that the knockout of four host cell antiviral factors could increase lentiviral titers, allowing the potential to reduce common off target toxicities of gene therapy while lowering the cost of treatment manufacturing.BACKGROUNDGene therapy holds the promise of providing lasting therapies or cures for diseases thought to be previously untreatable. In gene therapy, identified defective genes are corrected though viral vector-mediated gene addition or gene editing. A commonly utilized pathway for gene therapy is through the use of lentiviral vectors with autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The HSCs are harvested from patients, then grown in culture with a lentiviral vector to transduce and produce gene-modified HSCs that can be reinfused to the patient to produce a therapeutic response. This pathway is often begun with cell culture lines like HEK293T cells as vector packaging cells, to both reduce manufacturing costs and increase transfection efficiency. While mounting clinical success has been found for several diseases through this pathway, the use of complex vectors for inserting larger genes (such as beta-globin) leads to reductions in the amounts of vector made (known as titer). As a consequence, poor titer leads to ineffective gene transfer to HSCs and he high amounts of vector needed per patient dose are often restrictive in manufacturing cost: stagnating the production of a wide catalogue of gene therapies. Therefore, a current unmet need exists to identify a universal methodology that could increase the titer of lentivirus constructs for the purpose of extending gene therapy to more diseases.INNOVATIONDr. Kohn and colleagues in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, & Molecular Genetics at UCLA have identified four host cell antiviral factors, in the virus production cell line, HEK293T cells. These factors regulate the DNA damage response pathway, transcription, and innate immunity in the host cell. As a model system, the researchers used a lentiviral vector for sickle cell disease and knocked out the four cell host factors for transfected HEK293T cells using CRISPR/Cas9. It was observed that the titer for the lentiviral vector increased 2-4 fold. Importantly, the knockout methodology could be applied with any lentiviral construct, allowing the ability to effectively increase titer. The proposed methodology could therefore allow the ability to increase gene therapy efforts to several diseases, thought to be untreatable with gene therapy.APPLICATIONSGene TherapyGenetic Diseases such as Sickle Cell DiseaseCancer ImmunotherapyADVANTAGESDecrease the cost of lentivirus productionIncrease the successful rate of gene editingAbility to package larger transgenes by the lentiviral vectorSTATE OF DEVELOPMENTThe study has shown by knocking out antiviral factors in HEK293T cell line, the titer of B-globin lentivirus for the treatment of sickle cell disease increases 2-4-fold.Related Papers: Improved lentiviral vector titers from a multi-gene knockout packaging line.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the Department of Biomolecular and Chemical Engineering have developed a novel anode material that has improved capacity and stability of sodium-ion batteries.Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have revolutionized technology in multiple fields and can be found in a wide array of technologies, ranging from electric cars to smartphones. While LIBs have high energy density and can withstand thousands of recharging cycles, they are often too expensive due to the lithium\u2019s scarcity. Since the global market for LIBs is poised to grow from $41.1B in 2021 to $116.6B by 2030, there is a high demand for a cost-effective alternative that uses widely available materials. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising option due to the relative abundance of sodium, but SIBs have not yet been widely adopted. Anode materials commonly used in SIBs often limit the cycling stability, capacity, and efficiency of the resulting SIB. To ensure they are a viable alternative to LIBs, advanced anode materials must be developed to improve the performance of SIBs.UCLA researchers led by Professor Yunfeng Lu have developed a new anode material for SIBs that has excellent cycling stability and energy capacity. The anodes not only lead to 14% greater capacity than competing materials, but they also retained greater than 90% of their reversible capacity after 500 cycles. The material is also mechanically robust due to its composite nature.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARY: UCLA researchers in the Department of Bioengineering have developed a small wireless electrical stimulus device to treat refractory gastroparesis and monitor the stimulus delivery during treatment that is lead free and minimally invasive.BACKGROUND: Refractory gastroparesis is a medical disorder that weakens the muscular contractions of the stomach and leads to retention of foods and liquids in the stomach for a prolonged period of time. Current treatments require dietary modifications, medications, and surgical approaches. Unfortunately, it is challenging for patients to follow a strict diet and medications can have serious side effects. Surgical procedures for gastroparesis require a feeding tube which is very uncomfortable. In recent years, the use of electrical stimulation (ES) has been investigated as a therapeutic remedy for refractory gastroparesis. However, current ES devices are lead-based and their implementation may lead to unwanted surgical complications. Further studies are needed to understand the physiological mechanism by electrical stimulation. Therefore, there is a need for a small ES device that can facilitate surgical procedures and monitor the treatment without life-threatening complications caused by the lead-based surgical devices.INNOVATION: UCLA researchers in the Department of Bioengineering have developed a leadless electrical stimulus device for the treatment of refractory gastroparesis. The device is designed as a minimally invasive miniature wireless gastric pacemaker to reduce lead-based complications. The architecture of the device allows for long-range wireless power transfer and a vascular fixation mechanism to reduce surgical complications and infections. Furthermore, the device has a multi-electrode electrogastogram (EGG) that monitors electrical stimulus and motor activity for adequate gastric pacing. This device provides a non-invasive and lead-free alternative for gastroparesis treatment and monitoring that de-risks surgical procedures and ultimately improves patient outcome.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS: Refractory gastroparesis treatmentTreatment monitoringDiagnostics of gastroparesisPhysiological motor activityObesity treatmentADVANTAGES: Lead freeWirelessSmall sizeMinimally invasiveLow variabilityMonitor and analyze stimulus deliveryDEVELOPMENT TO DATE: First successful demonstration by in vivo gastric pacing on swine gut.RELATED PAPERS: Perley A, Roustaei M, Aguilar-Rivera M, Kunkel DC, Hsiai TK, Coleman TP, Abiri P.

Typically, solid-state battery packs are used, but many of them are bulky and require charging from external sources to provide power on-demand. Humans generate around 100 watts of power a day via biomechanical motion. While it is possible to harvest energy from this motion, current technologies, such as piezoelectricity, do not have sufficient current density to be reliably integrated into wearable circuits. Furthermore, piezoelectric generators often require additional encapsulation to protect them from sweat and humidity thus limiting their practical implementation. Therefore, there is a need for an energy generator system that can efficiently harness the energy of biomechanical motion and operate in moist environments.Innovation: UCLA researchers have developed a wearable generator in the form of a membrane that conforms to human skin and efficiently harnesses energy from biomechanical motion. The device utilizes a soft magnetoelastic generator (MEG) and shows ultralow impedance and high current density. This results in a 10,000-fold improvement over conventional soft piezoelectric and triboelectric generators. It does not require encapsulation to protect against moisture and sweat because the device is intrinsically stable in wet environments.

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UCLA\u2019s Department of Neurosurgery and Pharmacology have developed a rapid discovery platform for the identification of tumor-specific T cell receptors to aid in more personalized and potent immunotherapy for glioblastoma.Over the past several years, immunotherapy, or therapies that enlist and strengthen the power of a patient\u2019s immune system to attack tumors with specificity, has emerged as a powerful tool in cancer treatment. To a large extent, the specificity and effectiveness of immunotherapy is dependent on the recognition of specific tumor antigens called neoantigens. For solid tumors, which represent approximately 90% of adult human cancers, a promising immunotherapy strategy is to identify tumor-reactive T cell receptors (TCRs) and to then engineer these receptors into cells capable of mediating a response once infused back into the patient (TCR-T). Most solid tumors have limited immunotherapy treatment options in large part because of the lack of known tumor-specific antigens to target cancer cells with, and the unique immunosuppressive environment associated with solid tumors. TCR-T overcomes these challenges by harnessing a bespoke population of polyclonal TCRs that are identified as reactive to a particular solid tumor. T cells that express these TCRs can be enhanced with phenotypes that encourage activity in spite of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Development of this strategy has great urgency particularly for the treatment of moderately immunogenic, heterogeneous, and aggressive cancer types, such as glioblastoma (GBM), that have a low patient survival rate \u2013 12 to 18 months for GBM, when treated with the current standards of care that include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, despite the promise of available immunotherapies, most clinical trials for patients diagnosed with GBM have produced disappointing results to date. Therefore, significant innovation is needed to advance TCR-T for glioblastoma and other heterogeneous cancers.UCLA researchers in the Department of Neurosurgery and Pharmacology have developed a rapid approach to identify tumor-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) for more personalized and powerful immunotherapy against glioblastoma. Their approach was two-phased; first, using a discovery platform they call Isoform peptides from RNA splicing for Immunotherapy target Screening (IRIS), they successfully identified a series of conserved alternative splice neoantigens from bulk RNA sequencing data; demonstrated on more than 40 glioblastoma and brain metastasis patients. They then synthesized 1000s of TCRs based on the IRIS results and isolated a library of neoantigen-reactive TCRs that recognized alternative splicing variations identified in the IRIS pipeline. Together, this novel approach for identifying tumor-specific T cell receptors could progress personalized TCR-T and off-the-shelf TCR-T targeting alternative splicing based neoantigens towards the clinic.Platform for the identification of tumor-specific T cell receptors, allowing for more potent and personalized immunotherapy against glioblastoma and other solid tumor cancer typesSynthesis of a library of T cell receptors from single cell sequencing data is fast (days) and affordableIdentified T cell receptors are tumor-specificT cell receptors can recognize a variety of tumor antigens across multiple human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typesResearchers have successfully used the IRIS pipeline and Jurkat reporter cells to identify and confirm neoantigens, and are continuing to collect data on neoantigen-reactive TCRs.",

However, many of these applications require more memory capacity and bandwidth than can be provided by a single processing node. To resolve this issue, multiple processing nodes can be connected using interconnection technologies. This results in bottlenecks that slow down the system and constrains the design space resulting in worse memory utilization and performance. Furthermore, the scaling of this architecture is impossible and makes the downstream interconnection of heterogeneous technologies (e.g., DRAM, SRAM, Flash, etc.) difficult to use. A significant need remains to develop an architecture that can interconnect multiple processing nodes without suffering from poor memory capacity and latency.Innovation:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a densely integrated, chiplet based networked memory pool with high intra-pool bandwidth. The chiplet architecture provides a common interface to the network, allowing the memory to be assembled in a variety of different configurations.

Pediatricians and other healthcare providers are increasingly concerned that these products (and the way that they are aggressively marketed) pose a tremendous danger to children\u2019s health. In 2020, 3.6 million adolescents and young adults reported regular use of e-cigarette and vaping devices, but the true effects of these new and emerging tobacco products (and all the chemicals they contain) are not known. Among high school users, almost 40% are using e-cigarettes more than 20 days a month, and more than 8 out of 10 report use of flavored products. E-cigarettes often contain ingredients such as propylene glycol and glycerol, mixed with concentrated flavors and, optionally, a variable percentage of nicotine. Some of the compounds found in the solution and aerosols generated by e-cigarettes are known to be toxic, carcinogenic, and/or to cause respiratory and cardiac diseases. There are more than 15,000 unique flavors on the market, and the chemical compositions are highly variable, yet current testing tools can only test one aerosol at a time. Therefore, there is an increasing need to develop new research tools that enable efficient, systematic, and combinatorial toxicology testing strategies for e-cigarette and vaping products that can help to guide regulatory efforts in support of public health initiatives focused on this critical area of children\u2019s health.INNOVATION:UCLA Researchers in the Departments of Bioengineering and Pediatrics have developed a new tool for testing e-cigarette aerosols more efficiently.

The light spectrum that these sensors detect is often heterogeneous, containing information about multiple sources. Though there are methods for separating these spectra, they come at the cost of sensitivity. This impairs signal analysis of distant stars as well as detection of trace amounts of molecules. While the overall size of traditional instruments can be increased to overcome this limitation, this comes at a steep physical cost, requires complex instrument calibration, and virtually eliminates the possibility of developing portable instruments. Portable optical sensors that are capable of high spectral resolution would have plentiful applications, including astronomy, forensic science, and industrial applications. Therefore, there is a need for highly sensitive portable optical sensors that can distinguish the optical spectrum produced from different sources.Innovation: Using a scalable plasmonic encoder, UCLA researchers have developed a high-resolution spectral analysis device coupled with a deep learning neural network.

One category of transformation is characterized by an altered metabolism that allows cancer cells to sustain higher proliferative rates and resist cell death signals, called metabolic reprogramming. Cancer therapy has long relied on targeting the aberrant metabolism observed in tumors, however, with limited degrees of efficacy. Many prospective metabolic drug targets in cancer are not active uniquely in cancer cells, making drugging them difficult without toxic side-effects. One pathway of great interest to the development of new cancer therapies, pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism, is an attractive target because of its specificity to cancer progression. Furthermore, rate-limiting enzymes in pyrimidine biosynthesis have been directly linked to mutant KRAS and MYC, two frequently mutated proteins in cancers. In particular, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme specific to the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, has been shown to be critical for melanoma progression. Development of therapies targeting DHODH could therefore have great potential value in treating cancer.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers in the Department of Molecular and Medicinal Pharmacology have identified that two clinically established PDK-1 inhibitors also inhibit DHODH. Of the protein kinase inhibitors evaluated in an in-house-designed differential metabolic modifier screen, OSU-03012 and TAK-632 scored the highest and second-highest, respectively, against the pyrimidine de novo pathway (DNP). Each had sub-micromolar IC50 values against a pancreatic cancer cell line starved of uridine and forced to rely upon DNP, indicating highly potent and selective inhibitory effects. The DHODH inhibitory action of these compounds was subsequently confirmed through use of a colorimetric assay using purified recombinant human DHODH, which demonstrated that both compounds inhibited the enzyme in a dose-dependent manner. Co-crystal structures of each compound complexed with human DHODH were also obtained, unambiguously confirming their DHODH-inhibitory ability. The intended targets of OSU-03012 (PDK-1) and TAK-632 (pan-RAF) are relevant for cancer therapy, as is the newly-identified target (DHODH). Additionally, DHODH is also a target for therapies against microbes in antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal settings. Taken together, OSU-03012 and TAK-632 hold great promise for treating a wide range of diseases and are thus uniquely positioned for further therapeutic evaluation.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u25cf    Novel therapeutic strategy in treating many types of cancer\u25cf    Antiviral agent against a host of diseases associated with DHODH, including Ebola, Zika, Influenza, and Epstein Barr\u25cf    Therapeutic intervention in antibacterial and antifungal settingsADVANTAGES:\u25cf    Compounds identified have multiple targets (PDK-1 for OSU-03012 and pan-RAF for TAK-632) associated with cancer cells, giving them greater potency as cancer therapies\u25cf    Low IC50 values indicate highly potent and selective inhibitory effects on the pyrimidine de novo pathway\u25cf    OSU-03012 has already received Orphan Drug Status in EuropeDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:Researchers have successfully demonstrated the efficacy of OSU-03012 and TAK-632 in inhibiting DHODH in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and confirmed the formation of protein-ligand complexes structurally using crystallography.Related Papers (from the inventors only):Abt ER, Rosser EW, Durst MA, et al.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:UCLA researchers in the Department of Medicine and Bioengineering have developed a novel microfluidic approach to study SARS-CoV-2 infection entry into blood cells of COVID-19 patients as a research tool to better understand the mechanisms that lead to blood clot formation.BACKGROUND:The World Health Organization estimates that there are over 244 million confirmed worldwide SARS-CoV-2 infection, or COVID-19, cases as of October 2021. SARS-CoV-2 initially infects respiratory epithelial cells, but accompanying this initial infection is the development of abnormal blood clots in some patients, which according to the NIH can be found even in the smallest blood vessels and throughout the body. Early studies on patients who had recovered from COVID-19 revealed abnormalities in the endothelial cells that line blood vessels. Furthermore, the damage caused by viral infection in these endothelial cells can result in elevated numbers of blood clots.  Blood clotting is a serious complication of COVID-19 infection as it can lead to organ damage, strokes and heart attacks when left untreated.Current methods to study the blood vessels damage in COVID-19 patients are limited to retrospective data, and the use of time-consuming and facility-specific animal model studies that make use of the live SARS-CoV2 virus. Microfluidic diagnostic chips have seen application in studies with blood, such as for blood typing and universal coagulation assays because they maintain the relevant physiological flow of the cells and allow for high-throughput studies to be performed. Unfortunately, there are no microfluidic based methods that enable studying SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell types implicated in clotting; lab-on-a-chip methods involving SARS-CoV-2 are currently limited to RNA detection methods. Advancing on these existing technologies could allow more high-throughput studies concerning the viral infection mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 into blood vessel endothelial cells. Novel and physiologically compatible microfluidic chips are needed to model SARS-CoV-2 infection to elucidate mechanisms that cause blood clot formation in patients.INNOVATION:Researchers at UCLA led by Dr. Tzung Hsiai have developed a safe and efficient method making use of a microfluidic chip that models SARS-CoV-2 entry. The method involves two components: SARS-CoV-2 mimicking liposomal nanoparticles, and a microfluid chip coated with human endothelial cells. The innovative method recapitulates interaction between human endothelial tissue that lines blood vessels and the viral S-spike protein or spike variants.  The S-spike protein then binds to the ACE2 cell surface receptors and is internalized by the endothelial cells. In this manner, the physiological nature of the virus entering the cells can be studied under relevant physiological flow. This technology is useful in modeling and understanding COVID-19 infection in blood vessels of patients that can lead to the formation of blood clots, and for potentially testing novel therapies that interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, the novel methodology does not require the stringent biosafety level associated with working with live SARS-CoV-2 virus and variants.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022    Advance the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in endothelial cells.\u2022    Understand SARS-CoV-2 related blood clot formation.\u2022    Test new modalities to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection.ADVANTAGES:\u2022    High throughput method of mimic the entry of SARS-CoV-2.\u2022    Potential cost-effective strategy to test novel COVID-19 therapies.\u2022    Patient-specific blood clot understanding.DEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:UCLA researchers have demonstrated an increase in blood clot formation after human endothelial cells were presented with the Spike protein.Related Papers (from the inventors only):Satta, S., Lai, A., Cavallero, S., Williamson, C., Chen, J., Bl\u00e1zquez-Medela, A.

It\u2019s estimated that 1 million people die every year due to water, sanitation or hygiene related problems, and every 2 minutes a child dies due to poor quality water.Water can contain hundreds of different microorganisms, making the analysis of all possible pathogenic microorganisms very challenging. However, the presence ofE. coliand total coliform in a water sample is widely accepted as evidence for contamination of a water supply. There are several EPA-approved methods used to monitor water quality which employ conventional microbiological techniques. However, these microbiological methods have some limitations, such as a long total analysis time, interference from non-coliform bacteria, limited detection of slow growing or stressed coliform, viable but non-culturable (VBNC) bacteria, and requiring transportation to central lab facilities with trained professionals. Water quality can also be monitored by optical, electrochemical, piezoelectric or plasmonic biosensors. However, such biosensor technologies typically lack sensitivity and/or are constrained to very small sample volumes, in addition to requiring complex and expensive benchtop equipment to operate.One of the EPA-approved methods forE. coliand total coliform detection is Colilert. This is one of the most widely used techniques and is used to simultaneously detectE. coliand total coliform in drinking water by changing the color of contaminated water to yellow. However, the Colilert process takes 24 to 28 hours, and is not an on-site method.There is a clear need for an on-site device that can operated without specialized personnel that is capable of detecting 1 CFU/100 mL in less than 24 hours.INNOVATION:Researchers at UCLA have developed a small, automated optical device that uses Colilert to rapidly detect bacterial contamination. The device performs periodic measurements of the absorption and fluorescence of water.  Images are digitally processed to detect the presence of bacteria in each well of a well plate.  Tests demonstrated that this 1.66-kg device can automatically detect the presence of both E. coli and total coliform within ~16 hours, down to a level of one colony-forming unit (CFU) per 100 mL, which allows the sample to be processed on site, using limited laboratory equipment and without specialized personnel.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:Water Contamination TestingOn-Site Colorimetric TestingADVANTAGES:On-SiteMinimal TrainingRapid DetectionLight WeightSensitiveDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:A prototype device has been developed and tested to show high sensitivity of detection of contaminated water samples within 16 hours.",

Routes of delivery, delivery vehicles, and therapeutic packaging differ between drug delivery systems, and may be individually curated to increase efficacy and proper drug targeting. However, conventional methods of pharmaceutical delivery via systemic administration exposes the whole body to a drug, which often causes undesirable, off-target side effects. Even once the drug reaches its desired tissue, the dosage may not be therapeutically maximal. There is significant interest in the development of novel drug delivery systems that target therapeutic molecules directly to diseased tissue, to increase the efficiency and safety of therapeutics.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers have created a DNA construct that is targeted in vivo to deliver a therapeutic, biological molecule specifically to sites of disease by immune cells.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:Researchers from UCLA\u2019s Departments of Human Genetics and Urology have developed a novel method to predict disease susceptibility and aggression of multiple hereditary cancer types in individuals which will inform more personalized and effective therapies.BACKGROUND:The American Cancer Society reports that approximately 40% of people will develop cancer in their lifetime. While environmental factors, such as diet and smoking, can be controlled to decrease risk, inherited genetic factors contribute strongly to an individual\u2019s propensity to develop cancer.  It is estimated that heritable factors account for up to a third of the risk associated with cancer diagnosis. While many of the mutations that convert normal genes to their oncogenic form have been characterized, exactly how the inherited germline genome can increase risk of developing these oncogenic transformations remains largely unknown. Current therapeutics treat cancer only after diagnosis, and with varying degrees of effectiveness, in part due to the vast genetic and molecular landscape even within specific cancer types. Information on patient-specific germline genetics could help to inform clinicians on the molecular signature of cancers before they even develop, opening the door to the development of therapies that reduce risk of cancer using precision medicine. Furthermore, a more in-depth understanding of the relationship between germline genetics and cancer could vastly aid in designing tumor-specific treatment plans rather than the ineffective one-size-fits-all approaches currently employed in the clinic. Elucidation of this relationship would help to predict the molecular features and risk of a cancer decades prior to diagnosis, allowing for more personalized and effective treatment of a deadly disease.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers in the Department of Human Genetics have identified 62 regions of association between germline polymorphisms and somatic mutational features in prostate cancer called driver quantitative trait loci (dQTLs). The research team led by Dr. Paul Boutros developed a method utilizing whole genome sequencing to predict the somatic mutational features and clinical outcomes across multiple cancer types based on germline polymorphisms. The researchers assembled a discovery cohort of more than 400 patients with localized prostate cancer, one of the most heritable cancers, each with whole-genome sequencing of blood and tumor, and subsequently replicated their findings in a cohort of over 1,000 tumors from multiple countries around the world. Using novel data science and machine-learning approaches they identified 62 dQTLs that modulate tumorigenesis by affecting the tumor epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome. Amongst those dQTLs, a subset predicts clinical outcomes, and some individual dQTLs affect multiple cancer types, significantly enhancing their actionability. Taken together, the researchers revealed intricate crosstalk between the germline and somatic genome of primary tumors that can underlie a powerful tool for cancer diagnostics and therapies.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u25cf    Machine-learning strategies to create sensitive biomarkers for drug-sensitivity and toxicity\u25cf    Predict cancer aggression and inform more personalized therapy\u25cf    Identify prognostic germline loci that might be minimally invasive biomarkers\u25cf    Aid the triage of patients to more expensive tissue- or radiology-based assays\u25cf    Improve understanding of ancestral differences in cancer genomic landscapesADVANTAGES:\u25cf    Accurately predicts whether a tumor will harbor a specific gene mutation, allowing for prediction of cancer susceptibility and aggression decades prior to diagnosis\u25cf    Hugely expands the utility of genomic testing with hundreds of dQTLs yet to be discoveredDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:Researchers have successfully developed a method that identified 62 dQTLs in a discovery cohort, from which a subset was accurately able to predict clinical outcomes in a replication cohort.Related Papers (from the inventors only):Houlahan, K.E.; et al.

Hemodynamic management is crucial for physicians administering anesthetics, as poor management can cause detrimental outcomes and post-operative injuries such as acute kidney injury (AKI). In the current state of the field, hemodynamic management fails to quickly adjust and accommodate to the personalized needs of patients during surgery.

This innovation can be used for in vivo human cardiac reprogramming to provide a novel approach for cardiac regeneration in the clinic and other fields of regenerative medicine.BACKGROUNDIschemic heart disease is a leading cause of global mortality, accounting for over 9 million deaths per year according to the World Health Organization. A variety of stem cell therapies have been explored including adult mesenchymal stem cells and cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells. However, preclinical and clinical trials have not resulted in any effective therapies due to extensive cell death after transplantation, lack of integration of transplanted cardiomyocytes, and detrimental ventricular remodeling.The advancement of cell reprogramming opens a new avenue to convert differentiated cells into induced pluripotent stem cells and other cells such as cardiomyocytes. This has a tremendous potential for regenerative medicine and disease modeling. Direct cardiac reprogramming can convert fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes in vitro and potentially translated in vivo by the local delivery of GMT encoding retroviruses to improve heart function and regeneration. Interestingly, it was observed that in vivo reprogramming cardiomyocytes were more efficient and mature than in vitro reprogramming, possible due to the local micro-environment. However, the underlying mechanisms are not clear, and the reprogramming efficiency needs further improvement for effective regenerative therapy.INNOVATIONDr. Song Li and his team at UCLA discovered that immune cells play important roles in preventing and boosting cardiac reprogramming. By recognizing critical cytokines that modulate cardiac reprogramming, the inventors discovered how to modulate immune polarization with steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and statin drugs to enhance cardiac reprogramming efficiency.APPLICATIONS1.Enhance Cardiac reprogramming efficiency2.Cardiac regeneration3.Novel approach for modulating regenerative medicineADVANTAGES1.Can be utilized in vivo2.Uses already characterized steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and statin drugs to enhance cardiac reprogramming efficiencyState of Development: The description of the present invention will be submitted for publication to Nature Biomedical Engineering.Related Papers (from the inventors only): Pending",

When the need arises to keep instruments steady, they often rely on mechanical armatures that articulate and lock in place. These armatures are very useful as they free up the hands of hospital staff allowing them focus on the operation, and due to their physical knob-actuated locks, the articulating arms are very steady. However, the armatures are often cumbersome to use. The locking system, while secure, is difficult and slow to engage because the knobs must be rotated with high force to be positioned or repositioned.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering have developed an innovative recurrent neural network algorithm that improves image quality and increases the speed of holographic image reconstruction.BACKGROUND:Tissue biopsies are a commonly used tool for disease diagnosis. Pathologists have been transitioning into more data-driven approaches for analyzing pathology samples. Digital holographic microscopy is a powerful tool to obtain three-dimensional and complex (phase and amplitude) transmittance properties about biological samples with minimal sample preparation and without expensive microscopes. This technology works by acquiring images of a sample at various focus heights and then computationally reconstructing the complex field of samples in three-dimensional space. However, conventionally complicated algorithms must be employed to reconstruct sample phase and amplitude information from intensity-only measurement by photoelectric sensors. The standard computational tools used tend to be iterative and slow in nature. There is a clear need for algorithms that are capable of quickly recovering high degrees of spatial resolution. While recent research has shown that deep-learning reconstruction algorithms outperform conventional iterative techniques, there is a need to further develop these algorithms to improve image quality and reduce processing time.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers have developed a new recurrent neural network-based (RNN) holographic reconstruction algorithm that can efficiently reconstruct the phase and amplitude of an imaged sample. The algorithm improves image quality reconstruction by 40% at a processing rate of 15-fold compared to other deep-learning based iterative reconstruction processes. In addition, the invention reduces the complexity of the reconstruction process by removing the need for free-space back-propagation (FSP) step in existing deep learning-based holographic reconstruction algorithms. The algorithm also allows for a greater depth of field due its integrated auto-focusing feature.

The standard method to test for infectious diseases involves deep nasal swabbing in combination with real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rt-PCR) for confirming positive test results.

However, there is a tradeoff between a material\u2019s high thermal conductivity and the soft mechanics that enable its enhanced thermal coupling. Strongly bonded materials, such as ceramics and dielectrics, usually have high thermal conductivity, but their rigid structure can potentially lead to delamination, cracking, and void formation.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARYResearchers in the School of Dentistry at UCLA have developed a new method to detect periodontitis at early onset.BACKGROUNDAdult periodontitis is a severe infection of the gums that presents with chronic gum inflammation, connective tissue degradation and irreversible bone loss, which can cause tooth loss. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey revealed periodontitis is present in 46% of US adults, and 8.9% of the people have developed severe or aggressive periodontitis. The progression of periodontitis is initiated by the collagen degradation of gingival and periodontal ligament, followed by the formation of periodontal pocket and alveolar bone resorption. During disease progression, osteoclasts, which are specialized cells that can induce bone resorption, are recruited to the site of infection and secrete large amounts of the extracellular matrix degrading protease cathepsin K (CatK). CatK is a well-established marker of enriched osteoclast activity, and individuals presenting with periodontitis are well characterized to possess elevated levels of CatK in surrounding fluid, even at early stages of the disease.  Current examination and diagnosis for periodontitis involve periodontal pocket depth charting and dental radiography, neither of which can detect the initial tissue degradation prior to the formation of periodontal pocket and alveolar bone resorption. Therefore, there is an unmet need for diagnostic tools for periodontitis at early stages.INNOVATIONResearchers in the School of Dentistry at UCLA and Department of Chemistry at USC  have developed a novel diagnostic probe to detect the early signs of periodontitis. A chemical compound called Osteoadsorptive Fluorogenic Substrate 3 (OFS-3) is used to detect CatK activity, an enzyme that degrades the bone collagen matrix. OFS-3 has been shown to detect CatK activity in the mouse periodontitis model as early as day 3 after induction in a site-specific manner. Notably, OFS-3 transmits consistent signal through overlining gum tissues, enabling easy detection of the probe without tissue removal. Therefore OFS-3 can significantly improve the early detection of periodontitis and contribute to early interventions.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONSDetection of early signs of periodontitis.Detection of other diseases including but not limited to hypocalcemia, hypoparathyroidism, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and certain cancers.ADVANTAGESCan detect early stages of periodontitis.Strong and consistent signals through overlining soft tissues.Novel fluorescent moiety has better penetrance and brightness than previously described CatK probes.DEVELOPMENT-TO-DATEThe method has been tested in animal models.RELATED PAPERSRichard, E.T.; Morinaga, K; Zheng, Y; Sundberg, O; Hokugo, A; Hui, K; Zhou, Y; Sasaki, H; Kashemirov, B.A.; Nishimura, I; McKenna, C.E., \u201cDesign and Synthesis of Cathepsin-K-Activated Osteoadsorptive Fluorogenic Sentinel (OFS) Probes for Detecting Early Osteoclastic Bone Resorption in a Multiple Myeloma Mouse Model,\u201d Bioconjug Chem. 2021, doi: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.1c00036.",

In addition, they found personalized mutations that generate peptides against which the immune system could be trained to more vigorously attack tumors.BACKGROUNDCheckpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 have recently yielded unprecedented and durable responses in a large percentage of cancer patients, leading to U.S. FDA approval of multiple checkpoint inhibitors for various cancer indications.Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B has been recognized as a major determinant of discrepancies in disease outcomes, and recent evidence suggests a role in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) efficacy. While HLA moieties have been implicated in immune responses to cancer for decades, there is a growing interest in the role of HLA supertypes, which leverage structural features to bind to HLA alleles. Identifying factors that can improve outcomes if ICB treatment is integral for the treatment of cancer patients.INNOVATIONEdward Garon, Amy Cummings, and Maura Rosetti at UCLA have identified similarities within mutational landscapes within HLA-B supertypes, specifically B44, of patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer that could improve assessments of HLA-related outcomes and predictions of immune checkpoint blockades in approximately half of the world\u2019s population. They found that peptides with radical negative amino acid substitutions, such as glutamic acid substitutions. in the anchor position had enhanced B44 binding, and that patients with B44 supertype whose tumors contained these substitutions exhibited improved ICB response. Findings were similar in patients with B27 supertype whose tumors contained radical positive amino acid substitutions. The inventors resolve the discrepancy in ICB survival based on HLA-B in non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma by considering the presence of favorable mutations that can be targeted by the adaptive immune system. Moreover, the B44 supertypes of interest exist in approximately half of patients. They also hope to train the immune system of patients with these favorable mutations to have even greater activity against tumors harboring these mutations.APPLICATIONS\u2022    Interventional Oncology\u2022    Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors\u2022    Non-small cell lung cancer treatment\u2022    HLA-B supertypes associated with ICB responseADVANTAGES\u2022    Can help identify outcomes of immune checkpoint blockades in half of the world\u2019s population\u2022    Identifies supertypes that had significant survival benefits after immune checkpoint therapy\u2022    Can inform a patient-specific immunotherapeutic approach to improve upon current therapyDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATEThe present invention has been evaluated in vitro and validated in patient tissue samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.RELATED PAPERSCummings, A.L., Gukasyan, J., Lu, H.Y. et al.

Typically, these processes release excess CH4into the atmosphere contributing to climate change. CH4functionalization is essential for multiple chemical processes and offers a solution for utilizing CH4to prevent its release into the atmosphere. Ambient methane (CH4) functionalization offers a route of chemical synthesis that mitigates the emission of CH4from the environment that comes from natural gas. The primary obstacle encountered when attempting CH4functionalization is the high C-H bond dissociation energy, leading to CH4stability at ambient conditions. The most common homogeneous catalysts contain metals such as gold, palladium, and mercury. Nevertheless, these metals require strong acids and may lead to the formation of undesirable products. Metals such as manganese and cobalt have been used to activate the C-H bond of CH4. However, these active metal catalysts require elevated temperatures (50 \u00b0C \u2013 220 \u00b0C).

    "ip_description": "Researchers at UCLA\u2019s David Geffen School of Medicine have designed three novel antibodies of the IgE class targeting antigens CD138, CD38, and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1/CD71): cancer antigens present in various hematopoietic and/or solid tumors. There are several advantages of IgE class antibodies compared to the commonly used IgG class in the clinic such as the high affinity of IgE for its Fc receptors, which results in more efficient arming of effector cells that would be able to penetrate the tumor without losing surface-bound antibodies, and the expression of these receptors on relevant effector cells such as mast cells, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, basophils, Langerhans cells, and dendritic cells. Additional advantages are the low serum levels of IgE that result in less competition with endogenous antibodies for Fc receptor occupancy and the fact that, in contrast to IgG, IgE does not have an inhibitory Fc receptor, which decreases the antibody effector functions.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nImmunoglobulins (Ig\u2019s), also known as antibodies, are glycoprotein molecules produced in plasma cells. Ig\u2019s are crucial to immune response, explicitly recognizing and binding to particular antigens present on bacteria, viruses, or cancer cells. Various classes of Ig\u2019s (e.g., IgG, IgA, IgE) differ in their structure and biological features. Due to the complex and exceedingly specific nature of Ig\u2019s for antigens, they have been used to target various cancer cells. The IgG class of Ig\u2019s has experienced the most significant development for cancer therapy but has only shown partial treatment efficacy in the clinic. More recently, the IgE class antibody has started to be considered for cancer therapy. In fact, the IgE antibodies targeting tumor antigens have already been developed and so far have shown efficacy and have been well-tolerated in preclinical models as well as in the clinic. There is a dire need to create new IgE constructs to target a more diverse population of tumor antigens. Importantly, antibodies of the IgE class can be used in combination with other drugs including IgG antibodies engaging different Fc receptors and/or effector cells and maximizing the anti-tumor activity. In fact, combination treatment of cancer with multiple drugs is part of the standard care.\n\nINNOVATION\n\nUCLA researchers have developed a series of new IgE antibodies for cancer therapy, explicitly targeting tumor antigens CD138 (syndecan-1), CD38, and TfR1 (CD71). These three targets are expressed in the incurable malignancy multiple myeloma (MM). However, each of these targets have distinct expression for other malignancies that could be targeted with this novel series of IgE antibodies. For instance, CD138 expression is present in non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), prostate cancer, breast cancer (including triple negative breast cancer), colorectal cancer, and kidney cancer. While CD38 expression is present in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), aggressive natural killer (NK) cell leukemia (ANKL), NK/T-cell lymphoma, and NHL. The overlap of target expression for a number of these diseases is seen with TfR1 \u2013 known as the universal cancer marker \u2013 sharing distinct expression for ALL, NHL, and CLL. The developed antibodies thus propose a multifaceted approach to targeting a wide array of malignancies.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS\n\n\u2022       Hematological cancers including: Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), aggressive natural killer (NK) cell leukemia (ANKL), NK/T-cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma (MM).\n\n\u2022       Epithelial cancers including lung, ovarian, prostate, breast (including triple negative), colorectal, and kidney cancers.\n\nADVANTAGES\n\n\u2022       IgE class antibodies have high affinity for target Fc receptors\n\n\u2022       Longer half-life on the surface of effector cells\n\n\u2022       Less competition for Fc receptor occupancy\n\n\u2022       Target antigens are present in a broad variety of tumors\n\n\u2022       It could be a generalizable standard care therapy (both monotherapy and combination therapy)\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE: These novel IgE antibodies have already been developed and exhibit their expected properties.",

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the Department of Bioengineering have developed a novel microneedle patch that effectively delivers nucleic acids across the skin for use as a delivery platform for gene therapies.\n\nBACKGROUND\nGene therapies work by delivering designed corrective nucleic acid sequences to cells expressing mutant disease-causing forms of genes. For gene therapy to fulfill its curative function, the therapeutic must be explicitly delivered to those cells targeted by the treatment. Strategies including the use of viral vectors have been exploited to target nucleic acids to required cell types. However, immunogenicity and biosafety are concerns associated with the use of targeting mechanisms of viral origin. Strategies using nonviral gene therapy vectors are promising for developing gene therapies in diverse tissue types.\n\nOne organ system, the skin, is a complex tissue arrangement containing extensive vasculature and networks of the lymphatic system that houses diverse cell types often targeted by gene therapies: including high numbers of immune cells. The tissue is also the site of numerous malignancies and disorders, including infections, cancers, wounds, and other genetic skin conditions with potential for treatment through gene therapy-based methods. Due to its proximity to the body's surface, the organ system is also a strong candidate for drug delivery systems using local application targeting. However, transdermal delivery remains challenging because of the tough protective skin layers. Delivery systems that can achieve transdermal delivery could enable next-generation gene therapies targeting pathologies in the previously untreatable skin because of low delivery efficiency across the dermal layers. Therefore, developing new safe and efficient strategies for transdermal nucleic acid delivery fulfills a significant need in gene therapy research.\n\nINNOVATION\nUCLA researchers in the Department of Bioengineering have developed a micro-needle-based patch that enables the delivery of nucleic acids across the dermal layer for use as a gene therapy carrier. The biodegradable patch is designed to be administered at the site of diverse skin pathologies to physically deliver therapeutic nucleic acids to the site of need. The platform makes use of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) composed of microneedles containing embedded DNA-encapsulated poly(B-amino ester) (PBAE) nanoparticles for controlled, local, transdermal delivery of plasmid DNA. Notably, the invention invokes high local transfection efficiencies both in vivo and in vitro.

The use of biosensors has revolutionized a number of industries including the medical industry. While early biosensors detected only physical movement newer iterations are capable of detecting molecules including biomarkers of disease severity. Some biosensors function as a wearable device that can be applied non-invasively while others are implanted within the body. Despite the location of the biosensor, biocompatibility is a common issue: pertaining to material. Advances to address biocompatibility have led to biosensors that are often inflexible, which can increase irritation to the site of attachment. New biosensors that offer \u201csoft\u201d materials, can still suffer from irritation at the site of attachment. Additionally, the material used in many of the modern biosensors are elastomers who either never break down or release materials that the body cannot process. It is therefore imperative that the next generation of biosensors need to be mechanically biocompatible with human biology as well as biodegradable to reduce the toxicity issues that current biosensors have.\n\nINNOVATION\nUCLA researchers in the department of Bioengineering have developed a novel, soft hydrogel that is biodegradable and capable of functioning in biosensors. The material when used to construct a wearable biosensor will have enough mechanical rigidity to stay intact in the body but be soft enough that irritation at the site of attachment is not an issue.

Many current approaches utilize synthetic fertilizers to improve agricultural productivity. However, these approaches often have serious environmental consequences including air/water pollution and loss of soil fertility, which will only worsen the food crisis in the long term. As a potential alternative, plant-growth promoting bacteria (PGPB), represent a more sustainable and environmentally friendly solution. Plants have a complex relationship with microorganisms, known as the phytomicrobiome. Bacteria plays an important role in the phytomicrobiome, with beneficial bacteria allowing plant growth in the most inhospitable environments. Unfortunately, while research in this area has significantly increased in recent years, the role of PGPB in food production remains limited. Therefore, there is an important unmet need to identify PGPBs to plant sources that can allow plants to grow more favorably in harsh conditions.\n\nINNOVATION\nResearchers in UCLA\u2019s Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology and Botswana University of Agriculture and Natural Resources have jointly isolated a number of PGPBs from root nodules of legumes grown in Botswana soils that may be useful in agriculture, silviculture, horticulture, and environmental cleanup applications.

    "ip_description": "Researchers from UCLA\u2019s Department of Radiation Oncology have developed a novel process for creating patient-specific immobilization masks: an essential component in radiation therapy modalities for various types of cancer.\n\nBACKGROUND\nExternal beam radiotherapy is the primary, and in some cases, the only form of treatment for various cancer types of the head, neck, and brain: due to their proximity to vital organs. During external beam radiotherapy, it is fundamentally essential to immobilize patients properly. Immobilization is traditionally achieved by using custom-made \u201cmasks\u201d to ensure precise and accurate delivery of the radiation beam while preventing radiation leakage to adjacent healthy tissues. Currently, these masks are made of commercial-grade thermoplastic polymer mesh and hard plastic, created using a manual imprinting method that utilizes the patient and intended treatment position as a mold. To avoid treatment bottlenecks, clinical workers must anticipate changes to patient treatment positions that would require the fabrication of a new mask. Further complicating this issue lies that unstandardized mask fabrication procedures can lead to significant differences in mask quality. Therefore, a current need exists to develop a standardized mask fabrication approach that can reduce clinical workload and solve quality control issues.\n\nINNOVATION\nUCLA researchers have developed a new approach for the creation of 3-D printed masks for immobilization during radiotherapy that dramatically improves on current methods by increasing safety, comfort, the accuracy of treatment, and reducing clinical work hours. They have achieved this by establishing a workflow that takes the diagnostic MR or CT images already generated during the diagnosis and management steps and repurposes this data to create a high accuracy 3-D topographical image of the patient\u2019s head. This image is then processed and serves as the schematics for a 3-D printed mask. The nature of this novel approach means that the patient does not need to be present during the mask creation process. Additionally, the mask can be better optimized for patient position and optimal dose calculation. The same image used to plan these parameters can be used to design the mask. The mask, in turn, can be created with added grooves and vents to improve patient comfort. Compared to current immobilization methods, this approach increases the safety profile of radiotherapy procedures while simultaneously enhancing patient comfort while reducing the clinic's burden.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\u2022       Immobilization of patients\n\u2022       External beam radiotherapy to the head and neck\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\u2022       Creates a more accurate mask\n\u2022       Better immobilization of the patient\n\u2022       Improved safety\n\u2022       Improved comfort\n\u2022       Reduces time input by utilizing already available MR/CT information\n\u2022       Reduce burden on clinical staff and patient\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE: Workflow to create masks has been established and prototype masks have been made for use in the clinic.",

While effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have now been developed, therapeutics to treat disease onset are only somewhat efficacious, and can require regiments to begin early in the disease onset. While vaccination rates continue to climb in the United States and other developed countries, developing countries continue to lag in their vaccination efforts: driving forward viral variants. Breakthrough infections, where the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects vaccinated individuals, are becoming increasingly common with the prevalence of new strains of the virus appearing. Unfortunately, the drug Remdesivir has relatively low effectiveness at treating SARS-CoV-2 infections and is extremely expensive for patients who typically only use it as a last resort. As a result of this poor current standard of care, it is paramount that next-generation therapeutics for COVID-19 are available both to unvaccinated individuals and those affected with breakthrough infections of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nINNOVATION\nUCLA researchers in the Department of Biological Chemistry have implicated a novel druggable target in SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially allowing for the development of therapeutic inhibitor molecules to treat COVID-19. Cell culture studies mimicking the environment and cell types found in the human lungs have identified that a protein responsible for modulating cellular metabolism (mTORC1) is upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the research group identified increased mTORC1 activity after infection in cell cultures expanded from stem cells taken from patients with healthy lungs and those with lung fibrosis. Importantly, clinically-used inhibitors of mTORC1 were found to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in cultured lung cells.  This discovery has revealed a novel biomarker identified during SARS-CoV-2 infection and could allow novel treatments of COVID-19.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\u2022       Treatment of COVID-19 infections\n\u2022       Advance understanding of the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\u2022       Potential to be a cost-effective targeting strategy.\n\u2022       Novel drug target adds to the relatively small repertoire of druggable molecules to treat COVID-19\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE: UCLA Researchers have demonstrated increased activity of mTORC1 in cells replicating healthy and fibrotic lung tissue after a challenge with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nRELATED PAPERS:\nMullen, P.

    "ip_description": "Summary: UCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a novel device to rapidly startup High-Q Oscillators which reduce power consumption of wearable electronic  devices.BackgroundWearable digital devices and small wirelessly connected devices known as \u201cInternet of Things\u201d are used in a wide range of applications from healthcare monitors to vending machines. Many of these devices rely on the use of small batteries which limits their battery life. In order to expand their battery life and reduce maintenance, these devices use a technique known as duty cycling. This technique conserves power by quickly powering up and down circuits as needed, decreasing unnecessary power consumption. Duty cycle is primarily done by pre-energizing crystals or micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) with another \u201cinjection\u201d oscillator at similar frequencies. When done properly, this can dramatically increase battery life. But due to variable environmental factors such as voltage, temperature, and fabrication errors generate mismatches between the frequencies of the injection oscillator and the crystal resulting in inefficient duty cycling. Attempts to address these mismatches such as using broad range injection oscillators or trimming the frequency error with factory calibrations, have failed to decrease startup time or only improve them under a restricting set of conditions limiting operational conditions that can be used. There is a need for an innovation that can address these mismatch errors and can expand the range of usable conditions.InnovationUCLA researchers have developed a device that rapidly calibrates injection oscillators upon startup. This allows fast startup of crystal oscillators in the range of microseconds without the performance loss. With this innovation, the frequency is able to match the resonant frequency to within sub-1000 ppm and can bypass mismatches associated with environmental and device variations. This drastically reduce the startup time resulting in an estimated decrease of 50% in the required startup energy. Furthermore, because of the calibration is included in the device, removes the need for factory calibration to be conducted reducing the need for frequent maintenance.Patent:Fast startup of crystal and other high-Q oscillatorsPotential ApplicationsReducing power consumption of digital devicesDigital devices including Internet of ThingsAdvantagesLower power consumption of digital devicesDigital devices that are more robust to environment and power fluctuationsRequires less maintenanceState of DevelopmentThe device has been conceptualized, designed, and simulated.

    "ip_number": "2019-611",

    "ip_description": "SUMMARYMonoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) is postulated to play a critical role in regulating tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization and TAM-induced/dependent immune response. Inhibition of MAO-A serves as a novel therapeutic target to prevent TAM polarization and -induce a robust antitumor immune response.BACKGROUNDTAMs are prominent metastasis promoters within the tumor microenvironment (TME). They do so by modulating tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis, immune regulation, metastasis, and chemoresistance. TAMs can be divided into M1 (classical-activated macrophages) and M2 (alternative-activated macrophages) phenotype: M1 macrophage play an important role in the innate responses in pathogen invading and anti-tumor activity, while M2 macrophage are anti-inflammatory and can promote tumor growth.Within the TME, macrophages can be polarized toward an immune-stimulatory phenotype by pro- inflammatory factors (e.g., Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3)) or toward an immune-suppressive phenotype by anti- inflammatory factors (e.g., Interleukin 4 (IL\u20134) and Interleukin (IL\u201313)). As a tumor develops and progresses, the secretion of IL\u20134 and IL\u201313 produced by tumor cells and CD4+ T cells within the TME results in the polarization of TAMs i.e., M1     M2, an immunosuppressive phenotype thereby, promoting tumor growth, malignancy, and metastasis. Thus, reprogramming TAMs is an attractive immunotherapy strategy.MAOA is an enzyme found within the outer mitochondrial membrane encoded by the X-linked MAOA gene. MOA-A is a key homeostatic regulator of monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine - pivotal for normal brain function. By the way of regulating neurotransmitters, MAOA modulates neuronal activities, behavior and moods. MAOA is implicated in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD). Several kinds of MAOA inhibitors are approved by the FDA for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role of MAO-A outside the brain especially, how MAO-A regulates macrophage activity and anti-tumor immune response remains elusive and vague.INNOVATIONDr. Lili Yang and colleagues in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics at UCLA have discovered that MAOA as a critical regulator of TAM within the TME. Genetic ablation of MAOA gene can inhibit TAM M2 polarization and can promote antitumor immunity. In addition, MAOA inhibitors were shown robust antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. By combining these inhibitors with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade result in synergistic tumor suppression efficacy, suggesting that MAOA inhibition can be a valuable treatment for single or combination cancer immunotherapies.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:Cancer immunotherapy (standalone or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-L1)Dual therapy benefits to cancer patients i.e., anti-depression and anti-tumor activity of MAOAIAADVANTAGES:Novel drug target with no serious side effectsSynergistic tumor suppression with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitorsMultiple MAOA inhibitors already approved by FDASTATE OF DEVELOPMENT:MAOA inhibitors have shown promising results in preclinical mouse tumor models. Combination of MAOA inhibitors with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors showed synergistic tumor suppression. Both results suggest MAOA is a potential drug target of cancer immunotherapy.Related Papers (from the inventors only)Wang, Xi, et al. \u201cTargeting Monoamine Oxidase A for T Cell\u2013Based Cancer Immunotherapy.\u201d Science Immunology, vol. 6, no. 59, 2021, p. eabh2383, doi:10.1126/sciimmunol.abh2383.Wang, Yu-Chen, et al. \u201cTargeting Monoamine Oxidase A-Regulated Tumor-Associated Macrophage Polarization for Cancer Immunotherapy.\u201d Nature Communications, vol. 12, no. 1, Springer US, 2021, pp. 1\u201317, doi:10.1038/s41467-021-23164-2.",

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends fabric masks for the general public. However, conventional masks with double fabric layers are incapable of completely eliminating/filtering the virus and merely serve as a physical barrier for the wearer. The viruses, bacteria, and other microorganisms that enter into masks are not immediately killed or deactivated and can pose a threat to the wearer and others once the mask is removed from the wearer. The risk of getting infected still exists even if people wear conventional masks, especially in places where many individuals congregate, such as hospitals, businesses, and public gathering spaces. Thus, there is a need for a functional mask capable of effectively protecting the wearer by killing bacteria and/or viruses on the spot.Innovation:UCLA inventors have developed a functional mask that is capable of eliminating a variety of microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria encountered by the wearer. This improvement upon conventional face masks effectively serves as a virucide to help reduce the risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2 that remains inside masks without having been eliminated.

Surprisingly, mortality associated with osteoporosis is almost 30%, a rate similar to breast cancer. It is therefore unsurprising that a range of drugs have been developed to treat the disease, one such notable class being anti-resorptive. However, a major pitfall of these therapies are off the target effects that in rare cases can contribute to new disease phenotypes. For instance, anti-resorptive medications can contribute to the onset of medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). This known off target effect causes a significant population of patients with osteoporosis to not be eligible for this effective treatment. Therefore, the invention of a treatment that could circumvent this known off target effect could possibly help a large portion of the population with the debilitating disease of osteoporosis.INNOVATIONDr. Tetradis at UCLA has developed a novel method for the treatment of drug induced osteonecrosis. The invention is based on the generation of osteoclast formation. Through this upregulation the resorption of drugs that treat osteoporosis is significantly inhibited. This method of treating the off target effects of anti-resorptive medications is novel, and the method represents a first in class method for its mitigation. Therefore, the presented invention stands to benefit a significant portion of the population in the near future.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS\u2022       Treatment of osteoporosis in patients with extreme side effects to MRONJADVANTAGES\u2022       The first in class treatment of off target effects to anti-resorptive medications\u2022       Minimally invasive due to shallow injectionsDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATEThe invention has been tested in-vivo in mice, and tissues that had been previously effected with anti-resorptive medications now have dense stratification of osteoclast formation as visualized by histopathological analyses.Related Papers (from the inventors only)There has not been any public disclosure of the invention",

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the department of Bioengineering have developed a biodegradable material that is capable of releasing insulin in the presence of excess glucose mimicking the insulin secretion properties of pancreatic B-cells as a treatment for Diabetes Mellitus.Background:Diabetes mellitus currently affects more than 463 million people worldwide, and it is estimated to affect more than 700 million in 2045. Insulin replacement therapy remains the current standard of care (SOC) for treating type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes. In healthy individuals, \u03b2-cells of the pancreas secret insulin that is responsible for regulating blood glucose levels (BGL). Daily administration of exogenous insulin via injection or infusion is tedious; multiple factors such as age, lifestyle, stress levels, physical activity and dietary intake affect the bioavailability and activity levels of the exogenous insulin. Therefore, a synthetic system that can mimic \u03b2-cells by releasing insulin in a glucose-dependent manner is attractive for facilitating insulin administration by maximizing effectiveness and increasing safetyTo date, various glucose-responsive insulin delivery systems, such as microneedles, hydrogels, nanoparticles or microparticles, complexes, liposomes, cells, and insulin analogs, have been extensively investigated. Of these, a glucose-responsive, charge-switchable complex has been validated with robust glucose-responsive performance in animal models. However, the non-degradable polymer backbone caused biocompatibility issues due to its low molecular weight thereby, increasing the basal insulin release rate.Therefore,  a high molecular weight biodegradable cationic macromolecule would potentially resolve this problem by enhancing the stability of insulin complex thus, reducing the basal insulin release rate. In addition, a systemic investigation of the factors affecting glucose-responsive performance is essential in guiding the design and preparation of an insulin formulation with prolonged, efficacious treatment characteristics.Innovation:UCLA researchers have developed a cationic polymer by modifying biodegradable poly(L-lysine) (PLL) with 4-carboxy-3-fluoro-phenylboronic acid (FPBA), a widely used glucose-sensing component. Subsequently, these polymers are complexed with insulin that is negatively charged at an isoelectric pH between 5.3 to 5.35; this substantially increases the polymer complex stability.This novel PLL-FPBA polymer \u2013 insulin complex has a loading efficiency higher than 90%. In different in vivo studies, this novel polymer mimicked after the pancreatic B-cells i.e., released insulin in the presence of high blood glucose levels. Researchers also found that PLL-FPBA polymer \u2013 insulin complex induced sustained release of insulin thereby, prolonging the anti-hyperglycemic effect of native insulin, extending normoglycemia for more than 20 hours and remaining effective even at 72 hours post-treatment. Thus, this proposed technology has the capacity to improve quality of life and quality of treatment of Diabetes Mellitus for hundreds of millions of people.Potential Applications:Diabetes Mellitus TreatmentBlood Glucose StabilizationGlucose Induced Anionic Drug DeliveryAdvantages:Enhanced Stability of the polymer complexSustained basal insulin release ratesResponsive to Blood Glucose LevelsBiodegradableSafeNo toxicity observedRobust response to physiological stressorsDevelopment-to-date:The novel material proposed has been developed and demonstrated in vitro as well as in vivo mouse models.Related Papers (From the inventors only):Injectable Biodegradable Polymeric Complex for Glucose-Responsive Insulin Delivery.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:UCLA researchers in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering developed an innovative thermal management system that can efficiently cool transient thermal spikes in high-power, pulsed devices.BACKGROUND:Proper thermal management is critical for electronic devices that require high power consumption. They often generate large quantities of heat that result in temperature drifts and inconsistent device performance. When temperature changes occur in a transient manner, such as in pulsed devices, it can be particularly difficult to manage, as temperatures rapidly spike and can lead to device failure if not mitigated. While conventional, steady-state cooling techniques, such as jet impingement, can be applied to transient applications, they do not inherently operate in a transient manner and do not eliminate thermal fluctuations. To improve thermal management systems in high-power, pulsed devices, such as laser diode arrays, an on-demand rapid-cooling solution is required to maintain near constant operating temperatures and consistent performance.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers have invented a rapid flash-vapor cooling system that can provide localized, repeated transient cooling to pulsed, high-power devices. This active cooling process continuously adapts to the generated heat load and can provide pulsed cooling for time periods ranging from 100 milliseconds to 10 seconds. Not only can it counteract a wide timescale of transient thermal spikes, but it can subsequently provide quasi-steady state cooling to counteract the thermal mass of devices. This technology is well suited to the performance needs of laser components, burst radars, and other high-power electronic equipment.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\n1.

    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Medicine have developed an AI/machine learning model which incorporates patient data from over a hundred features (variables) to predict patients who will have hospitalization and emergency department visits over the next year. This prospective model helps in providing proactive care to prevent future avoidable hospitalization and visits to the emergency room, lowering cost and increasing the quality of healthcare.Background:Unnecessary hospitalization and emergency department visits drain healthcare resources while incurring significant cost. Predictive models aid healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk patients who require preventive care in order to avoid costly hospitalization and emergency department visits. Unfortunately, current methods (rules-based models) of identifying at-risk patients often have low predictive performance as they are formulated from only a few factors, are non-scalable, and are not tuned for a specific population. Therefore, an adaptive and precise model for assessing at-risk patients is greatly needed to increase the quality and decrease the cost of healthcare accessible to these populations.Innovation:UCLA researchers in the Department of Medicine have developed a prospective AI/ machine learning model to predict patients at risk for future hospitalization and visits to the emergency department over the next year. This model can help to lower the cost and increase the quality of healthcare by quantifying this risk through a simple 0 to 100 risk score. This score identifies individual patients who are likely to have poor outcomes without further intervention such as through care coordination, closing care gaps, and connecting patient to required care. The model allows turning care from reactive to proactive. Moreover, the model outperforms historic rule-based models by using over a hundred features from a number of data domains as needed to make the predictions precise and specific to a given population. This model is scalable and adaptable and can be tuned to the population of a specific health system, medical group, payer, or geography.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARY:UCLA researchers in the department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering have developed an antimicrobial and osteoinductive hydrogel used for dental implants.BACKGROUND:According to the American Dental Association (ADA), more than 5 million dental implants are performed each year in the United States. The leading cause of failure for these implants is peri-implantitis (PI), a destructive inflammatory process. Best estimates are that PI occurs in up to 87.5% of patients. PI occurs when bacterial biofilms build on the surface of the implants leading to inflammation and degeneration of the surrounding bone. Current treatments include the use of mechanical/surgical debridement, traditional antibiotics, and bone forming growth factors. However, these treatments are limited due to biofilm regrowth, ineffective antibiotics, and increased cancer prevalence respectively. Therefore, there is a clear need for a solution that can reduce the prevalence of PI in dental implants that can prevent biofilm formation and promote bone growth.INNOVATION:The present invention is a dental adhesive that provides a solution to the prevalence of PI by sealing the site of implantation. This device contains highly effective local antimicrobial agents that rarely lead to antibiotic resistance as well as a local bone growth factor, which minimize traditional side effects of global administration of antibiotics and growth factors while still remaining effective. The adhesive is also polymerized using common curing lights that are used by most dentists, which allow for safe biodegradation once the dental implant has fully healed.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\nDental ImplantsPeri-implantitis treatmentNon-dental bone implantsADVANTAGES:\n\nSimple application during dental implantationUses standard equipmentLower risk of antimicrobial resistanceLower risk of antimicrobial side effectsLower risk of growth factor side effectsReduced prevalence of PILess pain and suffering for patientsNaturally derived polymerDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE: Physical product has been created and tested in animal models to demonstrate antimicrobial, bone growth and adhesive properties.Related PapersA.

    "ip_description": "Introduction:UCLA researchers in the Department of Biological Chemistry have discovered a novel mechanism to address how X-chromosome inactivation happens. Targeting specific protein-protein interactions in this biological pathway may promote reactivation of X-chromosome to treat X-linked diseases.Background:Sex differences in human disease are often attributed to sex hormones that influence the function of susceptible genes. However, a major cause of disease expression derives itself from the sex chromosome, originating in how males and females transcribe the gene-rich human X chromosome. The X chromosome carries 867 known protein-coding genes and various genes encoding long-non-coding RNAs. When pathogenic variants arise in these gene rich chromosomes, they can lead to lethal consequences.Females carry two copies of the X chromosome, and the double dose of most X-linked genes is incompatible with development. To correct this imbalance, mammalian females have evolved a unique mechanism called X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), i.e., transcriptionally silencing most of the genes on one of their two X-chromosomes. Mechanistically, the process of XCI remains elusive; yet it is well established that the long-noncoding RNA Xist mediates XCI. Understanding the underlying mechanism of XCI is critical to the development of novel gene therapy approaches for X-linked diseases.Many X-linked genes are involved in the development of diseases. As an example, several neurodevelopmental disorders in females are caused by heterozygous mutations of genes on the X chromosome, including Rett Syndrome, which is causally linked to mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2. In females with Rett Syndrome, the inactive X chromosome serves as a reservoir for the functional gene copy that could replace the expression of a disease allele from the active X chromosome. Animal studies have shown that simply reactivating or delivering this functional gene copy of MECP2 \u2013 even after disease symptoms emerge \u2013 can lead to complete reversion of neurological defects. Thus, the reactivation of the inactive X chromosome could be a key strategy for treating X-linked diseases such as Rett Syndrome. However, the major gap in applying this strategy in patients has been the lack of knowledge of how the long noncoding RNA Xist inactivates the X chromosome and the mechanisms that would lead to its reactivation.Innovation:Dr. Kathrin Plath and colleagues in the Department of Biological Chemistry at UCLA have discovered a novel mechanism to explain how X-chromosome inactivation happens. They used super resolution microscopy and detailed analysis to show how long noncoding RNA Xist (X-inactive specific transcript) guides proteins into its compartment and how this leads to a specific effect on gene expression. Their results suggest that Xist RNA can attract RNA-binding proteins mediating their macromolecular crowding via protein-protein interactions and that these protein-protein interactions are critical for gene silencing. Inhibition of these interactions may promote reactivation of X-chromosome and brings hope to cure some X-linked diseases.Applications:X-linked diseasesDiseases caused by X-inactivationAdvantages:Specific target proteins have been identifiedCould potentially treat multiple X-linked diseasesState of Development: The mechanism of how lncRNA Xist mediates X-chromosome inactivation was discovered. Currently, a series of inhibitors to block specific protein-protein interactions to promote reactivation of the inactive X chromosome are being surveyed.Related Papers (from the inventors only)Xist nucleates local protein gradients to propagate silencing across the X chromosome.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARYUCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have developed a fast embedded memory using a standard CMOS logic process that can retain data when the powered down for any reason.BACKGROUNDIn traditional static random-access memory (SRAM), data can be lost when the power supply falls below a certain voltage level. To prevent the data loss, the supply voltage of the memory needs to be maintained above a certain level at all times even when memory is idle. This will increase the memory power consumption and can cause issues in low-power applications and in applications with a low memory activity rate. While there are memories that are non-volatile, these memories require special processes and/or materials and operating conditions (such as high voltage) that may not be CMOS logic compatible.  They also tend to be of lower performance.   Hence, there is a need for a fast memory that can keep its data when the power is turned OFF. Such a memory can be used in IoT devices, implantable medical devices, systems that rely on power harvesting and see fluctuations in their power supply, and systems that work based on intermittent-computing methodology.INNOVATIONUCLA researchers in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering have designed an embedded non-volatile SRAM (nvSRAM), using Charge Trap Transistors (CTT) in a CMOS logic process, without any extra fabrication steps (such as floating gate). Because of its unique design, it can rapidly store data on chip and then quickly power down or enter a lower power mode as necessary. For example, when the memory is idle, its power supply can be turned OFF to eliminate the leakage power consumption by the idle memory. Once the power is back ON, memory can recall the original data. This design can be used as both regular SRAM and an embedded NVM for the above-mentioned applications.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONSLow-power-budget devicesCMOS Logic-based embedded non-volatile memoryIoT sensorsMedical devicesPower supply fluctuation resilient memoryADVANTAGES:Stores data despite power lossCan be used in designs with a low power budget or a fluctuating power supplyArea efficientImplemented in a CMOS logic-process with no extra fabrication stepCan be implemented in advanced nodesDevelopment to Date:This innovation has been designed and is being prototyped.Related Papers:F.

However, it is often difficult to distinguish between spectral features, complicating deconvolution of underlying processes. Furthermore, time resolved photoluminescence is often limited to the near ultraviolet or near infrared regimes and strong luminescence sources can washout weaker signals.

The novel lentiviral vector not only maintains the high infectivity seen in the widely used d19 spike pseudotype \u2013 which removes the final 19 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail \u2013 but it also elicits a greater specificity for Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing cells, thereby, aiding development of therapeutics against SARS-Cov-2 virus.BACKGROUNDACE2 receptors are extensively expressed on cell membranes of airway epithelial cells. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is primarily mediated by binding of its spike glycoprotein to the ACE2 receptor. An antibody response is elicited by the host in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A hosts\u2019 ability to protect themselves from reinfection and/or disease progression is dependent upon high affinity binding and virus neutralizing capabilities of their antibodies.Antibody neutralization activity is measured by co-culturing, a patient\u2019s plasma sample with SARS-CoV-2, which is highly infectious and replication-competent, thus, necessitating the testing to be conducted within a biosafety level-3 laboratory. Therefore, it is a critical to develop pseudotyped spike glycoprotein non-replicative viral particles specific to ACE2 expressing cells thereby, providing a high-throughput quantification method for measuring the neutralization activity of plasma antibodies.Current SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes utilize a spike glycoprotein that contains a deletion of the final 19 amino acids (d19). Although this pseudotype maintains high infectivity of ACE2 expressing cells, it also elicits off-target infection of non-ACE2 expressing cells, a characteristic that is not shared with replicative SARS-CoV-2 virus. Consequently, it is crucial to develop a pseudotyped spike with greater specificity to ACE2 expressing cells than the current d19 pseudotype to accurately study SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 transgenic mouse models or lung models such as air-liquid interface cultures.INNOVATIONDr. Donald Kohn and colleagues in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics at UCLA have developed a safe, non-replicative lentiviral vector pseudotyped with S glycoprotein from SARS-Cov-2 Spike with high specificity for ACE2 expressing cells.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARYResearchers in the UCLA Department of physiology have invented a new drug discovery system based on high throughput screening.BACKGROUNDAtomic resolution structures are critical to understanding how proteins and small molecule function, therefore being an important step in the drug discovery, development and delivery process. Traditionally, the structures of the protein-ligand interactions were investigated through macromolecular crystallography by soaking ligands into the protein crystal lattice or co-crystallizing the protein with the ligand. However, both the methods are suboptimal i.e., they either cause structural changes in the ligand or cause crystal soaked with the ligand to crack or dissolve, and in a worse case, making the crystal diffraction difficult.To address the shortcomings of macromolecular crystallography, microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED), an electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) method is alternatively used to study the atomic resolution structures for novel proteins and small drug molecules in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). This method utilizes co-crystallization of the protein and ligand prior to their application to the grid.Given the benefits of MicroED in determining atomic structures of small drug molecules a new method of characterizing the protein-ligand structures has been described here, that has the potential of substantially expediting the future drug discovery and delivery process.INNOVATIONUCLA researchers have developed a method for high throughput, on-grid soaking of ligands into protein microcrystals that is fast, simple, and effective.

EVs regulate a diverse range of biological processes, including immunomodulation and regeneration, thus representing potential therapeutic agents in these pathological areas. While EV-based therapeutics have been developing exponentially over the past few years, EVs' clinical use for immunomodulation is currently limited. Among the significant issues to be resolved is the inconsistent and unstable source of immunomodulatory EVs, namely, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Due to the lack of universal MSC culture protocols, current MSC-derived EVs bear a significant variability between batches. MSCs also have a limited lifespan and a tremendous donor-to-donor variability, further hindering a uniform population mass-production. Therefore, a new method of EV production, with better reproducibility and scalability, is in urgent need to meet the industrial standard and advance the EV-based therapeutics to the next level: clinical use.\n\nINNOVATION\nUCLA researchers in the Department of Bioengineering have developed a method to boost EVs' production and potency. Researchers utilized the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)  as an alternative source to overcome the limitation of the MSC-derived EVs. Unlike MSCs, iPSCs have defined culture conditions and protocols, which can eliminate the batch-to-batch variability. Researchers found that the iPSC-derived EVs maintained the same look and size as the MSC-EVs while demonstrating superior immunomodulatory properties compared to the MSC counterparts. Specifically, the iPSC-EVs increase the formation of regulatory T cells from both primary human and mouse T cells and augment the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Also, researchers found that mechanical stimulation of cells in a bioreactor could significantly increase EV production. This method can be applied to both MSCs and iPSCs and resulted in substantially more EV production, up to 18-fold, compared to the traditional static culture. This method did not induce changes in other properties of the EV product, such as size. Therefore, deriving EVs from iPSCs cultured in a bioreactor is a potential method for achieving large-scale clinical-grade EV manufacturing for immunomodulatory therapeutics.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS\n\u2022       Industrial production of immunomodulatory EVs\n\u2022       Supports tissue regeneration\n\u2022       Decreases the risk of transplant rejection\n\nADVANTAGES\n\u2022       Easily expandable; 18-fold increase in EV production when mechanical stimulation is applied\n\u2022       Highly reproducible; iPSCshave established culture conditions and protocols\n\u2022       Superior immunomodulation capability\n\u2022       More immunocompatible EVs could be produced if genetically modified iPSCs are used\n\nDEVELOPMENT TO DATE\nThe producibility and quality of the method have been assessed. iPS-EVs decreased batch-to-batch variability and increased immunomodulatory capabilities.

Doped GaN (Gallium Nitride) is particularly useful owing to the ultra-high breakdown voltage and low on-resistance associated with these materials. Etch and regrowth and ion implantation are common methodologies used to achieve selective area doping of GaN, however, both methods suffer limitations. Etch and regrowth induces excess defectivity at the regrowth interface and ion implementation lacks doping depth while requiring for harsh conditions during the annealing process. Therefore, there is a need to introduce a damage-free and cost-effective approach to manufacture grown-in, selective-area doped active regions on free-standing GaN substrates so the full ubiquity of these materials as transistors and semiconductor LEDs can be realized.INNOVATIONUCLA researchers in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering have developed a method to manufacture grown-in, selective-area doped active regions on free-standing GaN substrates. The method utilizes epitaxial growth (crystal growth) which imparts control over the depth of the doped layer, while achieving high uniformity in dopant concentration. Importantly, the selective-area doping profile can be realized without the need for dry etch, thus the junction interface is atomically smooth. In addition, the produced GaN substrate is suitable for vertical device structure which has greater voltage blocking capacity as well as current-handling capability.

This is the typical clinical practice for many therapeutic methods, such as hematopoietic stem progenitor cells transplant for genetic diseases and T cell transplant for delivery of chimeric antigen receptors. However, such ex vivo practice results in a much longer treatment time and higher risk of cell damage since the cells are exposed to the outside.

New biomarker sensing technologies that allow for the active collection of biofluid would expand current wearable bioanalytic applications and reliability.INNOVATIONUCLA researchers have developed a wearable and programmable active biofluidic collection and management system for biomarker analysis. The system actively and autonomously routes and compartmentalizes biofluids in addressable sensing chambers. The active biofluid control in this system can create unprecedented wearable bioanalytical capabilities at both the sensor level (eliminating the confounding effect of variation on biofluid flow rate on sensor response) and the system level (facilitating context-based sensor selection/protection). Through integration with a wireless circuit board and bilateral communication with consumer electronics (e.g., smartwatch), the on-body biomarker data acquisition and data display can be achieved.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONSBiofluid sampling for wearable electronicsBiomarker analysisBioanalyte sensorReal-time biofluid monitoringPersonalized and precision medicineADVANTAGESReal-time monitoringActive control on biofluid monitoringFast response timePortable and small in sizeRELATED MATERIALS1Y.

Independent of pathology, nearly 90% of neuroendovasccular procedures in the United States use a lower extremity artery, e.g. transfemoral access (TFA), to access the complex vasculature of the central nervous system. Adoption of other arterial access points, e.g. transradial access (TRA), have been investigated (due to their demonstrated reduction in complications, healthcare costs, and expedited patient recovery in adjacent fields such as interventional cardiology) but have had limited adoption due to concerns with successful navigation from peripheral arterial access points to the cerebral vasculature with current available devices. New neurovascular catheter that allow for controlled distal navigation without compromising stability for use with other arterial access points are needed to improve NIR procedures and patient outcomes.INNOVATIONUCLA researchers have developed a new neurovascular catheter system that utilizes soft robotic technology to provide controlled distal tip orientation as well as variable stiffness. Although the primary target for this device is in the neurovascular space, the technology can easily be translated to other endoluminal devices for other noninvasive or robotic-assisted surgeries. Specifically, the catheter system uses a series of soft robotic pneumatic actuators that can be activated to control the shape and structure of the catheter at one or more locations along the catheter length. These actuators can also be used to increase the stiffness of the catheter, allowing for the safe navigation and subsequent delivery of additional endovascular therapies (e.g. embolization coils, thrombectomy devices, flow diverters, etc).

Currently, there are three types of smart windows: photochromic, electrochromic and thermochromic. However, there are inherent disadvantages to this technology, including low transmittance at visible light range for the transparent state, high complexity and cost for fabrication, and short lifetimes. Therefore, a significant need exists for an efficient, stable and long-lifetime window treatment that can be applied inexpensively in order to reduce the global energy consumption.INNOVATIONUCLA researchers have developed an all-solid thermochromic polymer film for smart window applications. Unlike current thermochromic smart windows, the disclosed film is transparent in colder temperatures, allowing heat to enter, and becomes opaque when warmed, blocking heat. The film can be applied directly to windows or overtop a conducting layer to further enhance uniformity.

The system and method developed allows high-contrast and resolution multiplexed imaging of whole animals in real-time.\n\nBACKGROUND:Real-time, fluorescence imaging is a non-invasive optical imaging modality that holds promise in image-guided surgery and molecular diagnostics. The shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000 \u2013 2000 nm) region of the electromagnetic spectrum has provided a means to real-time monitoring of whole mammals with high contrast and resolution due to deep penetration of light through tissue and low autofluorescence. While fluorophores have been developed for this region, multiplexed experiments have been limited due to near infrared (NIR, 700 \u2013 1000 nm) excitation wavelengths of often broad and overlapping absorption profiles. To accomplish real-time multiplexed imaging in non-transparent animals, a method is needed in which 1) SWIR detection is employed for high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth; 2) fluorophores are excited at their absorbance maximum and all SWIR photons are collected to achieve ample signal and; 3) detection of each channel can occur in tandem. Custom, bright fluorophores are needed to meet requirements of excitation-multiplexing and \u201ccolor-blind\u201d detection.\nINNOVATION:UCLA researchers have developed a set of bright polymethine dyes with diverse wavelength excitation. Along with the development of a triggered multi-excitation SWIR optical configuration, they have demonstrated multiplexed whole animal imaging with high spaciotemporal resolution on the millisecond time scale. Specifically, SWIR multiplexed imaging was enabled to monitor awake mice, hepatic clearance, and orthogonal detection of the lymph and circulatory systems. The technologies developed advance the ability to monitor orthogonal function in animals, a major advance in imaging methods.

Widespread implementation of NLOS is limited by the requirement of a high-resolution, two-dimensional ultrafast camera that can process a long sequence of time-resolved data. Current NLOS-enabled cameras must perform scanning in spatial and/or temporal dimensions, lengthening the acquisition time to seconds and restricting the imaging to static or slowly-moving objects.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the David Geffen School of Medicine and CNSI have developed a nanoparticle that induces antigen tolerance for use in treatment of allergy and autoimmune diseases.\n\nBACKGROUND:When the body\u2019s immune overreacts against environmental allergens  or falsely recognizes the body\u2019s own molecular components as foreign, the results can be  serious systemic allergic disorders or autoimmune diseases. Antigen-specific immune tolerance is a desired goal for treatment of allergic and autoimmune diseases, whereby the immune system is \u2018trained\u2019 to actively turn off the immune response to  the allergens or autoimmune antigens. More specifically, immune, tolerogenic therapies can be implemented to train  a subset of immune cells, known as the regulatory T-cells to suppress the immune response to allergens and autoimmune antigens.  One pathway by which this can be accomplished is to rely on the antigen presenting cells of the liver, which specializes in tolerogenic immune responses . Nanoparticle-based therapies provide a powerful means of inducing this tolerance, by being designed to encapsulate the antigens  and display the surface targeting sequence that sends them to the liver.  The liver can then generate regulatory T-cells that can go to any organ in the body that participates in analytical autoimmune reactions.  These targeted nanoparticle therapies, provide the means to inducing highly specified immune tolerance, as opposed to widespread immunosuppression that is currently induced to treat allergy and autoimmune disorders in the clinic. These less specific immunomodulating treatments frequently lead to adverse treatment effects, , including suppression of the immune response to pathogens. Therefore, in order to avoid the usage of immunomodulators with widespread deleterious effects on the patient, there is a need to advance on available antigen-specific tolerizing therapeutics.INNOVATION:Antigen specific interventions for allergies and autoimmune disorders\u2014two groups of disorders characterized by patients\u2019 hyperactive immune response against non-pathogenic bodies\u2014are limited in number and efficacy; however, UCLA researchers present a novel nanoparticle based therapeutic platform that induces immune tolerance towards a predetermined antigen in animal models. Through targeting of tolerogenic antigen presenting cells in the liver, researchers demonstrated, as a proof of principle, that administration of nanoparticles to mouse models of asthma and anaphylaxis can reduce  these potentially fatal systemic allergic disorders.  There is also preliminary evidence that the same is true in animal models for rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and type I diabetes.  Importantly, the tolerogenic effect can be obtained by using intact, antigens  or representative epitopes in these disease models, thereby avoiding the need for nonspecific immunosuppression or immune modulatory therapies.  The tolerogenic nanoparticle platform is earmarked for treatment of a wide range of allergic disorders and autoimmune diseases.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022    Autoimmune disease treatment.\u2022    Allergy desensitization and treatment.\u2022    Prevention of  Allergic reactions to Therapeutic proteins and MedicationsADVANTAGES:\u2022    Treats cause rather than symptoms for allergies/autoimmune diseases\u2022    Targets a novel cell type in the liver that exert widespread control over systemic  immune responses.\u2022    Can be designed for intact allergens as well as specific epitopes.\u2022    Can treat a wide variety of diseases characterized by overactive, misguided immunity.DEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:Researchers have demonstrated efficacy of inducing tolerance for a protein target in animal models of asthma and anaphylaxis.\n\nRelated Papers (from the inventors only)\nLiu Q, Wang X, Liu X, Kumar S, Gochman G, Ji Y, Liao YP, Chang CH, Situ W, Lu J,  Jiang J, Mei KC, Meng H, Xia T, Nel AE.

Organic materials have low manufacturing costs while inorganic materials typically produce higher performing devices, but require expensive, complicated manufacturing. Perovskite hybrid materials have been proven to combine the high performance of inorganic materials with the flexibility of organic materials. However, the highest performing perovskite-based devices typically are fabricated using costly vacuum deposition techniques and high temperatures. Solution processing methods, along with improvements in performance, would allow the perovskite-based electronic devices to be competitive alternatives to traditional silicon and other inorganic technologies.\n\nLead halide perovskite solar cells offer excellent photovoltaic efficiencies (up to 15%), but both the perovskite material and the charge transport layers have poor stability, where the device degrades within days under normal conditions. Specifically, organic charge transport layers are important for energy level matching and charge transport, but their use is limited because they have poor device stability and are costly to fabricate. The use of inorganic materials to replace the organic transport layers offers a promising avenue to circumvent the disadvantages of these layers for solar cell applications.\n\nOver the last decade, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has increased to 23.1%, establishing perovskites as viable alternatives to the widely used silicon solar cell. Further PCE improvement can be achieved by reducing the microscale heterogeneity of the films, but conventional techniques to improve crystal growth are time consuming. Therefore, novel scalable and efficient strategies that improve microscale properties will be important to further enhance the photovoltaic properties of perovskite solar cells. Another technique for PCE improvement is adopting a tandem architecture, which uses multi-junction solar cells to harness a broader range of the solar spectrum. While this design is typically implemented in III-V semiconductors to achieve ~30% efficiencies, their high fabrication costs hinder mass commercialization. Therefore, applying tandem architectures to solution-processed perovskite solar cells could provide a pathway for improved PCEs at commercially viable costs.\n\n---\n\nApplications:\n\nGrid solar cells\nPortable solar cells\nLEDs\nField-effect transistors\nWearable electronics\n\nAdvantages:\n\nHigh performance electronic devices, including solar cells with up to ~23% efficiency\nSolution processable \u2013 low-cost and versatile manufacturing\nUses inexpensive, well-studied materials for many layers\nMay use a variety of substrates, including flexible plastics\nEnhanced and controlled reconstruction between organic and inorganic components during film formation leading to superior device performance\nContinuous, compact, large grain size, full surface coverage of PVSK thin films\nTechnique applicable to a range of substrates and devices including flexible films, multi-junction solar cells, LEDs, sensors and superconductors",

    "ip_description": "SUMMARYUCLA researchers have developed a new high-resolution color microscopy technique termed Demosaiced Pixel Super-Resolution (D-PSR), which significantly improves the performance of holographic high-resolution color imaging.BACKGROUNDDigital holography refers to the acquisition and processing of holograms with a digital sensor array, typically a CCD camera or a similar device. Digital holography has became one of the most widely explored computational microscopy techniques because it permits high-throughput 3D imaging of phase and amplitude information of specimen  To achieve color imaging in digital holography various methods have been employed. One of the most commonly used approaches sequentially captures three holograms at different wavelengths and then digitally cross-registers and combines these holograms to reconstruct a color image of the specimen.As an alternative to this sequential color illumination method, simultaneous multi-wavelength illumination of the sample has also been utilized in combination with a color imager chip (e.g., with a Bayer color-filter array, CFA) to digitize the resulting multi-color hologram in one snap-shot. Compared to sequential color illumination, this simultaneous illumination approach saves experimental time. However, the reconstructed color images are lower resolution and exhibit color artifacts.To better handle these artifacts, different Bayer demosaicing approaches have been proposed. However these methods are still short of creating an artifact-free de-multiplexing of holographic high frequency fringes created by multi-wavelength illumination.INNOVATIONUCLA researchers have developed a new high-resolution color microscopy technique, which solves Bayer CFA related spatial sampling limitations and color artifacts of previous color de-multiplexing approaches, significantly improving the performance of holographic high-resolution color imaging. This D-PSR approach first captures a plurality of raw holograms on a Bayer color sensor chip using simultaneous multi-wavelength illumination, where the sensor plane is shifted by small increments. Then it performs pixel super-resolution based on these sub-pixel shifted raw holograms to digitally synthesize smaller pixels (e.g., by a factor of ~3 fold) for each element of the Bayer CFA. Using the pre-calibrated spectral cross-talk matrix of each filter of the Bayer CFA at the selected illumination wavelengths, this approach de-multiplex three color channels, each of which is also pixel super-resolved.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS1.Wavelength-multiplexing2.High-resolution holographic color imaging3.MicroscopyADVANTAGES1.D-PSR significantly alleviates Demosaicing induced holographic color artifacts through the digital synthesis of spatially overlapping and much smaller effective pixels in each color channel.2.In D-PSR, the pixel-level spectral cross-talk of a Bayer CFA is compensated by digital de-multiplexing.3.Compared to holographic color imaging using sequential multi-wavelength illumination, D-PSR takes 3-fold less number of raw holograms/measurements while also achieving a very similar color imaging performance.RELATED MATERIALS1.Wu, Y., Zhang, Y., Luo, W. et al.

While effective in reducing the modality rate due to breast cancer, mammography only provides a 2D image and is unable to differentiate overlapping tissues in the projection direction (particularly in patients with dense breast tissue). Paired with the compression required for mammography that can be hard to tolerate for some patients, new methods are needed for 3D breast cancer detection and diagnosis.INNOVATIONUCLA researchers have developed a 3D supine breast CT that can better detect and diagnose breast cancer. Unlike other breast CTs that are performed in both the prone and upright positions, this supine breast CT is performed in the supine position. It is compatible with interventional procedures without sacrificing patient comfort. The system allows for auto- position and angular adjustment, and registers the 3D geometry relative to the room. The detector, which is separate from the X-ray tube, can be used for short scan CBCT, obtaining sufficient data for 3D reconstruction while minimizing patient imaging dose. Lastly, this method can potentially be used with radiotherapy and treatment, making it a potential CT/radiotherapy integrated system.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS1.Breast cancer diagnosis2.Breast cancer radiotherapyADVANTAGES1.CT is performed in the supine position2.High-resolution 3D image3.Better outer design to eliminate collision hazard4.Better/more comfortable patient experienceSTATUS OF DATEThe device has been assembled and successfully demonstrated.",

Compensated polarized light microscopy (CPLM), the current gold standard method for pathological crystal identification, uses polarized light to detect changes in the optical birefringence of a tissue and used to diagnose pathologies such as squamous cell carcinoma and gout. CPLM, however, offers only qualitative data for diagnosis and is subject to the experience of the user to detect low-contrast features, such as that of smaller crystals or crystals with weak birefringence.

Self-power nodes, which are long-lifetime sensors that do not require batteries, are ideal for RFID applications owing to their small (millimeter) size. Miniaturization of RFID antennas and storage components often reduces the power transfer efficiency, leading to challenges in data communication.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the Departments of Medicine and Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics have developed a novel combination therapy for enhanced efficacy of Adoptive T Cell Therapies (ACT): that could enable the adoption of ACT as an effective means to combat multiple cancer subtypes.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nThe clinical relevancy of cancer immunotherapy has grown exponentially in the past decade, showing little surprise that its market is expected to reach nearly $153 billion by 2024. The most promising clinical approach of immunotherapy has proven to be Adoptive T Cell Therapy (ACT), showing efficacy to treat cancers that conventional treatment strategies show poor effect for (e.g., small molecule chemotherapeutics, or surgical intervention). ACT utilizes the effective recognition of cancer cells through specific antigen presentation: lowering the significant incidence of off target toxicities common to other treatment strategies. In ACT, a patients\u2019 T cells are removed, cultured ex vivo for population expansion, and then infused back into the patient. This pathway increases the number of T cells that can target cancer cells effectively. Unfortunately, there is mounting clinical evidence to suggest that many cancer subtypes can resist infiltration by these reinfused T cells, by utilizing the tumor microenvironment to weaken T cell activation. Research suggests that natural signaling pathways that activate lymphocytes, like cytokine signaling (e.g., interferons (IFNs)) may allow an effective means to promote T cell activation in the otherwise deleterious tumor microenvironment. However, injection of IFN is subject to rapid clearance due to systemic dilution, that leads to limited efficacy. Therefore, a great unmet need exists for novel approaches that with allow increased clinical efficacy of ACT.\n\nINNOVATION:\n\nDr. Timmerman and colleagues have developed a novel methodology for enhancing the efficacy of ACT for cancer treatment. IFNs are infused to tumor-targeting antibodies as a payload, that can be directly delivered to the tumor site. Direct delivery of the IFN payload allows the T cells delivered by ACT, to overcome the tumor microenvironment and its effects in deactivating effector T cells. Murine model studies have shown that ACT therapy when combined with this payload method, results in double the tumor killing potential. Further studies elucidated that the IFN treatment led to significant increases in peripheral cytokine concentrations, that may further allow effector T cells the ability to overcome the tumor microenvironment. The presented methodology allows a unique and effective method for the direct delivery of cytokines that could allow increased clinical efficacy of ACT therapy: opening novel treatment strategies to various cancers that may lower incidences of off target toxicities observed in traditional treatment pathways.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\n\u2022       Enhancement of adoptive cell therapy (ACT)\n\u2022       Enhancement of CAR T cell therapy\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n\u2022       Combination treatment leads to improved tumor killing compared to T cell treatment alone\n\u2022       Improved efficacy compared to combination therapy with antibody alone (rituximab)\n\u2022       Cytokine levels are increased, causing sensitization of tumor cells\n\u2022       IFN-antibody can target tumor sites in all locations of the body\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:\n\nIFN-antibody fusion proteins have been prepared and in vitro experiments using a variety of cell lines have demonstrated their efficacy when used in combination with adoptive cell therapy.

While there exists many solution-state characterization techniques like Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR), Liquid Chromatography tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS), or Gas Chromatography tandem Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), many of these methods have severe limitations (e.g., NMR-silent nuclei, or the method being destructive to the target sample). Instead, solid state analysis often conducted through crystallography remains an attractive method for identifying the underlying chemical structure of materials. Crystallography originated with studies made possible by X-rays, but severe limitations like sufficient crystal size (~ 0.1 mm3), often reduce the practicality of the technique. As an alternative, modern crystallographers make use of techniques like electron crystallography, that circumvents the need for large crystals. Unfortunately, electron crystallography techniques like microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) were developed for protein structures from frozen-hydrated crystals.

Moreover, the system is compatible with commercially available microscopes found in common research facilities. The researchers showed high practicality in adoption of the technique by applying its use in the determination of atomic resolution on samples that had not undergone formal crystallization and were isolated from simple purification techniques like flash chromatography.

Activation of T cells begins through the engagement of T cell receptors (TCRs) with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). It is additionally recognized that activation of the TCR by MHC engagement requires a mechanical force. Ex vivo cultivation of T cells is vital for manufacturing several different cellular therapies (e.g., chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapies), so much attention has been devoted to optimizing polyclonal T cell cultivation. While many advances have been made with polymer beads coated with stimulatory factors, known as artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs), ex vivo cultivation of T cells is still unfavorable. Additional studies have shown that the mechanical force necessary to activate TCRs, can be substituted by exogenous sources. However, this process entailed contact with single T cells and thus would not be compatible with large numbers of T cells. Therefore, a current need exists to utilize advances in aAPCs, while also facilitating the need for exogenous forces that will trigger efficient ex vivo T cell activation for several clinical and experimental needs.\n\nINNOVATION:\nUCLA researchers have developed a suite of novel spherical aAPCs of varying sizes and densities that can be coupled with an oscillatory stimulus to promote efficient T cell activation. The developed aAPCs were constructed to offer various degrees of curvature for enhanced TCR engagement with coated stimulatory factors. The oscillatory stimulus was delivered to the T cell culture spiked with aAPCs, to determine the ability to stimulate the TCR, for increased T cell activation. External stimuli, coupled with the developed aAPCs dramatically improved activation beyond the conventional Dynabead-based approach to T cell activation: promoting the cellular proliferation of T cells by a factor of two. The researchers further tested the ability to activate induced regulatory T cells (iTreg), that are particularly sensitive to high levels of stimulation. Under optimized conditions, the aAPCs showed an almost three-fold higher induction of iTreg cells compared to Dynabeads. The researchers further showed the ability to endow the aAPCs with the ability to secrete cytokines to promote iTreg development. These examples show that external mechanical stimulus coupled with tunable aAPCs (e.g., size/curvature, signal density, and cytokine secretion) offer the ability to engineer T cells in a highly efficient manner for a variety of clinical and experimental needs.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\u2022       Activation of T cells ex vivo\n\u2022       Inductions of induced regulatory T cells ex vivo\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\u2022       Higher activation and proliferation rates of T cells compared to conventional methods\n\u2022       Greater induction of induced regulatory T cells\n\u2022       Ability to secrete cytokines to further promoter induced regulatory T cell production\n\u2022       Range of sizes and densities of artificial antigen-presenting cells\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:\nThree libraries of artificial antigen-presenting cells have been developed and tested.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology have developed a treatment that could mitigate some mental issues related to various intellectual disabilities syndromes.\n\nBACKGROUND:Approximately 6.5 million people in the United states have an intellectual disability syndrome, classified as an IQ of less than 70. These mental disability disorders, although not impossible to overcome, have no effective treatments to improve or regulate symptoms. This, unfortunately, requires many patients to require constant care costing around 14 to 57 billion dollars annually. Recently, researchers studying these syndromes have uncovered that many are linked to improper regulation of patient genes. If methods could be developed to help regulate these genes, a possible treatment could be developed that would help mitigate many of the issues related to intellectual disability. Therefore, a current unmet need exists for a treatment that can help address many of the phenotypic symptoms and improve the lives of millions of patients suffering from an intellectual disability.\n\nINNOVATION:UCLA researchers in the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology have developed a set of small molecules that may reduce some of the issues related to intellectual disabilities syndrome. Previously, these researchers discovered a unique cellular phenotype within the brains of patients diagnosed with intellectual disabilities. As such, they developed a set of small molecules targeting this particular phenotype, resulting in the cells reverting to a normal phenotype. This was further tested with specialized organoid cultures, which simulated tissues from patients with intellectual disabilities syndrome. By testing their molecules against these models, the inventors showed that their treatment reduced the phenotypic severity in diseased cells. This causes several of these cells to become normal compared to untreated samples. As no known cure or treatment has been discovered for any intellectual disabilities, this advancement could be the beginning of treatments to help patients with intellectual disabilities.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\u2022    Intellectual Disabilities Treatment\n\u2022    Stress Treatments\n\u2022    Mental Aging Disorders\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\u2022    Bypasses Body\u2019s Natural Defenses such as Blood Brain Barrier\n\u2022    Small Molecule Therapeutic\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:The inventors have discovered a set of small molecules.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the Department of Molecular and Cell & Developmental Biology have developed novel therapeutic strategy to treat intellectual disability disorders discovered via a screening platform for drug discovery in a human model of brain development.BACKGROUND:Rett syndrome is an X-linked genetic neurological disease associated with loss of function mutations in the gene MECP2, which was originally identified as encoding a methylated DNA binding protein. Rett syndrome strikes all racial and ethnic groups predominantly in females, and occurs worldwide in 1 of every 10,000 births. Currently, there is no drug approved for Rett syndrome, and the disease symptoms (i.e. breathing disorder, seizure) are often managed by off-label drugs. There is an unmet need for developing treatments for Rett syndrome and other intellectual disability disorders, such as KAT6A syndrome.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers led by Professor William Lowry have developed a state of the art screening platform for drug discovery in a human model of brain development and have identified novel therapeutics to treat intellectual disability disorders. Based on a previously described in vitro human model system derived from iPSCs (UCLA Ref: 2017-432-1), the researchers further developed a model system generated from brain organoids, or mini-brain-like structures that represent the human fetal brain at early-mid gestational ages. The researchers found that loss of MECP2, as commonly found in Rett patients, resulted in a nearly complete loss of inhibitory neuron function, P53 induction and senescence initiation, leading to loss of appropriate neuronal network activity and induction of aberrant synchronized spikes that are reminiscent of epileptic activity observed in Rett patients. Using the drug-screening platform based on brain organoids, the researchers identified a potent inhibitor of senescence that restored normal inhibitory neuron function. They further modified the compound to increase activity and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability as well as decrease toxicity. These inventions provide not only a potential clinical path for Rett Syndrome and other intellectual disability syndromes that show similar etiology (KAT6A syndrome, among potentially many others), but also provide a screening platform for drug discovery in a human model of brain development.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022 Novel treatment for Rett syndrome and other intellectual disability disorders\u2022 State-of-art screening platform for drug discovery in a human model of brain developmentADVANTAGES:\u2022 Compounds were synthesized with increased activity, low toxicity, and BBB permeability\u2022 Novel drug-screening platform that recapitulates the human brain development as well as disease phenotypes associated with intellectual disability disordersDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:This invention has been developed and tested in brain organoids.Related Papers (from the inventors only)Ohashi M, Korsakova E, Allen D, et al.

    "ip_description": "Case 2020-386\n\nUCLA researchers from the Department of Medicine have created a novel multi-omics approach to investigating immune health.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAll living organisms have developed a highly conserved and regulated response to cope with a broad spectrum of stressful stimuli, including strenuous exercise. Exercise exerts beneficial physiological effects and has the potential to delay, halt, or even reverse declines in immune function. During exercise, cell-free DNA (cf DNA), including nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA), are produced by cellular injury and interact with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This leads to alterations in the PBMC gene expression profile and the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine mediators. During intense bouts of physical activity in healthy individuals, production and removal of cf-mtDNA from circulating blood act as an anti-inflammatory mechanism. Therefore, regular exercise provides health benefits by reducing systemic inflammation.\n\nIn contrast to healthy individuals, patients with chronic disease conditions like heart failure (HF), have an adrenergic system that is permanently activated: exhibiting a maladaptive pro-inflammatory equilibrium. This maladaptive pro-inflammatory response, leads to chronic disease patient populations with poor exercise tolerance. While mechanistic links have been postulated between inflammation, muscle weakness, frailty, catabolic/anabolic imbalance, aberrant chronic activation of immunity, and chronic fatigue syndrome, these links have not been clinically translated to increasing exercise tolerance, showing poor utility. One potentially powerful approach to the identification of clinically relevant factors to increase exercise tolerance in individuals with chronic disease, is the use of multi-omics. Cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) testing, which is routinely performed in clinical settings as a standard assessment of cardiorespiratory fitness, may be combined with techniques that survey the immune health of individuals to holistically build an immunological patient profile. The outcome of such an approach, could hold enormous implications in the prediction and treatment recommendations of patients.\n\nINNOVATION\n\nUCLA researchers propose to identify a unique multi-omics model that can serve as a tool for investigating the biology of immune health concerning prognosis, monitoring, and response to therapy in a given person. They have developed the concept of a novel multi-omics model called MyExerciseLeukoMAP that can serve as a tool for investigating a patient\u2019s immune health. This approach profiles cell-free DNA, mRNA, peripheral blood subpopulations, and cytokine levels of blood samples before, after, and during a patient undergoes a cardiopulmonary exercise to build a complete immunological patient profile. MyExerciseLeukoMAP can also be used to uncover the connection between cell-free DNA and immunological health.

A majority of the post-surgical dislocations were attributed to incorrect positioning, even though the approved absolute/static cup position measures were within the \u201csafe zone\u201d prior to surgery. This safe zone fails to take into consideration other issues, such as degenerative disk disease or arthritis. Better measures and methods are needed to reduce the number of post-surgery dislocations and improve patient outcomes.INNOVATION:Researchers at UCLA have developed a method to measure the optimal hip angle for individualized hip replacement.

Many severe primary immune deficiencies (PIDs) are due to defects in lymphoid or hematopoietic cells that can be reconstituted through hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Unlike allogeneic HSCT wherein cells are taken from a donor, gene therapy using a patient\u2019s own HSCs has potential advantages for the absence of graft-versus-host disease and requires less intense conditioning and immune suppression. HSC-targeted gene editing technologies using engineered nucleases such as CRISPR/Cas9 allow for the safe, site-specific correction of disease-causing mutations and have shown promising clinical benefits in multiple diseases. Correction of specific disease-causing mutations extends the potential applications of gene therapy to dominant disorders in addition to those resulting from simple loss-of-function mutations. Despite advancements, development efficient, selective and precise gene-editing therapies is absent for many disease-causing mutations.\n\nINNOVATION:\n\nUCLA researchers have optimized the gene editing process for X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (XHIM), a genetic condition caused by mutations in the CD40LG gene that affects the immune system.

Aromatic compounds are widely used as synthetic chemical precursors due to their ease of accessibility and great abundance in nature. However, aromatic molecules often have limited reactivity given their resonance energy stability. Current strategies for post-polymerization modification suffer from low conversion and yields as well as the use of hard-to-remove metal catalysts.

This ROMP chemistry is capable of diverse N-functionalization, as well as unprotected lactams, which may be subject to post-polymerization modification for use in biomedical applications. Alternatively, Dewar pyrones may be converted to \u03b2-chloroester polymers, which are then modified to ester-substituted poly(acetylene) possessing high solubility in various organic solvents.

    "published_date": "2020",
    "ip_description": "Summary:UCLA researchers in the Department of Biological Chemistry and Physiology have developed a novel method to collect MicroED datasets using a direct electron detector.Background:Microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) is a method in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) that exploits the strong interaction of electrons with matter to determine high-resolution molecular structures from crystallized samples. This technique is particularly useful for samples that may be sensitive to the beam used in conventional X-ray crystallography, allowing damage-free structure elucidation to be completed.  When this technique is used in conjunction with a transmission electron microscope (TEM), small molecule samples can have their structure determined with high accuracy directly from powders without crystallization: outperforming conventional X-ray crystallography. In MicroED, crystals are continuously rotated in the electron beam of a TEM, and a high-speed camera is used to record a shutterless movie of the resulting diffraction patterns. Direct electron detecting (DED) cameras are equipped on the majority of current TEMs in the cryo-EM field. However, it was previously thought that DED cameras were incompatible with this setup because of concerns over damage to the sensor by the intense incident beam as well as strong diffraction reflections. This has limited the practicality of MicroED as a technique because it required a dedicated camera that is not typically used in other cryo-EM modalities. Considering the multitude of benefits of MicroED, there exists a current need for a way to make the technique more approachable for widespread adoption.Innovation:UCLA researchers have used MicroED to collect essentially damage-free structure solution in a TEM while utilizing a DED camera. The researchers compared collected MicroED data from a series of microcrystals, using a DED and a conventional diffraction-optimized camera. Importantly, the DED was fitted with a thick scintillator to ensure the reliable capture of weak intensity Bragg spots. The researchers showed that a reliable structure solution was possible using the DED, and offered some unique advantages over the conventional diffraction-optimized camera setup. Notably, the DED setup allowed the collection of data at lower exposures in shorter time frames. This has immediate implications for efforts to automate MicroED data collection, where the efficient use of shared resources may be a significant concern, but also leads to structural models with reduced radiation damage. As a consequence, the researchers have provided a method to make MicroED more approachable to a wide range of researchers, potentially revolutionizing the field of structure determination.Potential Applications:\u2022       Higher resolution of MicroED structures\u2022       Small molecules\u2022       Natural products\u2022       Drug discoveryAdvantages:\u2022       Increased practicality of MicroED technique due to it not needing a dedicated camera\u2022       The ability for MicroED to be integrated as a shared resource with high-throughput capability\u2022       Decreased amount of damage to the same due to low-radiation\u2022       Femtogram amounts of material used for atomic resolution structuresDevelopment to Date:This method has been developed and optimized on proteinase K microcrystals.Related Materials:Hattne, J., Martynowycz, M., Gonen, T.

Particular cannabinoid formulations have been approved as prescription drugs for the treatment of various aliments plaguing patients, including nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy as well as anorexia and cachexia related to HIV/AIDS. Although cannabinoids have significant benefits in human health, low abundance in the native plant and legal regulations surrounding Cannabis has prevented studies of additional medical applications of these compounds. In particular, the large scale chemical synthesis of cannabinoids has remained elusive due to the complex chemical structures of cannabinoids. There is an unmet need for a sustainable strategy to synthesize cannabinoids at high titers.\n\nINNOVATION:\n\nScientists at UCLA have established a method for the synthesis of olivetolic acid and its analogues with high yields, using fungal biosynthetic machinery. Olivetolic acid is a central intermediate that links simple building blocks to form intricate late-stage compounds during microbial fermentation of cannabinoids. In contrast to previous methods of olivetolic acid synthesis, this in situ synthetic process does not rely on the collaboration of tetraketide synthase and olivetolic acid cyclase enzymes, and does not require a constant supply of hexanoyl-CoA precursor.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the Department of Bioengineering have optimized the sealing properties of naturally derived biopolymers, without altering their other attractive abilities like biodegradation.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nA significant number of emergency room cases consist of wound-related injuries. While the body is particularly adapted to treat various types of damages to tissue, certain wounds may be too severe for the body to handle. Further exacerbating this issue lie certain underlying health complications like diabetes, which may further limit the body\u2019s ability to close wounds. Due to this unmet healthcare need, much research interest has been invested into tissue sealants. Unfortunately, many initially successful methods made use of certain materials that would need to be removed once the wound has been closed. While this may not pose an issue for epidermal wound closure, damages that are closer to bodily organs would need a separate surgical extraction process. Instead, much attention has been given to the field of naturally derived biopolymers that can be readily degraded by the body once the wound has been closed. Despite many of their advantages, biopolymers typically lack mechanical robustness rendering them weak sealants. Therefore, a need remains to make use of the various advantages of naturally derived biopolymers while also solving issues relating to their sealing capabilities.\n\nINNOVATION:\nUCLA researchers in the Department of Bioengineering have optimized the sealing properties of naturally derived biopolymers, without altering their other attractive abilities like biodegradation.  The mechanical robustness of the biopolymer is enhanced through the addition of a small concentration of synthetic, biocompatible polymer. Through a series of studies, the researchers found an optimal concentration of synthetic polymer that could be added before leading to detrimental sealing strength. The engineered biopolymer can effectively close tissue while also providing an adhesive barrier against fluid leakage. Comparative to commercially available sealants, the engineered biopolymer can outperform while also offering attractive qualities like cost-effective fabrication and biodegradation. Aside from use as a tissue sealant, the engineered biopolymer may have further uses in the fields of drug delivery, hygiene, paint, biomedicine (e.g., peptide/protein stabilization, immunomodulating implants), and hydrogel probes. The researchers speculate that this engineered biopolymer will serve as the first in the new emergence of highly adhesive biodegradable hydrogels for advanced biomedical applications worldwide.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\u2022 Use as a tissue sealant that offers direct biodegradation for removal\n\u2022 The use as a drug delivery system\n\u2022 Paint additive for reductions in carbon footprint in manufacturing\n\u2022 Use in hygiene industry (e.g., dental implants for improved mechanical robustness)\n\u2022 Additionally, can be engineered to be suitable for more widespread applications:\n- Promote cell adhesion/infiltration or prevent cell adhesion\n- Promote tissue regeneration\n- Provide blood clotting action\n- Substitute suture in anastomosis procedure without bonding to other biomedical devices,\n- Applied to lesions on demand and further crosslinked upon visible light exposure\n- Be easily removed from tissue in the case of unwanted application\n- Be involved in minimally-invasive medical procedures\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\u2022 Enables the fine-tuning of sealing properties of hydrogels without significantly changing biodegradation potential, swelling, and other physical properties pertinent to successful clinical translation\n\u2022 Enhances the tissue sealing properties of naturally derived hydrogels beyond the performance of commercially available sealants using a facile hybridization method\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:\nThe biopolymer composition has been successfully developed and tested against single component hydrogels. Furthermore, the biopolymer composition has been shown to form an effective tissue adhesive gel able to seal defects in tissue and prevent leakage of bodily fluid.\n\nRELATED PAPERS:\n\u2022 Sani, E.S., Kheirkhah, A., Rana, D., Sun, Z., Foulsham, W., Sheikhi, A., Khademhosseini, A., Dana, R. and Annabi, N., 2019.

Existing forms of deep learning use either 3D print or lithography to create tandem sheets of networks that use input sensory information to recognize patterns and compute an image using designated algorithms. Diffractive deep neutral networks, deep learning networks that use optical computing instead of 3D print or lithography, has been investigated to tackle tasks such as object classification\u2014the 3D version of image recognition.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers from the Department of Pediatrics have uncovered a novel inhibitor to the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.BACKGROUND:Airways in the throat play a vital role in host defense to protect mammals from airborne pathogens. This protective effect is accomplished by a specialized type of epithelium, the mucocillary epithelium, that comes from adult airway basal stem cells (ABSCs). When cells in the airway are wounded, signaling through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is crucial for ABSC cells to proliferate and then differentiate into mucocillary epithelial cells. If the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is dysregulated, the ABSC cells hyper-proliferate and do not properly form mucocillary epithelial cells. Dysregulated repair can lead to various pathologies, including ABSC hyperplasia and stepwise progression to squamous lung cancer. Methods to prevent the dysregulation of this pathway remain elusive.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers conducted a high-throughput drug screen for inhibitors of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. They uncovered a compound named Wnt Inhibitor Compound 1 (WIC1). The molecule was applied to an in vitro model of ABSC hyperproliferation and was able to reverse the hyperproliferation process and promote ciliated cell differentiation. WIC1 remained nontoxic even at concentrations as high as 10 \uf06dM.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022 Promote normal airway repair after injury, such as smoke inhalation or a viral infection\u2022 Treatment of pulmonary diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\u2022 Research tool for Wnt/B-catenin signalingADVANTAGES:\u2022 Suppresses T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) activity\u2022 Reduces ABSC proliferation\u2022 Induces ciliated cell differentiation\u2022 Decreases nuclear p-\u03b2-cateninY489DEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:The inhibitor was screened on mouse ABSC and human ABSC cell lines.RELATED PAPERS:Aros, C.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers from the Department of Head and Neck Surgery have developed a novel optical imaging method for surgical guidance.BACKGROUND:Biomedical imaging is an indispensable tool to guide in precise tumor removal in comprehensive cancer surgery. Imaging strategies like x-ray, ultrasound, and MRI are principally used to localize large tumors prior to operation. During an operation, the surgeon typically relies on white light reflectance, his or her tactile senses, and intermittent tissue biopsy to identify a tumor\u2019s boundaries. Accuracy varies widely based on the experience of the surgeon, the pathologist, and the location and type of tumor. Standard technology during operation is lacking and underscores this pressing medical need.INNOVATION:In order to better identify the location of a tumor during surgery, UCLA researchers have created a novel method called dynamic optical contrast imaging (DOCI). DOCI uses a pulse of light to determine the characteristic auto-fluorescence wavelengths and lifetime of tissues. Cancer cells have different auto-fluorescence patterns than normal tissue because of changes in biochemistry, metabolism, and structure of the tissue. This technique works with complex samples, low signal-to-noise ratios, and even with blockages in the surgical field (blood, sweat, hair, etc.). DOCI is superior to other fluorescence lifetime imaging approaches because it has a simplified computational technique which allows near real time imaging and also produces a better signal to noise ratio. Additionally, DOCI can be used with low cost LEDs instead of expensive lasers because of its computational technique.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\u2022 Determine tumor location during surgery\u2022 Detect potential tumor\u2022 Determine the stage of cancerADVANTAGES:\u2022 Near real time imaging\u2022 Significant contrast under low signal-to-noise\u2022 Can use low-cost LEDs\u2022 Works even with obscured surgical field-of-viewDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:This technology has been tested on patients undergoing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or primary hyperthyroidism.RELATED PAPERS:I.

    "ip_description": "UCLA researchers in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering have developed a novel treatment to prevent cerebral atrophy after stroke through the injection of a gel into the stroke core.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nStroke is the leading cause of adult long-term disability and affects 795,000 Americans every year. Immediately following stroke onset, the lack of oxygen and nutrients causes significant cell death, a large influx of microglia/macrophages and the activation of highly reactive astrocytes, which release pro-inflammatory cytokines, and lead to further neuronal death and a clearance of cellular debris. Over time, the brain\u2019s defense mechanism is to compartmentalize the injured tissue from the surrounding tissue via an astrocytic and fibrotic scar, preventing repair in the stroke core. With time the stroke core is devoid of vessels and axons and cerebral atrophy occurs (brain shrinkage). There are currently no therapies to prevent or treat cerebral atrophy, which is correlated with dementia, depression, and reduced motor function.\n\nINNOVATION:\n\nUCLA researchers have developed a novel treatment to prevent celebral atrophy after stroke through the injection of a gel into the stroke core. The direct injection of a hyaluronic acid based microporous annealed particle (HA-MAP) hydrogel into the stroke core reduces the percent of highly inflammatory astrocytes and increases the percent of pro-repair microglia in and around the lesion. Furthermore, HA-MAP hydrogel promotes reparative astrocyte infiltration into the lesion, which directly coincides with axonal penetration into the lesion. Overall, the injection of a porous scaffold into the stroke core can lead to clinically relevant decrease in cerebral atrophy and modulates the phenotype of astrocytes and microglia towards a pro-repair phenotype.\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\n\u2022 Prevent cerebral atrophy after stroke\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n\u2022 Modulates astrocytes and microglia towards a pro-repair phenotype\n\n\u2022 Decrease inflammation after stroke\n\n\u2022 Promote astrocyte infiltration into the lesion\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:\n\nThis invention has been developed and tested in stroke mouse model.",

    "ip_description": "BACKGROUNDWound closure devices for internal luminal repair have historically been limited to staples (nondegradable, commonly titanium), sutures, and/or adhesives. The urinary tract in particular is an area in which sutured repairs with bioabsorbable sutures remain the standard closure mechanism due to the risk of stones and UTIs with staples and the need for watertight repairs to avoid urine leak. In lower urinary tract reconstruction in particular, standard-of-care procedures have a 30 to 60% complication rate within 30 days post\u2013operatively in the management of congenital and acquired conditions, such as spina bifida, bladder exstrophy, and bladder malignancies. The innovations presented here provide wound closure mechanisms for use in internal luminal repairs that will improve the feasibility of a variety of tissue repairs that occur within the body including congenital and acquired conditions.SUMMARIESBio-Zipper Urethral Closure Device (UC Case No. 2019-816)Researchers in the UCLA Department of Urology and California Nano System Institute have developed a biodegradable microneedle for operative closure and structural support of the urethra post urethral surgery. The bio-inspired, biodegradable microneedle designed by researchers at UCLA is designed to facilitate epithelial inversion, minimize urine leak, alleviate tension along the full extent of the ventral urethral closure site and prevent localized laminar flow effects. The device supports urethra structure, limiting postoperative urethral catheterization and allow the patient to resume voiding after completion of the reconstructive procedure. Lastly, the device minimize effects on vascularization from the underlying corporal bodies.Biotape Closure Device (UC Case No. 2020-867)Researchers in the UCLA Department of Urology and California Nano System Institute have developed a biodegradable surgical closure device with a flexible base that can be adhered to either side of an incision to draw it closed. The device can aid in performance of complex minimally invasive procedures such as bladder reconstruction, a method of bladder closure that decreases the time and learning curve required while maintaining a tension-free, watertight repair. The device can be used extraluminal or intraluminal to \u2018drawstring close\u2019 the tissue together. The device can be used during the repair of congenital and acquired conditions without requiring penetration/stapling, minimizing early postoperative complications.

    "ip_description": "The Manish Butte laboratory in the UCLA Department of Immunology, Allergy, and Rheumatology takes a clinical and translational approach to understanding T cells, the major coordinating cells of the immune response. Upon infection or conventional vaccination an immune response is triggered, priming na\u00efve T and B cells to recognize certain molecules from the pathogen as invaders. These molecules, called antigens, are present on all viruses and bacteria. In response to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, Dr. Butte and colleagues have pioneered an approach to empirically identify antigenic peptides to influenza viruses. These novel, synthetic peptide ligands should stimulate antibody production and provide the same protective immunity as natural antigens.\n\nThis new method of identifying TCRs and screening TCR-binding ligands will open new avenues for prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic interventions in the fields of infection (more effective vaccines), allergy (eliciting tolerance to food antigens), autoimmunity (eliciting tolerance to self-antigens), and transplantation (eliciting tolerance to alloantigens). Specifically, researchers in the Butte lab are developing this novel approach of screening and detecting ligands for T-cell receptors for SARS-CoV-2. These antigens will ultimately be incorporated into vaccines and tested in mouse models to monitor conferred immunity to COVID-19. This approach will have a major impact on vaccinology: enabling the possibility of developing effective vaccines without knowing the proteome of the pathogen as an initial step. Therefore, the time to a vaccine for epidemics of unknown etiology such as COVID-19, will be greatly reduced. These ground breaking vaccines will provide more durable responses at lower doses, which allows for more vaccines to be produced faster from limited supplies.",

Specifically, the lab is working to identify host genes that are essential for bacterial toxins to exert their effects. Dr. Bradley has previously collaborated with researchers in the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry to develop a series of novel small molecule inhibitors of endosomal trafficking. The inhibitors may be used to disrupt the cellular entry of bacterial toxins and viruses that require trafficking to acidified endosomes. Such molecules, as well as continued exploration of antimicrobial and antiviral pathways in the Bradley lab, are promising technologies for application to COVID-19 treatment and prevention.\n\nThe endocytic pathway is a crucial host cell process consisting of distinct membrane compartments, which internalize molecules from the cellular membrane and recycle them back to the surface or target them for degradation. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, rely on the fusion of their viral envelope with the host cell membrane to deliver their nucleocapsid into the host via endocytosis. Small molecule inhibitors that disrupt the binding, entry, and trafficking of bacterial toxins or viruses could be developed as novel therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of such infectious diseases.

    "ip_description": "SUMMARYUCLA researchers in the Department of Radiology have developed a novel catheter design that incorporates large drainage holes and a secondary flushing tube to allow for enhanced clearage of viscous biological fluids. Additionally, they have designed a control unit that enables continuous operation for catheter maintenance.BACKGROUND:Most existing catheter systems consist of a plastic tube with twisted \u201cpigtail\u201d shape that collects biological fluids via large cavities in the coil and deposits them in a collection bag at the other end. The holes in the central tube, or lumen, often clog when the biological fluid is viscous or contains particulates. For this reason, it is required for nurses to \u201cflush\u201d the lumen with saline 1-3 times a day to dilute the waste to be excreted and also clear the collection cavities. Clearing the catheter can be done in two ways: incorporating a 3-way stopcock connecting the saline source, waste bag and catheter drain line so that saline can be introduced by a turn of the stopcock or by disconnecting the catheter bag and directly injecting saline. Both of these methods require physical manipulation of the device and can lead to reintroduction of waste to the body as flushing occurs in the same lumen that leads to the waste collection bag. Due to the labor intensity of this process, catheters are cleansed with saline 1-3 a day even though higher frequency would result in fewer catheter complications.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers have designed a two lumen catheter that combines the central waste removal tube with a secondary flush line. The central lumen design is augmented with extra-large holes for solid waste removal while the flush line is outfitted with small holes to allow for high pressure flushing. The flush lumen is evenly fitted with small holes facing both the internal cavity of the catheter and the surrounding biological tissue. This serves to dilute the biological fluid as it enters the catheter and also flush the lumen to the waste collection bag. Such design improvements will enhance clearing rates and reduce maintenance as physical manipulation of the device is no longer necessary. Additionally, waste is flushed towards the collection bag, eliminating reintroduction to the body.As frequent clearing is crucial, a control unit for continuous catheter flushing has also been developed. While intended for the Advanced Drainage Catheter, the control unit can be applied to any catheter system. A pump can either continually or intermittently administer saline while pulling vacuum on the central lumen, forcing waste and excess saline out. The volume in and out is continuously monitored so that an imbalance will trigger an alarm. The feedback can be directly uploaded to an electronic patient chart or even a smartphone app. The ability to continuously refresh catheter tubing means enhanced patient experience and reduced time consumption for healthcare professionals.POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:HealthcareMedical devicesCatheter manufactureADVANTAGES:Elimination of waste re-entry to bodyReduced maintenance time for healthcare professionalsReduced instances of cloggingContinuous flushing vs the standard 1-3 times a day",

For example, iron-based stents have a slow degradation rate, which leads to long-term side effects or requires eventual removal.  Magnesium stents dissolve too quickly, as do polymer stents. Zinc has generated interest for stent applications due to its ideal corrosion rate and high biocompatibility. However, pure zinc lacks the mechanical integrity required for stents. A zinc composite material could offer an ideal solution but has been difficult to develop until now.INNOVATION:UCLA researchers have developed a novel and cost-effective method to manufacture zinc-based metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs) for functional applications, such as stents. This approach uses cold compaction, followed by casting.  Ultrasonic processing further improves particle dispersion. The nanoparticles added to the zinc metal matrix enhance the mechanical properties without significantly affecting the corrosion rate.

    "ip_description": "Intro: UCLA researchers in the Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology have discovered high affinity binding affibodies to COVID-19\u2019s nucleocapsid protein that provide the basis for an ELISA-based diagnostic platform. The researchers are currently developing affibody-coated test strips for saliva detection of COVID-19 in high population settings or at home testing.\n\nBACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a highly contagious viral pneumonia causing fever and shortness of breath and since December 2019, there has been an ongoing global outbreak of the virus. The disease originates from Wuhan, China and has quickly spread to more than twenty countries within two months. As of 14 February 2019, there have been 64544 cases of infection and 1380 deaths reported. While the worldwide epidemic is expected to last until the first half of 2020, a sensitive and quick viral detection method will be essential to early diagnosis and disease control of COVID-19. Unfortunately, current RT-PCR diagnostic tests have poor sensitivity, are time-consuming, and do not enable population-wide screening in a cost-effective manner.\n\n\nINNOVATION: UCLA researchers have developed two sensitive antibody mimetics (affibody) for detecting nucleocapsid protein (NP) of COVID-19. The affibodies were developed, using an mRNA display method and can be mass-produced and purified from E. coli. The two affibodies bind SARS NP with Kd of 3.7nM and 400pM affinities. COVID-19 and SARS nucleotide sequences have 94% similarity and amino acid sequence and structural conservation level of NP N-terminal and C-terminal domains was investigated and confirmed in silico and in vitro with purified COVID-19-NP. Indeed, in vitro studies show a slightly diminished but still strong affinity of the two affibodies towards COVID-19-NP. Efforts to further increase the binding affinity for COVID-19-NP are underway. The affibodies can be detected using an ELISA- based detection method developed by the UCLA researchers. The assay has a limit of detection is around 1 to 5 pg/ml for the two affibodies rendering it a reliable, fast and facile diagnostic tool for COVID-19. Studies to prove the superiority of this method against current PCR-based methods are ongoing and so is the development of lateral flow test strips for viral detection in patient saliva.  Overall, this technology provides a much-needed rapid diagnostic for COVID-19 that upon commercialization will aid in the timely detection and control of viral dissemination.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL APPLICATIONS:\n\u2022       Viral detection\n\u2022       COVID-19 diagnostic\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\u2022       Fast and easy detection\n\u2022       Sensitive\n\u2022       Scalable production using Ecoli\n\u2022       High affinity for virus nucleocapsid protein\n\nDEVELOPMENT-TO-DATE:\nTwo affibodies have been discovered, synthesized, purified and tested against purified COVID-19-NP. Both affibodies bind COVID-19-NP with low nanomolar affinities. The researchers have developed an accompanying ELISA-based detection method for the affibodies which results in lower limits of detection around 1 to 5 pg/ml.",
