For example, a relatively infrequent action may include a critical timing path that determines the maximum clock frequency of the system. By allowing that infrequent action to take multiple clock cycles, even if that action takes more absolute time, other actions may take less absolute time by virtue of being able to operate the synchronous system at a higher clock rate. The overall system may then operate more quickly (e.g., as measured by the average number of rules applied per unit of absolute time).",

In one aspect of the invention, a particle is formed having a core and a coating. The particle may comprise a core having a material such as LiFePO4, and a coating. The particle may be formed, in some embodiments, by using a non-stoichiometric combination of salts or other precursors, and sintering the same to form particles. LiFePO4 may form as the core of the particle, while the remaining materials may form a coating around the LiFePO4. Typically, the LiFePO4 is crystalline while the coating is generally amorphous, and in some instances, the coating may prevent large crystals of LiFePO4 from forming. However, in other embodiments, a coating may be applied to a particle after formation of the particle to form a core/coating structure. The particles disclosed herein may have a relatively high energy capacity, and thus may find use in batteries and other energy storage devices.

    "ip_description": "The use of porous electrodes in batteries improves energy and power density in various types of batteries, including primary and rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.\n\n**Problem Addressed**\n\nThe pore space in rechargeable batteries has a high tortuosity (effective path length over projected path), which causes energy density of the battery to be limited at a given power level. Current design and fabrication methods of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries involve manufacturing thin laminates of powder-based electrodes, which are highly compressed, and subsequently infused with inorganic liquid electrolytes. Although powder-based electrodes are the lowest-cost forms of metal oxide or carbon-based electrode-active materials, such electrodes have a substantial amount of electrochemically-inactive material. This invention uses a high volume fraction of electrode-active material, in which the existing porosity, which is filled with electrolyte, has a low tortuosity in the primary direction of ion transport during charge and discharge of the battery. The use of low tortuosity electrodes while also maintaining high active materials volume fraction compensates for the decrease in energy density of the battery created with highly porous electrodes.\n\n**Technology**\n\nThis invention describes a design and manufacturing process of aligned-porosity, high energy density and low tortuosity electrodes. Such electrodes are manufactured by a directional freeze-casting process that involves a ceramic suspension of solid particles in a liquid, producing unidirectional crystals. The invention also provides means to manipulate the porosity and microstructure of the ceramic structures by changing the processing parameters such as initial slurry concentration. Additionally, additives can be mixed in the ceramic slurry to modify the crystalline structure of ice. After subsequent freeze drying, these changes are replicated in the ceramic structure and lead to improved performance of the final product.\n\n**Advantages**\n\n*   Increases energy density\n*   Low tortuosity\n*   Maintains high active materials volume fraction",

The plurality of nanostructures may be provided such that their long axes are substantially aligned and, in some cases, continuous from end to end of the sample. For example, in some cases, the nanostructures may be fabricated by uniformly growing the nanostructures on the surface of a substrate, such that the long axes are aligned and non-parallel to the substrate surface. The nanostructures may be, in some instances, substantially perpendicular to the substrate surface. In one set of embodiments, a force with a component normal to the long axes of the nanostructures may be applied to the substantially aligned nanostructures. The application of a force may result in a material comprising a relatively high volume fraction or mass density of nanostructures. In some instances, the application of a force may result in a material comprising relatively closely-spaced nanostructures. The materials described herein may be further processed for use in various applications, such as composite materials (e.g., nanocomposites).
